the
speaker

the
anna

maid
of
honor
and
favorite
of
the
empress
marya
with
these
words
she
greeted
prince
vasili
a
man
of
high
rank
and
who

the
first

her
anna
pavlovna

had
a
cough

suffering
from
la
grippe
being
then
a
new
word
in
used
only
by
the
all
her
invitations
without
written
in
and
delivered
by
a
footman
that
ran
as

nothing
better
to
count

prospect
of

an
evening
with
a
poor
invalid

charmed

the
least
disconcerted

he
had
just
wearing
an
embroidered
court
knee
and
and
had
stars
on
his
breast
and
a
serene
expression
on
his
flat
he
spoke
in
that
refined
french
in
which
our
grandfathers
not
only
spoke
but
and
with
the
patronizing
intonation
natural
to
a
man
of
importance
who
had
grown
old
in
society
and
at
he
went
up
to
anna
kissed
her
presenting
to
her
his
and
shining
and
complacently
seated
himself
on
the
of
dear
tell
me
how
you
set
your
mind
at
said
he
without
altering
his
beneath
the
politeness
and
affected
sympathy
of
which
indifference
and
even
irony
could
be
one
be
well
while
suffering
can
one
be
calm
in
times
like
these

the
prince
in
a
listless
has
been
they
have
decided
that
buonaparte
has
burnt
his
and
i
believe
that
we
are
ready
to
burn
prince
vasili
always
spoke
like
an
actor
repeating
a
stale
anna
pavlovna
scherer
on
the
despite
her
forty
overflowed
with
animation
and
to
be
an
enthusiast
had
become
her
social
vocation
sometimes
even
when
she
did
not
feel
like
she
became
enthusiastic
in
order
not
to
disappoint
the
expectations
of
those
who
knew
the
subdued
smile
though
it
did
not
suit
her
faded
always
played
round
her
lips
as
in
a
spoiled
a
continual
consciousness
of
her
charming
which
she
neither
nor
nor
considered
it
to
in
the
midst
of
a
conversation
on
political
matters
anna
pavlovna
burst
speak
to
me
of
perhaps
i
understand
but
austria
never
has
and
does
not
for
she
is
betraying
russia
alone
must
save
our
gracious
sovereign
recognizes
his
high
vocation
and
will
be
true
to
that
is
the
one
thing
i
have
faith
our
good
and
wonderful
sovereign
has
to
perform
the
noblest
role
on
and
he
is
so
virtuous
and
noble
that
god
will
not
forsake
he
will
fulfill
his
vocation
and
crush
the
hydra
of
which
has
become
more
terrible
than
ever
in
the
person
of
this
murderer
and
we
alone
must
avenge
the
blood
of
the
just
i
ask
can
we
rely
england
with
her
commercial
spirit
will
not
and
cannot
understand
the
emperor
loftiness
of
she
has
refused
to
evacuate
she
wanted
to
and
still
some
secret
motive
in
our
what
answer
did
novosiltsev
the
english
have
not
understood
and
cannot
understand
the
of
our
emperor
who
wants
nothing
for
but
only
desires
the
good
of
and
what
have
they
and
what
little
they
have
promised
they
will
not
prussia
has
always
declared
that
buonaparte
is
and
that
all
europe
is
powerless
before
and
i
believe
a
word
that
hardenburg
or
haugwitz
this
famous
prussian
neutrality
is
just
a
i
have
faith
only
in
god
and
the
lofty
destiny
of
our
adored
he
will
save
she
suddenly
smiling
at
her
own
said
the
prince
with
a
if
you
had
been
sent
instead
of
our
dear
wintzingerode
you
would
have
captured
the
king
of
consent
by
you
are
so
will
you
give
me
a
cup
of
a
a
she
becoming
calm
am
expecting
two
very
interesting
men
le
vicomte
de
who
is
connected
with
the
montmorencys
through
the
one
of
the
best
french
he
is
one
of
the
genuine
the
good
and
also
the
abbe
do
you
know
that
profound
he
has
been
received
by
the
had
you
shall
be
delighted
to
meet
said
the
tell
he
added
with
studied
carelessness
as
if
it
had
only
just
occurred
to
though
the
question
he
was
about
to
ask
was
the
chief
motive
of
his
it
true
that
the
dowager
empress
wants
baron
funke
to
be
appointed
first
secretary
at
the
baron
by
all
accounts
is
a
poor
prince
vasili
wished
to
obtain
this
post
for
his
but
others
were
trying
through
the
dowager
empress
marya
fedorovna
to
secure
it
for
the
anna
pavlovna
almost
closed
her
eyes
to
indicate
that
neither
she
nor
anyone
else
had
a
right
to
criticize
what
the
empress
desired
or
was
pleased
funke
has
been
recommended
to
the
dowager
empress
by
her
was
all
she
in
a
dry
and
mournful
as
she
named
the
anna
face
suddenly
assumed
an
expression
of
profound
and
sincere
devotion
and
respect
mingled
with
and
this
occurred
every
time
she
mentioned
her
illustrious
she
added
that
her
majesty
had
deigned
to
show
baron
funke
beaucoup
and
again
her
face
clouded
over
with
the
prince
was
silent
and
looked
with
the
womanly
and
courtierlike
quickness
and
tact
habitual
to
anna
pavlovna
wished
both
to
rebuke
him
daring
to
speak
as
he
had
done
of
a
man
recommended
to
the
and
at
the
same
time
to
console
so
she
about
your
do
you
know
that
since
your
daughter
came
out
everyone
has
been
enraptured
by
they
say
she
is
amazingly
the
prince
bowed
to
signify
his
respect
and
often
she
continued
after
a
short
drawing
nearer
to
the
prince
and
smiling
amiably
at
him
as
if
to
show
that
political
and
social
topics
were
ended
and
the
time
had
come
for
intimate
often
think
how
unfairly
sometimes
the
joys
of
life
are
why
has
fate
given
you
two
such
splendid
i
speak
of
your
i
like
she
added
in
a
tone
admitting
of
no
rejoinder
and
raising
her
such
charming
and
really
you
appreciate
them
less
than
and
so
you
deserve
to
have
and
she
smiled
her
ecstatic
help
said
the
would
have
said
i
lack
the
bump
of
i
mean
to
have
a
serious
talk
with
do
you
know
i
am
dissatisfied
with
your
younger
between
her
face
assumed
its
melancholy
was
mentioned
at
her
and
you
were
the
prince
answered
but
she
looked
at
him
awaiting
a
he
would
you
have
me
he
said
at
know
i
did
all
a
father
could
for
their
and
they
have
both
turned
out
hippolyte
is
at
least
a
quiet
but
anatole
is
an
active
that
is
the
only
difference
between
he
said
this
smiling
in
a
way
more
natural
and
animated
than
so
that
the
wrinkles
round
his
mouth
very
clearly
revealed
something
unexpectedly
coarse
and
why
are
children
born
to
such
men
as
if
you
were
not
a
father
there
would
be
nothing
i
could
reproach
you
said
anna
looking
up

your
faithful
slave
and
to
you
alone
i
can
confess
that
my
children
are
the
bane
of
my
it
is
the
cross
i
have
to
that
is
how
i
explain
it
to
it
be
he
said
no
but
expressed
his
resignation
to
cruel
fate
by
a
anna
pavlovna

never
thought
of
marrying
your
prodigal
son

say
old
maids

a
mania
for
and
though
i
feel
that
weakness
in
myself

very
unhappy
with
her

a
relation
of
princess

prince
vasili
did
not
with
the
quickness
of
memory
and
perception
befitting
a
man
of
the
he
indicated
by
a
movement
of
the
head
that
he
was
considering
this

said
at
evidently
unable
to
check
the
sad
current
of
his
anatole

costing
me

thousand
rubles

he
went
on
after
a

highest

assembled
people
differing
widely
in
age
and
character
but
alike
in
the
social
circle
to
which
they
prince
the
beautiful
came
to
take
her
father
to
the
she
wore
a
ball
dress
and
her

youthful
little
princess

seduisante

been
married
during
the
previous

being
pregnant

not
go
to
any
large
but
only
to
small
prince
had
come
with
whom
he
the
abbe
morio
and
many
others
had
also
the
most
fascinating
woman
in
to
each
new
arrival
anna
pavlovna
have
not
yet
seen
my
or
do
not
know
my
and
very
gravely
conducted
him
or
her
to
a
little
old
wearing
large
bows
of
ribbon
in
her
who
had
come
sailing
in
from
another
room
as
soon
as
the
guests
began
to
and
slowly
turning
her
eyes
from
the
visitor
to
her
anna
pavlovna
mentioned
each
name
and
then
left
each
visitor
performed
the
ceremony
of
greeting
this
old
aunt
whom
not
one
of
them
not
one
of
them
wanted
to
and
not
one
of
them
cared
anna
pavlovna
observed
these
greetings
with
mournful
and
solemn
interest
and
silent
the
aunt
spoke
to
each
of
them
in
the
same
about
their
health
and
her
and
the
health
of
her
thank
was
better
and
each
though
politeness
prevented
his
showing
left
the
old
woman
with
a
sense
of
relief
at
having
performed
a
vexatious
duty
and
did
not
return
to
her
the
whole
the
young
princess
bolkonskaya
had
brought
some
work
in
a
embroidered
velvet
her
pretty
little
upper
on
which
a
delicate
dark
down
was
just
was
too
short
for
her
but
it
lifted
all
the
more
and
was
especially
charming
when
she
occasionally
drew
it
down
to
meet
the
lower
as
is
always
the
case
with
a
thoroughly
attractive
her
shortness
of
her
upper
lip
and
her
to
be
her
own
special
and
peculiar
form
of
everyone
brightened
at
the
sight
of
this
pretty
young
so
soon
to
become
a
so
full
of
life
and
and
carrying
her
burden
so
old
men
and
dull
dispirited
young
ones
who
looked
at
after
being
in
her
company
and
talking
to
her
a
little
felt
as
if
they
too
were
like
full
of
life
and
all
who
talked
to
and
at
each
word
saw
her
bright
smile
and
the
constant
gleam
of
her
white
thought
that
they
were
in
a
specially
amiable
mood
that
the
little
princess
went
round
the
table
with
swaying
her
workbag
on
her
and
gaily
spreading
out
her
dress
sat
down
on
a
sofa
near
the
silver
as
if
all
she
was
doing
was
a
pleasure
to
herself
and
to
all
around
have
brought
my
said
she
in
displaying
her
bag
and
addressing
all
i
hope
you
have
not
played
a
wicked
trick
on
she
turning
to
her
wrote
that
it
was
to
be
quite
a
small
and
just
see
how
badly
i
am
and
she
spread
out
her
arms
to
show
her
dainty
gray
girdled
with
a
broad
ribbon
just
below
the
you
will
always
be
prettier
than
anyone
replied
anna
said
the
princess
in
the
same
tone
of
voice
and
still
in
turning
to
a
husband
is
deserting
he
is
going
to
get
himself
tell
me
what
this
wretched
war
is
she
addressing
prince
and
without
waiting
for
an
answer
she
turned
to
speak
to
his
the
beautiful
a
delightful
woman
this
little
princess
said
prince
vasili
to
anna
one
of
the
next
arrivals
was
a
heavily
built
young
man
with
the
breeches
fashionable
at
that
a
very
high
and
a
brown
dress
this
stout
young
man
was
an
illegitimate
son
of
count
a
grandee
of
time
who
now
lay
dying
in
the
young
man
had
not
yet
entered
either
the
military
or
civil
as
he
had
only
just
returned
from
abroad
where
he
had
been
and
this
was
his
first
appearance
in
anna
pavlovna
greeted
him
with
the
nod
she
accorded
to
the
lowest
hierarchy
in
her
drawing
but
in
spite
of
this
a
look
of
anxiety
and
as
at
the
sight
of
something
too
large
and
unsuited
to
the
came
over
her
face
when
she
saw
pierre
though
he
was
certainly
rather
bigger
than
the
other
men
in
the
her
anxiety
could
only
have
reference
to
the
clever
though
but
observant
and
expression
which
distinguished
him
from
everyone
else
in
that
drawing
is
very
good
of
monsieur
to
come
and
visit
a
poor
said
anna
exchanging
an
alarmed
glance
with
her
aunt
as
she
conducted
him
to
pierre
murmured
something
and
continued
to
look
round
as
if
in
search
of
on
his
way
to
the
aunt
he
bowed
to
the
little
princess
with
a
pleased
as
to
an
intimate
anna
alarm
was
for
pierre
turned
away
from
the
aunt
without
waiting
to
hear
her
speech
about
her
anna
pavlovna
in
dismay
detained
him
with
the
you
know
the
abbe
he
is
a
most
interesting
i
have
heard
of
his
scheme
for
perpetual
and
it
is
very
interesting
but
hardly
think
rejoined
anna
pavlovna
in
order
to
say
something
and
get
away
to
attend
to
her
duties
as
but
pierre
now
committed
a
reverse
act
of
first
he
had
left
a
lady
before
she
had
finished
speaking
to
and
now
he
continued
to
speak
to
another
who
wished
to
get
with
his
head
and
his
big
feet
spread
he
began
explaining
his
reasons
for
thinking
the
plan
will
talk
of
it
said
anna
pavlovna
with
a
and
having
got
rid
of
this
young
man
who
did
not
know
how
to
she
resumed
her
duties
as
hostess
and
continued
to
listen
and
ready
to
help
at
any
point
where
the
conversation
might
happen
to
as
the
foreman
of
a
spinning
when
he
has
set
the
hands
to
goes
round
and
notices
here
a
spindle
that
has
stopped
or
there
one
that
creaks
or
makes
more
noise
than
it
and
hastens
to
check
the
machine
or
set
it
in
proper
so
anna
pavlovna
moved
about
her
drawing
approaching
now
a
now
a
and
by
a
word
or
slight
rearrangement
kept
the
conversational
machine
in
and
regular
but
amid
these
cares
her
anxiety
about
pierre
was
she
kept
an
anxious
watch
on
him
when
he
approached
the
group
round
mortemart
to
listen
to
what
was
being
said
and
again
when
he
passed
to
another
group
whose
center
was
the
pierre
had
been
educated
and
this
reception
at
anna
was
the
first
he
had
attended
in
he
knew
that
all
the
intellectual
lights
of
petersburg
were
gathered
there
like
a
child
in
a
did
not
know
which
way
to
afraid
of
missing
any
clever
conversation
that
was
to
be
seeing
the
and
refined
expression
on
the
faces
of
those
present
he
was
always
expecting
to
hear
something
very
at
last
he
came
up
to
here
the
conversation
seemed
interesting
and
he
stood
waiting
for
an
opportunity
to
express
his
own
as
young
people
are
fond
of
chapter
iii
anna
reception
was
in
full
the
spindles
hummed
steadily
and
ceaselessly
on
all
with
the
exception
of
the
beside
whom
sat
only
one
elderly
who
with
her
thin
careworn
face
was
rather
out
of
place
in
this
brilliant
the
whole
company
had
settled
into
three
chiefly
had
formed
round
the
of
young
was
grouped
round
the
beautiful
princess
prince
and
the
little
princess
very
pretty
and
though
rather
too
plump
for
her
the
third
group
was
gathered
round
mortemart
and
anna
the
vicomte
was
a
young
man
with
soft
features
and
polished
who
evidently
considered
himself
a
celebrity
but
out
of
politeness
modestly
placed
himself
at
the
disposal
of
the
circle
in
which
he
found
anna
pavlovna
was
obviously
serving
him
up
as
a
treat
to
her
as
a
clever
maitre
serves
up
as
a
specially
choice
delicacy
a
piece
of
meat
that
no
one
who
had
seen
it
in
the
kitchen
would
have
cared
to
so
anna
pavlovna
served
up
to
her
first
the
vicomte
and
then
the
as
peculiarly
choice
the
group
about
mortemart
immediately
began
discussing
the
murder
of
the
duc
the
vicomte
said
that
the
duc
had
perished
by
his
own
and
that
there
were
particular
reasons
for
hatred
of
do
tell
us
all
about
said
anna
with
a
pleasant
feeling
that
there
was
something
a
la
louis
xv
in
the
sound
of
that
nous
the
vicomte
bowed
and
smiled
courteously
in
token
of
his
willingness
to
anna
pavlovna
arranged
a
group
round
inviting
everyone
to
listen
to
his
vicomte
knew
the
duc
whispered
anna
pavlovna
to
one
of
the
vicomte
is
a
wonderful
said
she
to
evidently
he
belongs
to
the
best
said
she
to
a
and
the
vicomte
was
served
up
to
the
company
in
the
choicest
and
most
advantageous
like
a
joint
of
roast
beef
on
a
hot
the
vicomte
wished
to
begin
his
story
and
gave
a
subtle
over
said
anna
pavlovna
to
the
beautiful
young
princess
who
was
sitting
some
way
the
center
of
another
the
princess
she
rose
with
the
same
unchanging
smile
with
which
she
had
first
entered
the
smile
of
a
perfectly
beautiful
with
a
slight
rustle
of
her
white
dress
trimmed
with
moss
and
with
a
gleam
of
white
glossy
and
sparkling
she
passed
between
the
men
who
made
way
for
not
looking
at
any
of
them
but
smiling
on
as
if
graciously
allowing
each
the
privilege
of
admiring
her
beautiful
figure
and
shapely
and
in
the
fashion
of
those
days
were
very
much
and
she
seemed
to
bring
the
glamour
of
a
ballroom
with
her
as
she
moved
toward
anna
helene
was
so
lovely
that
not
only
did
she
not
show
any
trace
of
but
on
the
contrary
she
even
appeared
shy
of
her
unquestionable
and
all
too
victorious
she
seemed
to
but
to
be
to
diminish
its
said
everyone
who
saw
and
the
vicomte
lifted
his
shoulders
and
dropped
his
eyes
as
if
startled
by
something
extraordinary
when
she
took
her
seat
opposite
and
beamed
upon
him
also
with
her
unchanging
i
doubt
my
ability
before
such
an
said
smilingly
inclining
his
the
princess
rested
her
bare
round
arm
on
a
little
table
and
considered
a
reply
she
smilingly
all
the
time
the
story
was
being
told
she
sat
glancing
now
at
her
beautiful
round
altered
in
shape
by
its
pressure
on
the
now
at
her
still
more
beautiful
on
which
she
readjusted
a
diamond
from
time
to
time
she
smoothed
the
folds
of
her
and
whenever
the
story
produced
an
effect
she
glanced
at
anna
at
once
adopted
just
the
expression
she
saw
on
the
maid
of
and
again
relapsed
into
her
radiant
the
little
princess
had
also
left
the
tea
table
and
followed
a
get
my
now
what
are
you
thinking
she
went
turning
to
prince
me
my
there
was
a
general
movement
as
the
smiling
and
talking
merrily
to
everyone
at
sat
down
and
gaily
arranged
herself
in
her
i
am
all
she
and
asking
the
vicomte
to
she
took
up
her
prince
having
brought
the
joined
the
circle
and
moving
a
chair
close
to
hers
seated
himself
beside
le
charmant
hippolyte
was
surprising
by
his
extraordinary
resemblance
to
his
beautiful
but
yet
more
by
the
fact
that
in
spite
of
this
resemblance
he
was
exceedingly
his
features
were
like
his
but
while
in
her
case
everything
was
lit
up
by
a
and
constant
smile
of
and
by
the
wonderful
classic
beauty
of
her
his
face
on
the
contrary
was
dulled
by
imbecility
and
a
constant
expression
of
sullen
while
his
body
was
thin
and
his
and
mouth
all
seemed
puckered
into
a
wearied
and
his
arms
and
legs
always
fell
into
unnatural
not
going
to
be
a
ghost
said
sitting
down
beside
the
princess
and
hastily
adjusting
his
as
if
without
this
instrument
he
could
not
begin
to
my
dear
said
the
astonished
shrugging
his
i
hate
ghost
said
prince
hippolyte
in
a
tone
which
showed
that
he
only
understood
the
meaning
of
his
words
after
he
had
uttered
he
spoke
with
such
that
his
hearers
could
not
be
sure
whether
what
he
said
was
very
witty
or
very
he
was
dressed
in
a
dress
knee
breeches
of
the
color
of
cuisse
de
nymphe
as
he
called
and
silk
the
vicomte
told
his
tale
very
it
was
an
then
to
the
effect
that
the
duc
had
gone
secretly
to
paris
to
visit
mademoiselle
that
at
her
house
he
came
upon
who
also
enjoyed
the
famous
and
that
in
his
presence
napoleon
happened
to
fall
into
one
of
the
fainting
fits
to
which
he
was
and
was
thus
at
the
the
latter
spared
and
this
magnanimity
bonaparte
subsequently
repaid
by
the
story
was
very
pretty
and
especially
at
the
point
where
the
rivals
suddenly
recognized
one
and
the
ladies
looked
said
anna
pavlovna
with
an
inquiring
glance
at
the
little
whispered
the
little
sticking
the
needle
into
her
work
as
if
to
testify
that
the
interest
and
fascination
of
the
story
prevented
her
from
going
on
with
the
vicomte
appreciated
this
silent
praise
and
smiling
gratefully
prepared
to
but
just
then
anna
who
had
kept
a
watchful
eye
on
the
young
man
who
so
alarmed
noticed
that
he
was
talking
too
loudly
and
vehemently
with
the
so
she
hurried
to
the
pierre

managed
to
start
a
conversation
with
the
abbe
about
the
balance
of

the
evidently
interested
by
the
young
was
explaining
his
pet
both
were
talking
and
listening
too
eagerly
and
too
which
was
why
anna
pavlovna
means
the
balance
of
power
in
europe
and
the
rights
of
the
the
abbe
was
is
only
necessary
for
one
powerful
nation
like
as
she
is
said
to
place
herself
disinterestedly
at
the
head
of
an
alliance
having
for
its
object
the
maintenance
of
the
balance
of
power
of

it
would
save
the
how

you
to

at
that
moment
anna
pavlovna
came
up
looking
severely
at

the

how
he
stood

face
instantly
changed
and
assumed
an
offensively
sugary
evidently
habitual
to
him
when
conversing
with

so
enchanted
by
the
brilliancy
of
the
wit
and
culture
of

in
which
i
have
had
the
honor

a
very
handsome
young

medium
with
clearcut
everything
about

his
bored
expression
to
his
measured

a
most
striking
contrast
to
his
little

was
evident
that
he
not
only
knew
everyone
in
the
drawing
but
had
found
them
to
be
so
tiresome
that
it
wearied
him
to
look
at
or
listen
to
and
among
all
these
faces
that
he
found
so
none
seemed
to
bore
him
so
much
as
that
of
his
pretty

turned
away
from

with
a
grimace
that
distorted

and
pressing

to
show
that
there
was
no
need
to

something

at
that
moment

sighing
he
again
changed
his
prince
who
had
been
gazing
at
the
vicomte
for
some
time
through
his
suddenly
turned
completely
round
toward
the
little
and
having
asked
for
a
needle
began
tracing
the
conde
coat
of
arms
on
the

explained
this
to
her
with
as
much
gravity
as
if
she
had
asked
him
to
do

said
the
princess
buonaparte
remains
on
the
throne
of
france
a
year
the
vicomte
with
the
air
of
a
man
in
a
matter
with
which
he
is
better
acquainted
than
anyone
does
not
listen
to
others
but
follows
the
current
of
his
own
will
have
gone
too
by
and
french
mean
good
french
have
been
forever
and
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
spread
out
his
pierre
wished
to
make
a
for
the
conversation
interested
but
anna
who
had
him
under
emperor
said
with
the
melancholy
which
always
accompanied
any
reference
of
hers
to
the
imperial
declared
that
he
will
leave
it
to
the
french
people
themselves
to
choose
their
own
form
of
and
i
believe
that
once
free
from
the
the
whole
nation
will
certainly
throw
itself
into
the
arms
of
its
rightful
she
trying
to
be
amiable
to
the
royalist
is
said
prince
le
vicomte
quite
rightly
supposes
that
matters
have
already
gone
too
i
think
it
will
be
difficult
to
return
to
the
old
what
i
have
said
blushing
and
breaking
into
the
all
the
aristocracy
has
already
gone
over
to
is
the
buonapartists
who
say
replied
the
vicomte
without
looking
at
the
present
time
it
is
difficult
to
know
the
real
state
of
french
public
has
said
remarked
prince
andrew
with
a
sarcastic
it
was
evident
that
he
did
not
like
the
vicomte
and
was
aiming
his
remarks
at
though
without
looking
at
showed
them
the
path
to
but
they
did
not
follow
prince
andrew
continued
after
a
short
again
quoting
opened
my
antechambers
and
they
crowded
i
do
not
know
how
far
he
was
justified
in
saying
in
the
replied
the
the
murder
of
the
duc
even
the
most
partial
ceased
to
regard
him
as
a
if
to
some
he
went
turning
to
anna
ever
was
a
after
the
murder
of
the
duc
there
was
one
martyr
more
in
heaven
and
one
hero
less
on
before
anna
pavlovna
and
the
others
had
time
to
smile
their
appreciation
of
the
pierre
again
broke
into
the
and
though
anna
pavlovna
felt
sure
he
would
say
something
she
was
unable
to
stop
execution
of
the
duc
declared
monsieur
a
political
and
it
seems
to
me
that
napoleon
showed
greatness
of
soul
by
not
fearing
to
take
on
himself
the
whole
responsibility
of
that
mon
muttered
anna
pavlovna
in
a
terrified
monsieur
do
you
consider
that
assassination
shows
greatness
of
said
the
little
smiling
and
drawing
her
work
nearer
to
exclaimed
several
said
prince
hippolyte
in
and
began
slapping
his
knee
with
the
palm
of
his
the
vicomte
merely
shrugged
his
pierre
looked
solemnly
at
his
audience
over
his
spectacles
and
say
he
continued
the
bourbons
fled
from
the
revolution
leaving
the
people
to
and
napoleon
alone
understood
the
revolution
and
quelled
and
so
for
the
general
he
could
not
stop
short
for
the
sake
of
one
you
come
over
to
the
other
suggested
anna
but
pierre
continued
his
speech
without
heeding
cried
becoming
more
and
more
is
great
because
he
rose
superior
to
the
suppressed
its
preserved
all
that
was
good
in
of
citizenship
and
freedom
of
speech
and
of
the
only
for
that
reason
did
he
obtain
if
having
obtained
without
availing
himself
of
it
to
commit
murder
he
had
restored
it
to
the
rightful
i
should
have
called
him
a
great
remarked
the
could
not
do
the
people
only
gave
him
power
that
he
might
rid
them
of
the
bourbons
and
because
they
saw
that
he
was
a
great
the
revolution
was
a
grand
continued
monsieur
betraying
by
this
desperate
and
provocative
proposition
his
extreme
youth
and
his
wish
to
express
all
that
was
in
his
revolution
and
regicide
a
grand
after
but
you
come
to
this
other
repeated
anna
contrat
said
the
vicomte
with
a
tolerant
am
not
speaking
of
i
am
speaking
about
ideas
of

again
interjected
an
ironical
were
no
but
they
are
not
what
is
most
what
is
important
are
the
rights
of
emancipation
from
and
equality
of
and
all
these
ideas
napoleon
has
retained
in
full
and
said
the
vicomte
as
if
at
last
deciding
seriously
to
prove
to
this
youth
how
foolish
his
words
words
which
have
long
been
who
does
not
love
liberty
and
even
our
saviour
preached
liberty
and
have
people
since
the
revolution
become
on
the
we
wanted
but
buonaparte
has
destroyed
prince
andrew
kept
looking
with
an
amused
smile
from
pierre
to
the
vicomte
and
from
the
vicomte
to
their
in
the
first
moment
of
outburst
anna
despite
her
social
was
but
when
she
saw
that
sacrilegious
words
had
not
exasperated
the
and
had
convinced
herself
that
it
was
impossible
to
stop
she
rallied
her
forces
and
joined
the
vicomte
in
a
vigorous
attack
on
the
my
dear
monsieur
said
do
you
explain
the
fact
of
a
great
man
executing
a
even
an
ordinary
man
innocent
and
should
said
the
ask
how
monsieur
explains
the
18th
was
not
that
an
it
was
a
and
not
at
all
like
the
conduct
of
a
great
the
prisoners
he
killed
in
that
was
said
the
little
shrugging
her
a
low
say
what
you
remarked
prince
not
knowing
whom
to
looked
at
them
all
and
his
smile
was
unlike
the
of
other
when
he
his
even
rather
look
was
instantaneously
replaced
by
even
rather
silly
which
seemed
to
ask
the
vicomte
who
was
meeting
him
for
the
first
time
saw
clearly
that
this
young
jacobin
was
not
so
terrible
as
his
words
all
were
do
you
expect
him
to
answer
you
all
at
said
prince
in
the
actions
of
a
statesman
one
has
to
distinguish
between
his
acts
as
a
private
as
a
and
as
an
so
it
seems
to
of
pierre
chimed
pleased
at
the
arrival
of
this
must
continued
prince
napoleon
as
a
man
was
great
on
the
bridge
of
and
in
the
hospital
at
jaffa
where
he
gave
his
hand
to
the
but
there
are
other
acts
which
it
is
difficult
to
prince
who
had
evidently
wished
to
tone
down
the
awkwardness
of
rose
and
made
a
sign
to
his
wife
that
it
was
time
to
suddenly
prince
hippolyte
started
up
making
signs
to
everyone
to
and
asking
them
all
to
be
seated
was
told
a
charming
moscow
story
today
and
must
treat
you
to
excuse
must
tell
it
in
russian
or
the
point
will
be
and
prince
hippolyte
began
to
tell
his
story
in
such
russian
as
a
frenchman
would
speak
after
spending
about
a
year
in
everyone
so
emphatically
and
eagerly
did
he
demand
their
attention
to
his

moscow

she

must
have
two
footmen
behind
her

collecting
his

up

come
with
me
while
i
make
some

prince
hippolyte
spluttered
and
burst
out
laughing
long
before
his
which
produced
an
effect
unfavorable
to
the
several
among
them
the
elderly
lady
and
anna

suddenly
there
was
a

hair

could
contain
himself
no
longer

went
between
gasps
of
the
whole
world

so
the

it
was
unintelligible
why
he
had
told
or
why
it

to
be

agreeably

and
unamiable
after

conversation
broke
up
into

about
the

next
about

who
would

not

for
a
long
as

gracefully

glancing
at

asked

amid

not

how

that

andrew
only
shrugged
his
shoulders
at
childish
he
put
on
the
air
of
one
who
finds
it
impossible
to
reply
to
such
but
it
would
in
fact
have
been
difficult
to
give
any
other
answer
than
the

andrew
gave
to
this
naive

on
his

the
rustle
of
a
dress
was
heard
in
the

andrew
shook
himself
as
if
waking
and
his
face
assumed
the
look
it
had
had
in
anna
drawing

removed
his
feet
from

came
she
had
changed
her
gown
for
a
house

as
fresh
and
elegant
as
the
prince
andrew
rose
and
politely
placed
a
chair
for

fussily

how
stupid
you

no
sense
about
what
an
argumentative

addressing
the
princess
with
none
of
the
embarrassment
so
commonly
shown
by
young
men
in
their
intercourse
with
young

evidently
words
touched
her
to
the
that
is
just
what
i
tell

i
in
the
least
understand
why
men
live
without

you
shall
judge
between

speaking
of
how
to
arrange
what
do
you
pierre
looked
at
his
friend
noticing
that
he
did
not
like
the
gave
no
are
you
he
speak
of
his
i
hear
it
spoken
said
the
princess
in
the
same
petulantly
playful
tone
in
which
she
had
spoken
to
hippolyte
in
the
drawing
room
and
which
was
so
plainly
to
the
family
circle
of
which
pierre
was
almost
a
when
i
remembered
that
all
these
delightful
associations
must
be
broken
and
then
you
looked
significantly
at
her
she
and
a
shudder
ran
down
her
her
husband
looked
at
her
as
if
surprised
to
notice
that
someone
besides
pierre
and
himself
was
in
the
and
addressed
her
in
a
tone
of
frigid
is
it
you
are
afraid
i
said
what
egotists
men
all
all
just
for
a
whim
of
his
goodness
only
knows
he
leaves
me
and
locks
me
up
alone
in
the
my
father
and
said
prince
andrew
all
the
without
my
and
he
expects
me
not
to
be
her
tone
was
now
querulous
and
her
lip
drawn
giving
her
not
a
but
an
she
paused
as
if
she
felt
it
indecorous
to
speak
of
her
pregnancy
before
though
the
gist
of
the
matter
lay
in
still
understand
what
you
are
afraid
said
prince
andrew
not
taking
his
eyes
off
his
the
princess
and
raised
her
arms
with
a
gesture
of
i
must
say
you
have
how
you
doctor
tells
you
to
go
to
bed
said
prince
had
better
the
princess
said
but
suddenly
her
short
downy
lip
prince
andrew
shrugged
his
and
walked
about
the
pierre
looked
over
his
spectacles
with
naive
now
at
him
and
now
at

as
if
about
to
rise
but

exclaimed
the
little
princess
her
pretty
face
all
at
once
distorted
by
a
tearful
have
long
wanted
to
ask
why
you
have
changed
so
to
what
have
i
done
to
you
are
going
to
the
war
and
have
no
pity
for
why
is
was
all
prince
andrew
but
that
one
word
expressed
an
a
and
above
all
conviction
that
she
would
herself
regret
her
but
she
went
on
treat
me
like
an
invalid
or
a
i
see
it
did
you
behave
like
that
six
months

said
prince
andrew
still
more
who
had
been
growing
more
and
more
agitated
as
he
listened
to
all
rose
and
approached
the
he
seemed
unable
to
bear
the
sight
of
tears
and
was
ready
to
cry
it
seems
so
to
you
i
assure
you
i
myself

andrew

him

princess
is
too
kind
to
wish
to
deprive
me
of
the
pleasure
of
spending
the
evening
with
he
thinks
only
of
muttered
the
princess
without
restraining
her
angry
said
prince
andrew
raising
his
voice
to
the
pitch
which
indicates
that
patience
is
suddenly
the
expression
of
the
pretty
face
changed
into
a
winning
and
piteous
look
of
her
beautiful
eyes
glanced
askance
at
her
and
her
own
assumed
the
deprecating
expression
of
a
dog
when
it
rapidly
but
feebly
wags
its
drooping
mon
she
and
lifting
her
dress
with
one
hand
she
went
up
to
her
husband
and
kissed
him
on
the
said
rising
and
courteously
kissing
her
hand
as
he
would
have
done
to
a
chapter

the
friends

cared

at

rubbed
his
forehead
with
his
small

said
with
a
going
to
the
they
entered
the
newly
and
luxurious
dining
everything
from
the
table
napkins
to
the
and
glass
bore
that
imprint
of
newness
found
in
the
households
of
the
newly
halfway
through
supper
prince
andrew
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
table
with
a
look
of
nervous
agitation
such
as
pierre
had
never
before
seen
on
his
began
to
one
who
has
long
had
something
on
his
mind
and
suddenly
determines
to
speak
never
my
dear
my
never
marry
till
you
can
say
to
yourself
that
you
have
done
all
you
are
capable
and
until
you
have
ceased
to
love
the
woman
of
your
choice
and
have
seen
her
plainly
as
she
or
else
you
will
make
a
cruel
and
irrevocable
marry
when
you
are
old
and
good
for
all
that
is
good
and
noble
in
you
will
be
it
will
all
be
wasted
on
look
at
me
with
such
if
you
marry
expecting
anything
from
yourself
in
the
you
will
feel
at
every
step
that
for
you
all
is
all
is
closed
except
the
drawing
where
you
will
be
ranged
side
by
side
with
a
court
lackey
and
an
but
the
and
he
waved
his
pierre
took
off
his
which
made
his
face
seem
different
and
the
expression
still
more
and
gazed
at
his
friend
in
continued
prince
an
excellent
one
of
those
rare
women
with
whom
a
honor
is
o
what
would
i
not
give
now
to
be
you
are
the
first
and
only
one
to
whom
i
mention
because
i
like
as
he
said
this
prince
andrew
was
less
than
ever
like
that
bolkonski
who
had
lolled
in
anna
easy
chairs
and
with
eyes
had
uttered
french
phrases
between
his
every
muscle
of
his
thin
face
was
now
quivering
with
nervous
his
in
which
the
fire
of
life
had
seemed
now
flashed
with
brilliant
it
was
evident
that
the
more
lifeless
he
seemed
at
ordinary
the
more
impassioned
he
became
in
these
moments
of
almost
morbid
understand
why
i
say
he
it
is
the
whole
story
of
you
talk
of
bonaparte
and
his
said
he
pierre
had
not
mentioned
bonaparte
when
he
worked
went
step
by
step
toward
his
he
was
he
had
nothing
but
his
aim
to
and
he
reached
but
tie
yourself
up
with
a
woman
like
a
chained
you
lose
all
and
all
you
have
of
hope
and
strength
merely
weighs
you
down
and
torments
you
with
drawing
and
are
the
enchanted
circle
i
cannot
escape
i
am
now
going
to
the
the
greatest
war
there
ever
and
i
know
nothing
and
am
fit
for
i
am
very
amiable
and
have
a
caustic
continued
prince
at
anna
they
listen
to
and
that
stupid
set
without
whom
my
wife
cannot
and
those
if
you
only
knew
what
those
society
women
and
women
in
my
father
is
trivial
in
what
women
are
when
you
see
them
in
their
true
when
you
meet
them
in
society
it
seems
as
if
there
were
something
in
but
my
dear
concluded
prince
seems
funny
to
said
you
should
consider
yourself
incapable
and
your
life
a
spoiled
you
have
everything
before
and
he
did
not
finish
his
but
his
tone
showed
how
highly
he
thought
of
his
friend
and
how
much
he
expected
of
him
in
the
can
he
talk
like
thought
he
considered
his
friend
a
model
of
perfection
because
prince
andrew
possessed
in
the
highest
degree
just
the
very
qualities
pierre
and
which
might
be
best
described
as
strength
of
pierre
was
always
astonished
at
prince
calm
manner
of
treating
his
extraordinary
his
extensive
reading
had
read
knew
and
had
an
opinion
about
but
above
all
at
his
capacity
for
work
and
and
if
pierre
was
often
struck
by
lack
of
capacity
for
philosophical
meditation
which
he
himself
was
particularly
he
regarded
even
this
not
as
a
defect
but
as
a
sign
of
even
in
the
most
friendly
and
simplest
relations
of
praise
and
commendation
are
just
as
grease
is
necessary
to
wheels
that
they
may
run
part
is
played
said
prince
the
use
of
talking
about
let
us
talk
about
he
added
after
a
smiling
at
his
reassuring
that
smile
was
immediately
reflected
on
what
is
there
to
say
about
said
his
face
relaxing
into
a
merry
am
an
illegitimate
he
suddenly
blushed
and
it
was
plain
that
he
had
made
a
great
effort
to
say
a
name
and
without
and
it
but
he
did
not
say
what
the
present
i
am
free
and
am
all
only
i
the
least
idea
what
i
am
to
i
wanted
to
consult
you
prince
andrew
looked
kindly
at
yet
his
and
affectionate
as
it
a
sense
of
his
own
am
fond
of
especially
as
you
are
the
one
live
man
among
our
whole
all
choose
what
you
all
the
be
all
right
but
look
give
up
visiting
those
kuragins
and
leading
that
sort
of
it
suits
you
so
this
and
the
rest
of
would
you
my
dear
answered
shrugging
his
my
dear
understand
replied
prince
who
are
comme
il
a
different
but
the
set
of
and
i
pierre
was
staying
at
prince
vasili
and
sharing
the
dissipated
life
of
his
son
the
son
whom
they
were
planning
to
reform
by
marrying
him
to
prince
you
said
as
if
suddenly
struck
by
a
happy
i
have
long
been
thinking
of
leading
such
a
life
i
decide
or
think
properly
about
head
and
one
spends
all
he
asked
me
for
but
i
give
me
your
word
of
honor
not
to
my
chapter
ix
it
was
past
one
when
pierre
left
his
it
was
a
summer
pierre
took
an
open
cab
intending
to
drive
straight
but
the
nearer
he
drew
to
the
house
the
more
he
felt
the
impossibility
of
going
to
sleep
on
such
a
it
was
light
enough
to
see
a
long
way
in
the
deserted
street
and
it
seemed
more
like
morning
or
evening
than
on
the
way
pierre
remembered
that
anatole
kuragin
was
expecting
the
usual
set
for
cards
that
after
which
there
was
generally
a
drinking
finishing
with
visits
of
a
kind
pierre
was
very
fond
should
like
to
go
to
thought
but
he
immediately
recalled
his
promise
to
prince
andrew
not
to
go
as
happens
to
people
of
weak
he
desired
so
passionately
once
more
to
enjoy
that
dissipation
he
was
so
accustomed
to
that
he
decided
to
the
thought
immediately
occurred
to
him
that
his
promise
to
prince
andrew
was
of
no
because
before
he
gave
it
he
had
already
promised
prince
anatole
to
come
to
his
thought
such
of
are
conventional
things
with
no
definite
especially
if
one
considers
that
by
tomorrow
one
may
be
or
something
so
extraordinary
may
happen
to
one
that
honor
and
dishonor
will
be
all
the
pierre
often
indulged
in
reflections
of
this
nullifying
all
his
decisions
and
he
went
to
reaching
the
large
house
near
the
horse
in
which
anatole
pierre
entered
the
lighted
ascended
the
and
went
in
at
the
open
there
was
no
one
in
the
empty
and
overshoes
were
lying
there
was
a
smell
of
and
sounds
of
voices
and
shouting
in
the
cards
and
supper
were
but
the
visitors
had
not
yet
pierre
threw
off
his
cloak
and
entered
the
first
in
which
were
the
remains
of
a
thinking
no
one
saw
was
drinking
on
the
sly
what
was
left
in
the
from
the
third
room
came
sounds
of
the
shouting
of
familiar
the
growling
of
a
and
general
some
eight
or
nine
young
men
were
crowding
anxiously
round
an
open
three
others
were
romping
with
a
young
one
pulling
him
by
the
chain
and
trying
to
set
him
at
the
bet
a
hundred
on

no

or
he
shouted

the
a
handsome
fellow
who
stood
in
the
midst
of
the
without

and
with
his
fine
linen
shirt
unfastened
in
a
you
here
is
good
cried
addressing
another
from
a
man
of
medium
height
with
clear
blue
particularly
striking
among
all
these
drunken
voices
by
its
sober
cried
from
the
part
the
this
was
an
officer
of
the
semenov
a
notorious
gambler
and
who
was
living
with
pierre
looking
about
him
it
all
a
he
is
not
drunk
a
bottle
said
taking
a
glass
from
the
table
he
went
up
to
of
all
you
must
pierre
drank
one
glass
after
looking
from
under
his
brows
at
the
tipsy
guests
who
were
again
crowding
round
the
and
listening
to
their
anatole
kept
on
refilling
glass
while
explaining
that
dolokhov
was
betting
with
an
english
naval
that
he
would
drink
a
bottle
of
rum
sitting
on
the
outer
ledge
of
the
third
floor
window
with
his
legs
hanging
you
must
drink
it
said
giving
pierre
the
last
i
let
you

said
pushing
anatole
and
he
went
up
to
the
dolokhov
was
holding
the
hand
and
clearly
and
distinctly
repeating
the
terms
of
the
addressing
himself
particularly
to
anatole
and
dolokhov
was
of
medium
with
curly
hair
and
he
was
about
like
all
infantry
officers
he
wore
no
so
that
his
the
most
striking
feature
of
his
was
clearly
the
lines
of
that
mouth
were
remarkably
finely
the
middle
of
the
upper
lip
formed
a
sharp
wedge
and
closed
firmly
on
the
firm
lower
and
something
like
two
distinct
smiles
played
continually
round
the
two
corners
of
the
together
with
the
insolent
intelligence
of
his
produced
an
effect
which
made
it
impossible
not
to
notice
his
dolokhov
was
a
man
of
small
means
and
no
though
anatole
spent
tens
of
thousands
of
dolokhov
lived
with
him
and
had
placed
himself
on
such
a
footing
that
all
who
knew
including
anatole
respected
him
more
than
they
did
dolokhov
could
play
all
games
and
nearly
always
however
much
he
he
never
lost
his
both
kuragin
and
dolokhov
were
at
that
time
notorious

rakes

intimidated
by

of
the

his
swaggering
air

up

gave
no
indication
whether

not

he
kept
nodding
to

one
older
than

suddenly
pushed
forward
with
a
scared
and
angry
look
and

in

one
of
a

evidently
considered
it

to

an
interest
in
the
general
conversation
by

in
spite
of
herself
her
eyes
under
their
thick
long
lashes
watched
her
cousin
who
was
going
to
join
the
with
such
passionate
girlish
adoration
that
her
smile
could
not
for
a
single
instant
impose
upon
and
it
was
clear
that
the
kitten
had
settled
down
only
to
spring
up
with
more
energy
and
again
play
with
her
cousin
as
soon
as
they
too
like
natasha

glanced
at

kept
glancing

of
a

youth
at

the
young

little
feasting
her

down
nearer
to

with
a
coquettish
and
engaged
the
smiling
julie
in
a
confidential
conversation
without
at
all
noticing
that
his
involuntary
smile
had
stabbed
the
heart
of
who
blushed
and
smiled
in

of

glanced
round
at

left

waited
for
the
first
pause
in

with
a
distressed
face
left

their
hearts
on
their

as
if

no

which
was
always
in
her
how
much
how

anxiety
one
has
had
to
go
through
that
we
might
rejoice
in
them
and
yet
really
the
anxiety
is
greater
now
than
the
one

always
especially
just
at
this
so
dangerous

for

the
our
mothers

to
be

at
twelve

in

with

just
said
the
countess
with
a
gentle
looking
at
boris
and
went
evidently
concerned
with
a
thought
that
always
occupied
you
see
if
i
were
to
be
severe
with
her
and
to
forbid
goodness

had
a
pleasant
what
she
said

true
and
strange
to
visitors
and
countess
to
look
at
her
as
if
wondering
why
she
had
said
and
they
all
felt
are
always
too
clever
with
their
eldest
children
and
try
to
make
something
exceptional
of

called
to
a
footman
dressed
in

and
a

sprung
up

of

prince

came
a

with
a

on

dismissed
the
doctor
with
a
bow
and
approached
them
silently
and
with
a
look
of
the
son
noticed
that
an
expression
of
profound
sorrow
suddenly
clouded
his
and
he
smiled
in
what
sad
circumstances
we
meet
and
how
is
our
dear
said
as
though
unaware
of
the
cold
offensive
look
fixed
on

stared
at
her
and
at
boris
questioningly
and
boris
bowed
prince

without
acknowledging
the
bow
turned
to
anna
answering
her
query
by
a
movement
of
the
head
and
lips

very
little
hope
for

here
in

to
anna

he
had
placed
under
an

an

of
much
greater
importance
than
he
had
done
in

added
addressing
boris

neither

again
with

anna

answered
prince
vasili
in
his
monotonous
never
could
understand
how
nataly
made
up
her
mind
to
marry
that
unlicked
a
perfectly
absurd
and
stupid
and
a
gambler
i
am
a
very
kind
said
anna
mikhaylovna
with
a
pathetic
as
though
she
too
knew
that
count
rostov
deserved
this
but
asked
him
not
to
be
too
hard
on
the
poor
old
do
the
doctors
asked
the
princess
after
a
her
worn
face
again
expressing
deep

the

so
like
to

he
is

tone
suggesting
that
this
fact
ought
to
give
prince
vasili
much
prince
vasili
became
thoughtful
and
anna
mikhaylovna
saw
that
he
was
afraid
of
finding
in
her
a
rival
for
count
and
hastened
to
reassure
it
were
not
for
my
sincere
affection
and
devotion
to

uttering
the
word
with
peculiar
assurance
and
know
his
but
you
see
he
has
no
one
with
him
except
the
young
they
are
still
she
bent
her
head
and
continued
in
a

performed
his
final
how
priceless
are
those
last
it
can
make
things
no
and
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
prepare
him
if
he
is
so
we
and
she
smiled
know
how
to
say
these
i
absolutely
must
see
however
painful
it
may
be
for
i
am
used
to
evidently
the
prince
understood
and
also
as
he
had
done
at
anna
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
get
rid
of
anna
not
such
a
meeting
be
too
trying
for
dear
anna
said
us
wait
until
the
doctors
are

such

that

to
how

what
can

said
the
looking
at
anna

she
sympathetically
turned
up

the
princess
gave
no
reply
and
did
not

left
the
room
as
anna
mikhaylovna
took
off
her
gloves
occupying
the
position
she
had
settled
down
in
an
inviting

vasili
to
take

beside

had
now
been
for
some
days
in

was
staying
as
usual
at
his
though
he
expected
that
the
story
of
his
escapade
would
be
already
known
in
moscow

that
the
ladies
about
his
were

most
of
their

of
whom
were
sitting
at
embroidery

was
the
eldest

was
one
who
had
met
anna
the
two
younger
ones
were
both
were
rosy
and
pretty
and
they
differed
only
in
that
one
had
a
little
mole
on
her
lip
which
made
her
much

was
received
as
if
he
were
a
corpse
or
a

eldest

paused
in
her
reading
and
silently
stared
at
him
with
frightened
the
second
assumed
precisely
the
same
while
the
the
one
with
the
who
was
of
a
cheerful
and
lively
bent
over
her
frame
to
hide
a
smile
probably
evoked
by
the
amusing
scene
she
she
drew
her
wool
down
through
the
canvas
scarcely
able
to
refrain
from
stooped
as
if
trying
to
make
out
the
do
you
said
recognize
recognize
you
only
too
too
is
the
can
i
see
asked
awkwardly
as
but
count
is
suffering
physically
and
and
apparently
you
have
done
your
best
to
increase
his
mental
i
see
the
pierre
again
if
you
wish
to
kill
to
kill
him
you
can
see
go
and
see
whether
beef
tea
is

almost

giving
pierre
to
understand
that
they
were
and
busy
making
his
father
while
evidently
was
only
busy
causing
him
olga
went
pierre
stood
looking
at
the
then
he
bowed
and
i
will
go
to
my
you
will
let
me
know
when
i
can
see
and
he
left
the
followed
by
the
low
but
ringing
laughter
of
the
sister
with
the
next
day
prince
vasili
had
arrived
and
settled
in
the
he
sent
for
pierre
and
said
to
dear
if
you
are
going
to
behave
here
as
you
did
in
you
will
end
very
that
is
all
i
have
to
say
to
the
count
is
very
and
you
must
not
see
him
at
since
then
pierre
had
not
been
disturbed
and
had
spent
the
whole
time
in
his
rooms
when
boris
appeared
at
his
door
pierre
was
pacing
up
and
down
his
stopping
occasionally
at
a
corner
to
make
menacing
gestures
at
the
as
if
running
a
sword
through
an
invisible
and
glaring
savagely
over
his
and
then
again
resuming
his
muttering
indistinct
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
is
done
said
scowling
and
pointing
his
finger
at
someone
as
a
traitor
to
the
nation
and
to
the
rights
of
is
sentenced
but
before
at
that
moment
imagined
himself
to
be
napoleon
in
person
and
to
have
just
effected
the
dangerous
crossing
of
the
straits
of
dover
and
captured
pronounce
he
saw
a
and
handsome
young
officer
entering
his
pierre
he
had
left
moscow
when
boris
was
a
boy
of
and
had
quite
forgotten
but
in
his
usual
impulsive
and
hearty
way
he
took
boris
by
the
hand
with
a
friendly
you
remember
asked
boris
quietly
with
a
pleasant
have
come
with
my
mother
to
see
the
but
it
seems
he
is
not
it
seems
he
is
people
are
always
disturbing
answered
trying
to
remember
who
this
young
man
boris
felt
that
pierre
did
not
recognize
him
but
did
not
consider
it
necessary
to
introduce
and
without
experiencing
the
least
embarrassment
looked
pierre
straight
in
the
rostov
asks
you
to
come
to
dinner
said
after
a
considerable
pause
which
made
pierre
feel
count
exclaimed
pierre
you
are
his
only
i
know
you
at
do
you
remember
how
we
went
to
the
sparrow
hills
with
madame
such
an
are
said
boris
with
a
bold
and
slightly
sarcastic
am
son
of
princess
anna
mikhaylovna
the
is
and
his
son
is
i
never
knew
any
madame
pierre
shook
his
head
and
arms
as
if
attacked
by
mosquitoes
or
what
am
i
thinking
mixed
everything
one
has
so
many
relatives
in
so
you
are
of
now
we
know
where
we
and
what
do
you
think
of
the
boulogne
the
english
will
come
off
you
if
napoleon
gets
across
the
i
think
the
expedition
is
quite
if
only
villeneuve
make
a
mess
of
boris
knew
nothing
about
the
boulogne
he
did
not
read
the
papers
and
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
heard
here
in
moscow
are
more
occupied
with
dinner
parties
and
scandal
than
with
said
he
in
his
quiet
ironical
know
nothing
about
it
and
have
not
thought
about
moscow
is
chiefly
busy
with
he
now
they
are
talking
about
you
and
your
pierre
smiled
in
his
way
as
if
afraid
for
his
sake
that
the
latter
might
say
something
he
would
afterwards
but
boris
spoke
and
looking
straight
into
has
nothing
else
to
do
but
boris
went
is
wondering
to
whom
the
count
will
leave
his
though
he
may
perhaps
outlive
us
as
i
sincerely
hope
he
it
is
all
very
interrupted
pierre
was
still
afraid
that
this
officer
might
inadvertently
say
something
disconcerting
to
it
must
seem
to
said
boris
flushing
but
not
changing
his
tone
or
must
seem
to
you
that
everyone
is
trying
to
get
something
out
of
the
rich
it
thought
i
just
wish
to
to
avoid
that
you
are
quite
mistaken
if
you
reckon
me
or
my
mother
among
such
we
are
very
but
for
my
own
part
at
any
for
the
very
reason
that
your
father
is
i
regard
myself
as
a
relation
of
and
neither
i
nor
my
mother
would
ever
ask
or
take
anything
from
for
a
long
time
pierre
could
not
but
when
he
he
jumped
up
from
the
seized
boris
under
the
elbow
in
his
clumsy
blushing
far
more
than
began
to
speak
with
a
feeling
of
mingled
shame
and
this
is
do
you
suppose
who
could
i
know
very
but
boris
again
interrupted
am
glad
i
have
spoken
out
perhaps
you
did
not
like
you
must
excuse
said
putting
pierre
at
ease
instead
of
being
put
at
ease
by
i
hope
i
have
not
offended
i
always
make
it
a
rule
to
speak
what
answer
am
i
to
will
you
come
to
dinner
at
the
and
having
apparently
relieved
himself
of
an
onerous
duty
and
extricated
himself
from
an
awkward
situation
and
placed
another
in
became
quite
pleasant
but
i
said
calming
are
a
wonderful
what
you
have
just
said
is
very
of
course
you
know
we
have
not
met
for
such
a
long
not
since
we
were
you
might
think
that
i
quite
i
could
not
have
done
it
i
should
not
have
had
the
but
i
am
very
glad
to
have
made
your

added
after
a
you
should
have
suspected
he
began
to
what
of
i
hope
get
better
and
he
pressed
you
i
have
not
once
been
in
to
see
the
he
has
not
sent
for
i
am
sorry
for
him
as
a
but
what
can
one
so
you
think
napoleon
will
manage
to
get
an
army
asked
boris
with
a
pierre
saw
that
boris
wished
to
change
the
and
being
of
the
same
mind
he
began
explaining
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
the
boulogne
a
footman
came
in
to
summon
princess

in
order
to
make
better
promised
to
come
to
and
warmly
pressing
his
hand
looked
affectionately
over
his
spectacles
into
after
he
had
gone
pierre
continued
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
for
a
long
no
longer
piercing
an
imaginary
foe
with
his
imaginary
but
smiling
at
the
remembrance
of
that
and
resolute
young
as
often
happens
in
early
especially
to
one
who
leads
a
lonely
he
felt
an
unaccountable
tenderness
for
this
young
man
and
made
up
his
mind
that
they
would
be
prince
vasili
saw
the
princess
she
held
a
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
and
her
face
was

she
was
cost
me
what
it
may
i
shall
do
my
i
will
come
and
spend
the
he
must
not
be
left
like
every
moment
is
i
think
why
his
nieces
put

perhaps
god
will
help
me
to
find
a
way
to
prepare
may
god
support

answered
prince
vasili
turning
away
from
he
is
in
a
dreadful
said
the
mother
to
her
son
when
they
were
in
the
hardly
recognizes
is
his
attitude
to
asked
the
will
will
show
my
our
fate
also
depends
on
why
do
you
expect

wanted

simply
from

julie
by

request
played
after

had
played
a
little

on

in
begging

and
who
were
noted
for
their
musical
to

at

where

she
looked
round

seeing
that
her
friend
was
not

ran
to
look
for
running
into

and
not
finding
her
natasha
ran
to
the
but
sonya
was
not
there
natasha
concluded
that
she
must
be
on
the

the
chest
in
the
passage
was
the
place
of
mourning
for
the
younger
female

there
in

was
sonya
lying
face
downward
on
dirty
feather
bed
on
the
top
of
the
crumpling
her
gauzy
pink
dress
under
hiding
her
face
with
her
slender
and
sobbing
so
convulsively
that
her
bare
little
shoulders
which
had
been
so
radiantly
happy
all
that
suddenly
her
eyes
became
and
then
a
shiver
passed
down
her
broad
neck
and
the
corners
of
her
mouth
what
is
what
is
the
and
large
mouth
making
her
look
quite
and
she
began
to
wail
like
a
baby
without
knowing
except
that
sonya
was
sonya
tried
to
lift
her
head
to
answer
but
could
and
hid
her
face
still
deeper
in
the
natasha
sitting
on
the
feather
bed
and
hugging
her
with
an
effort
sonya
sat
up
and
began
wiping
her
eyes
and

in
a

began
consoling
but
her
face
showed
that
she
understood

clung
to
her
and
tucking
away
the
verses
in
the
bosom
of
her
dress
close
to
her
bony
little
ran
after
natasha
down
the
passage
into
the
sitting
room
with
flushed
face
and
joyous
at
the
request
the
young
people
sang
the
with
which
everyone
was
then
nicholas
sang
a
song
he
had
just
at
nighttime
in
the
fair
glow
how
as
fancies
wander
to
feel
that
in
this
world
one
who
still
is
thinking
but
of
that
while
her
fingers
touch
the
harp
wafting
sweet
music

it
is
for
thee
thus
swells
her
sighing
its
message
out
to
a
day
or
then
bliss
but
till

had
not
finished
the
last
verse
before
the
young
people
began
to
get
ready
to
dance

and
the
sound
of
the
feet
and
the
coughing
of

were
heard
from

sitting
in
the
where
shinshin
had
engaged
as
a

recently
returned
from

a
political
conversation
in
which
several
others
joined
but
which
bored
when
the
music
began
natasha
came
in
and
walking
straight
up
to
pierre
laughing
and
told
me
to
ask
you
to

afraid
of
mixing
the
pierre
if
you
will
be
my
and
lowering
his
big
arm
he
offered
it
to
the
slender
little
while
the
couples
were
arranging
themselves
and
the

conspicuous
place
and
talking
to
him
like
a
she
had
a
fan
in
her
hand
that
one
of
the
ladies
had
given
her
to
assuming
quite
the
pose
of
a
society
woman
knows
when
and
where
she
had
learned
she
talked
with
her
fanning
herself
and
smiling

and
why
should

there
to
be
surprised
in
the
midst
of
the
third
ecossaise
there
was
a
clatter
of
chairs
being
pushed
back
in
the
sitting
room
where
the
count
and
marya
dmitrievna
had
been
playing
cards
with
the
majority
of
the
more
distinguished
and
older

stretching
themselves
after

and
replacing
their
purses
and
entered

and
the
both
with
merry

in
ballet
offered
his
bent
arm
to
marya
he
drew
himself
a
smile
of
debonair
gallantry
lit
up
his
face
and
as
soon
as
the
last
figure
of
the
ecossaise
was

clapped
his
hands
to
the
musicians
and
shouted
up
to

quite
forgetting
that
she
was
dancing
with
a
partner
she
bent
her
curly
head
to
her
knees
and
made
the
whole
room
ring
with
her
and
indeed
everybody
in
the
room
looked
with
a
smile
of
pleasure
at
the
jovial

standing
beside

and
stout

gently
with
his

a
smile
that
broadened
his
round
face
more
and
prepared
the
onlookers
for
what
was
to
as
soon
as
the
provocatively
gay

of

those
of

handed
her
reticule
to

really
joined
in

what
was
expressed
by

whole
of

no

appreciated

at

and
state

meanwhile
prince
vasili
had
opened
the
door
into
the
in
this
room
it
was
almost
only
two
tiny
lamps
were
burning
before
the
icons
and
there
was
a
pleasant
scent
of
flowers
and
burnt
the
room
was
crowded
with
small
pieces
of
and
little
the
quilt
of
a
white
feather
bed
was
just
visible
behind
a
a
small
dog
began
to
is
it
she
rose
and
smoothed
her
which
was
as
usual
so
extremely
smooth
that
it
seemed
to
be
made
of
one
piece
with
her
head
and
covered
with
anything
she
am
so
there
is
no
i
only
came
to
have
a
talk
about

the
seating
himself
wearily
on
the
chair
she
had
just
have
made
the
place
i
must
he
sit
have
a
thought
perhaps
something
had
she
said
with
her
unchanging
stonily
severe
sitting
down
opposite
the
she
prepared
to
wished
to
get
a
mon
but
i
my
said
prince
taking
her
hand
and
bending
it
downwards
as
was
his
it
was
plain
that
this
referred
to
much
that
they
both
understood
without
the
who
had
a
rigid
abnormally
long
for
her
looked
directly
at
prince
vasili
with
no
sign
of
emotion
in
her
prominent
gray
then
she
shook
her
head
and
glanced
up
at
the
icons
with
a
this
might
have
been
taken
as
an
expression
of
sorrow
and
or
of
weariness
and
hope
of
resting
before
prince
vasili
understood
it
as
an
expression
of
he
you
think
it
is
easier
for
i
am
as
worn
out
as
a
post
but
still
i
must
have
a
talk
with
a
very
serious
prince
vasili
said
no
more
and
his
cheeks
began
to
twitch
now
on
one
now
on
the
giving
his
face
an
unpleasant
expression
which
was
never
to
be
seen
on
it
in
a
drawing
his
eyes
too
seemed
at
one
moment
they
looked
impudently
sly
and
at
the
next
glanced
round
in
the
holding
her
little
dog
on
her
lap
with
her
thin
bony
looked
attentively
into
prince
eyes
evidently
resolved
not
to
be
the
first
to
break
if
she
had
to
wait
till
you
my
dear
princess
and
catherine
continued
prince
returning
to
his
apparently
not
without
an
inner
such
a
moment
as
this
one
must
think
of
one
must
think
of
the
of
all
of
i
love
you
like
children
of
my
as
you
the
princess
continued
to
look
at
him
without
and
with
the
same
dull
then
of
course
my
family
has
also
to
be
prince
vasili
went
testily
pushing
away
a
little
table
without
looking
at
that
three
and
my
are
the
only
direct
i
i
know
how
hard
it
is
for
you
to
talk
or
think
of
such
it
is
no
easier
for
my
i
am
getting
on
for
sixty
and
must
be
prepared
for
do
you
know
i
have
sent
for
the
pointing
to
his
demanded
that
he
should
be
prince
vasili
looked
questioningly
at
the
but
could
not
make
out
whether
she
was
considering
what
he
had
just
said
or
whether
she
was
simply
looking
at
is
one
thing
i
constantly
pray
god
to
mon
she
it
is
that
he
would
be
merciful
to
him
and
would
allow
his
noble
soul
peacefully
to
leave
of
interrupted
prince
vasili
rubbing
his
bald
head
and
angrily
pulling
back
toward
him
the
little
table
that
he
had
pushed
in
the
fact
you
know
yourself
that
last
winter
the
count
made
a
will
by
which
he
left
all
his
not
to
us
his
direct
but
to
has
made
wills
quietly
remarked
the
he
cannot
leave
the
estate
to
pierre
is
my
said
prince
vasili
clutching
the
little
table
and
becoming
more
animated
and
talking
more
if
a
letter
has
been
written
to
the
emperor
in
which
the
count
asks
for
do
you
understand
that
in
consideration
of
the
his
request
would
be
the
princess
smiled
as
people
do
who
think
they
know
more
about
the
subject
under
discussion
than
those
they
are
talking
can
tell
you
continued
prince
seizing
her
letter
was
though
it
was
not
and
the
emperor
knew
of
the
only
question
has
it
been
destroyed
or
if
then
as
soon
as
all
is
and
prince
vasili
sighed
to
intimate
what
he
meant
by
the
words
all
is
the
papers
are
the
will
and
letter
will
be
delivered
to
the
and
the
petition
will
certainly
be
pierre
will
get
everything
as
the
legitimate
our
asked
the
princess
smiling
as
if
anything
might
only
not
my
poor
it
is
as
clear
as
he
will
then
be
the
legal
heir
to
everything
and
you
get
you
must
my
whether
the
will
and
letter
were
and
whether
they
have
been
destroyed
or
and
if
they
have
somehow
been
you
ought
to
know
where
they
and
must
find
the
princess
smiling
sardonically
and
not
changing
the
expression
of
her
am
a
and
you
think
we
are
all
but
i
know
an
illegitimate
son
cannot
un
she
as
if
supposing
that
this
translation
of
the
word
would
effectively
prove
to
prince
vasili
the
invalidity
of
his
a
you
you
are
so
how
is
it
you
see
that
if
the
count
has
written
a
letter
to
the
emperor
begging
him
to
recognize
pierre
as
it
follows
that
pierre
will
not
be
pierre
but
will
become
count
and
will
then
inherit
everything
under
the
and
if
the
will
and
letter
are
not
then
you
will
have
nothing
but
the
consolation
of
having
been
dutiful
et
tout
ce
qui
and
all
that
follows
know
the
will
was
but
i
also
know
that
it
is
and
mon
seem
to
consider
me
a
perfect
said
the
princess
with
the
expression
women
assume
when
they
suppose
they
are
saying
something
witty
and
dear
princess
catherine
began
prince
vasili
came
here
not
to
wrangle
with
but
to
talk
about
your
interests
as
with
a
a
true
and
i
tell
you
for
the
tenth
time
that
if
the
letter
to
the
emperor
and
the
will
in
favor
are
among
the
my
dear
you
and
your
sisters
are
not
if
you
believe
then
believe
an
i
have
just
been
talking
to
dmitri
family
he
says
the
at
this
a
sudden
change
evidently
took
place
in
the
her
thin
lips
grew
though
her
eyes
did
not
and
her
voice
when
she
began
to
speak
passed
through
such
transitions
as
she
herself
evidently
did
not
would
be
a
fine
said
never
wanted
anything
and
i
she
pushed
the
little
dog
off
her
lap
and
smoothed
her
this
is
is
recognition
for
those
who
have
sacrificed
everything
for
his

you
are
not
the
only
there

the
princess

ago

about

the
count
quite
ill
and

her
a
piece
of
my
the
time
will
chapter
xxii
while
these
conversations
were
going
on
in
the
reception
room
and
the
a
carriage
containing
pierre
had
been
sent
and
anna
mikhaylovna
found
it
necessary
to
accompany
was
driving
into
the
court
of
count
as
the
wheels
rolled
softly
over
the
straw
beneath
the
anna
having
turned
with
words
of
comfort
to
her
realized
that
he
was
asleep
in
his
corner
and
woke
him
rousing
pierre
followed
anna
mikhaylovna
out
of
the
and
only
then
began
to
think
of
the
interview
with
his
dying
father
which
awaited
he
noticed
that
they
had
not
come
to
the
front
entrance
but
to
the
back
while
he
was
getting
down
from
the
carriage
steps
two
who
looked
like
ran
hurriedly
from
the
entrance
and
hid
in
the
shadow
of
the
pausing
for
a
pierre
noticed
several
other
men
of
the
same
kind
hiding
in
the
shadow
of
the
house
on
both
but
neither
anna
mikhaylovna
nor
the
footman
nor
the
who
could
not
help
seeing
these
took
any
notice
of
seems
to
be
all
pierre
and
followed
anna
she
hurriedly
ascended
the
narrow
dimly
lit
stone
calling
to
who
was
lagging
to
though
he
did
not
see
why
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
go
to
the
count
at
still
less
why
he
had
to
go
by
the
back
yet
judging
by
anna
air
of
assurance
and
pierre
concluded
that
it
was
all
absolutely
halfway
up
the
stairs
they
were
almost
knocked
over
by
some
men
carrying
came
running
their
boots
these
men
pressed
close
to
the
wall
to
let
pierre
and
anna
mikhaylovna
pass
and
did
not
evince
the
least
surprise
at
seeing
them
this
the
way
to
the
asked
anna
mikhaylovna
of
one
of
replied
a
footman
in
a
bold
loud
as
if
anything
were
now
door
to
the
the
count
did
not
ask
for
said
pierre
when
he
reached
the
better
go
to
my
own
anna
mikhaylovna
paused
and
waited
for
him
to
come
my
she
touching
his
arm
as
she
had
done
her
when
speaking
to
him
that
me
i
suffer
no
less
than
you
but
be
a
i
better
go
he
looking
kindly
at
her
over
his
my
dear
forget
the
wrongs
that
may
have
been
done
think
that
he
is
your
perhaps
in
the
agony
of
she
have
loved
you
like
a
son
from
the
trust
yourself
to
i
shall
not
forget
your
pierre
did
not
understand
a
but
the
conviction
that
all
this
had
to
be
grew
and
he
meekly
followed
anna
mikhaylovna
who
was
already
opening
a
this
door
led
into
a
back
an
old
a
servant
of
the
sat
in
a
corner
knitting
a
pierre
had
never
been
in
this
part
of
the
house
and
did
not
even
know
of
the
existence
of
these
anna
addressing
a
maid
who
was
hurrying
past
with
a
decanter
on
a
tray
as
and
asked
about
the
health
and
then
led
pierre
along
a
stone
the
first
door
on
the
left
led
into
the
the
maid
with
the
decanter
in
her
haste
had
not
closed
the
door
in
the
house
was
done
in
haste
at
that
and
pierre
and
anna
mikhaylovna
in
passing
instinctively
glanced
into
the
where
prince
vasili
and
the
eldest
princess
were
sitting
close
together
seeing
them
prince
vasili
drew
back
with
obvious
while
the
princess
jumped
up
and
with
a
gesture
of
desperation
slammed
the
door
with
all
her
this
action
was
so
unlike
her
usual
composure
and
the
fear
depicted
on
prince
face
so
out
of
keeping
with
his
dignity
that
pierre
stopped
and
glanced
inquiringly
over
his
spectacles
at
his
anna
mikhaylovna
evinced
no
she
only
smiled
faintly
and
as
if
to
say
that
this
was
no
more
than
she
had
a
my
i
will
look
after
your
said
she
in
reply
to
his
and
went
still
faster
along
the
pierre
could
not
make
out
what
it
was
all
and
still
less
what
over
his
but
he
decided
that
all
these
things
had
to
from
the
passage
they
went
into
a
dimly
lit
room
adjoining
the
reception
it
was
one
of
those
sumptuous
but
cold
apartments
known
to
pierre
only
from
the
front
but
even
in
this
room
there
now
stood
an
empty
and
water
had
been
spilled
on
the
they
were
met
by
a
deacon
with
a
censer
and
by
a
servant
who
passed
out
on
tiptoe
without
heeding
they
went
into
the
reception
room
familiar
to
with
two
italian
windows
opening
into
the
with
its
large
bust
and
full
length
portrait
of
catherine
the
the
same
people
were
still
sitting
here
in
almost
the
same
positions
as
whispering
to
one
all
became
silent
and
turned
to
look
at
the
pale
anna
mikhaylovna
as
she
and
at
the
big
stout
figure
of
pierre
hanging
his
meekly
followed
anna
face
expressed
a
consciousness
that
the
decisive
moment
had
with
the
air
of
a
practical
petersburg
lady
she
keeping
pierre
close
beside
entered
the
room
even
more
boldly
than
that
she
felt
that
as
she
brought
with
her
the
person
the
dying
man
wished
to
her
own
admission
was
casting
a
rapid
glance
at
all
those
in
the
room
and
noticing
the
confessor
she
glided
up
to
him
with
a
sort
of
not
exactly
bowing
yet
seeming
to
grow
suddenly
and
respectfully
received
the
blessing
first
of
one
and
then
of
another
be
thanked
that
you
are
in
said
she
to
one
of
the
we
relatives
have
been
in
such
this
young
man
is
the
she
added
more
a
terrible
having
said
this
she
went
up
to
the
said
young
man
is
the
is
there
any
the
doctor
cast
a
rapid
glance
upwards
and
silently
shrugged
his
anna
mikhaylovna
with
just
the
same
movement
raised
her
shoulders
and
almost
closing
the
and
moved
away
from
the
doctor
to
to
in
a
particularly
respectful
and
tenderly
sad
she
in
his
and
pointing
out
a
small
sofa
for
him
to
sit
and
wait
for
she
went
silently
toward
the
door
that
everyone
was
watching
and
it
creaked
very
slightly
as
she
disappeared
behind
having
made
up
his
mind
to
obey
his
monitress
moved
toward
the
sofa
she
had
as
soon
as
anna
mikhaylovna
had
disappeared
he
noticed
that
the
eyes
of
all
in
the
room
turned
to
him
with
something
more
than
curiosity
and
he
noticed
that
they
whispered
to
one
casting
significant
looks
at
him
with
a
kind
of
awe
and
even
a
deference
such
as
he
had
never
before
received
was
shown
a
strange
the
one
who
had
been
talking
to
the
rose
and
offered
him
her
an
picked
up
and
returned
a
glove
pierre
had
the
doctors
became
respectfully
silent
as
he
passed
and
moved
to
make
way
for
at
first
pierre
wished
to
take
another
seat
so
as
not
to
trouble
the
and
also
to
pick
up
the
glove
himself
and
to
pass
round
the
doctors
who
were
not
even
in
his
but
all
at
once
he
felt
that
this
would
not
and
that
tonight
he
was
a
person
obliged
to
perform
some
sort
of
awful
rite
which
everyone
expected
of
and
that
he
was
therefore
bound
to
accept
their
he
took
the
glove
in
silence
from
the
and
sat
down
in
the
placing
his
huge
hands
symmetrically
on
his
knees
in
the
naive
attitude
of
an
egyptian
and
decided
in
his
own
mind
that
all
was
as
it
should
and
that
in
order
not
to
lose
his
head
and
do
foolish
things
he
must
not
act
on
his
own
ideas
but
must
yield
himself
up
entirely
to
the
will
of
those
who
were
guiding
not
two
minutes
had
passed
before
prince
vasili
with
head
erect
majestically
entered
the
he
was
wearing
his
long
coat
with
three
stars
on
his
he
seemed
to
have
grown
thinner
since
the
his
eyes
seemed
larger
than
usual
when
he
glanced
round
and
noticed
he
went
up
to
took
his
hand
thing
he
never
used
to
and
drew
it
downwards
as
if
wishing
to
ascertain
whether
it
was
firmly
fixed
my
he
has
asked
to
see
that
is
and
he
turned
to
but
pierre
thought
it
necessary
to
and
not
knowing
whether
it
would
be
proper
to
call
the
dying
man
yet
ashamed
to
call
him
had
another
stroke
about
half
an
hour
my
mind
was
in
such
a
confused
state
that
the
word
suggested
to
him
a
blow
from
he
looked
at
prince
vasili
in
and
only
later
grasped
that
a
stroke
was
an
attack
of
prince
vasili
said
something
to
lorrain
in
passing
and
went
through
the
door
on
he
could
not
walk
well
on
tiptoe
and
his
whole
body
jerked
at
each
the
eldest
princess
followed
and
the
priests
and
deacons
and
some
servants
also
went
in
at
the
through
that
door
was
heard
a
noise
of
things
being
moved
and
at
last
anna
still
with
the
same
pale
but
resolute
in
the
discharge
of
ran
out
and
touching
pierre
lightly
on
the
arm
divine
mercy

unction

about
to
be
pierre
went
in
at
the
stepping
on
the
soft
and
noticed
that
the
strange
the
and
some
of
the
all
followed
him
as
if
there
were
now
no
further
need
for
permission
to
enter

a
long
invalid

in

freshly

to
the

by
a
bright
green
majestic
figure
of
his
count
with
that
gray
mane
of

above
his
broad
forehead
which
reminded
one
of
a

the
deep
characteristically
noble
wrinkles
of
his

lay
just
under

younger
princesses

handkerchiefs
to

just
in

of
them
their
eldest

a
vicious
and
determined
look
steadily
fixed
on

leaning
his
left
arm
on
the
carved
back
of
a
velvet
chair
he
had
turned
round
for
the
and
was
crossing
himself
with
his

turning
his
eyes
upward
each
time
he
touched

face

a
calm
look
of
piety
and
resignation

seemed
to
be
much
the
worse
for
behind
him
stood
the

and
the
the
men
and
women
had
separated
as
in
all
were
silently
crossing
and
the
reading
of
the
church
the
subdued
chanting
of
deep
bass
and
in
the
intervals
sighs
and
the
shuffling
of
feet
were
the
only
sounds
that
could
be

an
air
of
importance
that
showed
that
she

she
quite
knew
what
she
was

across
the
room
to
where
pierre
was
standing
and
gave
him

lit

by
observing
those
around
began
crossing
himself
with
the
hand
that
held
the
the
youngest
princess
with
the
watched
she
hid
her
face
in
her
and
remained
with
it
hidden
for
then
looking
up
and
seeing
pierre
she
again
began
to
she
evidently
felt
unable
to
look
at
him
without
but
could
not
resist
looking
at
so
to
be
out
of
temptation
she
slipped
quietly
behind
one
of
the
in
the
midst
of
the
service
the
voices
of
the
priests
suddenly
they
whispered
to
one
and
the
old
servant
who
was
holding
the
hand
got
up
and
said
something
to
the
anna
mikhaylovna
stepped
forward
stooping
over
the
dying
beckoned
to
lorrain
from
behind
her
the
french
doctor
held
no
he
was
leaning
against
one
of
the
columns
in
a
respectful
attitude
implying
that
a
in
spite
of
all
differences
of
understood
the
full
importance
of
the
rite
now
being
performed
and
even
approved
of
he
now
approached
the
sick
man
with
the
noiseless
step
of
one
in
full
vigor
of
with
his
delicate
white
fingers
raised
from
the
green
quilt
the
hand
that
was
and
turning
sideways
felt
the
pulse
and
reflected
a
the
sick
man
was
given
something
to
there
was
a
stir
around
then
the
people
resumed
their
places
and
the
service
during
this
interval
pierre
noticed
that
prince
vasili
left
the
chair
on
which
he
had
been
an
air
which
intimated
that
he
knew
what
he
was
about
and
if
others
did
not
understand
him
it
was
so
much
the
worse
for
not
go
up
to
the
dying
but
passed
by
joined
the
eldest
and
moved
with
her
to
the
side
of
the
room
where
stood
the
high
bedstead
with
its
silken
on
leaving
the
bed
both
prince
vasili
and
the
princess
passed
out
by
a
back
but
returned
to
their
places
one
after
the
other
before
the
service
was
pierre
paid
no
more
attention
to
this
occurrence
than
to
the
rest
of
what
went
having
made
up
his
mind
once
for
all
that
what
he
saw
happening
around
him
that
evening
was
in
some
way
the
chanting
of
the
service
and
the
voice
of
the
priest
was
heard
respectfully
congratulating
the
dying
man
on
having
received
the
the
dying
man
lay
as
lifeless
and
immovable
as
around
him
everyone
began
to
steps
were
audible
and
among
which
anna
was
the
most
pierre
heard
her
he
must
be
moved
onto
the
here
it
will
be
the
sick
man
was
so
surrounded
by
and
servants
that
pierre
could
no
longer
see
the
face
with
its
gray
though
he
saw
other
faces
as
he
had
not
lost
sight
of
for
a
single
moment
during
the
whole
he
judged
by
the
cautious
movements
of
those
who
crowded
round
the
invalid
chair
that
they
had
lifted
the
dying
man
and
were
moving
hold
of
my
arm
or
drop
he
heard
one
of
the
servants
say
in
a
frightened
hold
from
exclaimed
different
and
the
heavy
breathing
of
the
bearers
and
the
shuffling
of
their
feet
grew
more
as
if
the
weight
they
were
carrying
were
too
much
for
as
the
among
whom
was
anna
passed
the
young
man
he
caught
a
momentary
glimpse
between
their
heads
and
backs
of
the
dying
uncovered
chest
and
powerful
raised
by
those
who
were
holding
him
under
the
and
of
his
leonine
this
with
its
remarkably
broad
brow
and
its
sensual
and
its
majestic
was
not
disfigured
by
the
approach
of
it
was
the
same
as
pierre
remembered
it
three
months
when
the
count
had
sent
him
to
but
now
this
head
was
swaying
helplessly
with
the
uneven
movements
of
the
and
the
cold
listless
gaze
fixed
itself
upon
after
a
few
bustle
beside
the
high
those
who
had
carried
the
sick
man
anna
mikhaylovna
touched
hand
and
pierre
went
with
her
to
the
bed
on
which
the
sick
man
had
been
laid
in
a
stately
pose
in
keeping
with
the
ceremony
just
he
lay
with
his
head
propped
high
on
the
his
hands
were
symmetrically
placed
on
the
green
silk
the
palms
when
pierre
came
up
the
count
was
gazing
straight
at
but
with
a
look
the
significance
of
which
could
not
be
understood
by
mortal
either
this
look
meant
nothing
but
that
as
long
as
one
has
eyes
they
must
look
or
it
meant
too
pierre
not
knowing
what
to
and
glanced
inquiringly
at
his
anna
mikhaylovna
made
a
hurried
sign
with
her
glancing
at
the
sick
hand
and
moving
her
lips
as
if
to
send
it
a
carefully
stretching
his
neck
so
as
not
to
touch
the
followed
her
suggestion
and
pressed
his
lips
to
the
large
fleshy
neither
the
hand
nor
a
single
muscle
of
the
face
once
more
pierre
looked
questioningly
at
anna
mikhaylovna
to
see
what
he
was
to
do
anna
mikhaylovna
with
her
eyes
indicated
a
chair
that
stood
beside
the
pierre
obediently
sat
his
eyes
asking
if
he
were
doing
anna
mikhaylovna
nodded
again
pierre
fell
into
the
naively
symmetrical
pose
of
an
egyptian
evidently
distressed
that
his
stout
and
clumsy
body
took
up
so
much
room
and
doing
his
utmost
to
look
as
small
as
he
looked
at
the
who
still
gazed
at
the
spot
where
face
had
been
before
he
sat
anna
mikhaylovna
indicated
by
her
attitude
her
consciousness
of
the
pathetic
importance
of
these
last
moments
of
meeting
between
the
father
and
this
lasted
about
two
which
to
pierre
seemed
an
suddenly
the
broad
muscles
and
lines
of
the
face
began
to
the
twitching
the
handsome
mouth
was
drawn
to
one
side
now
did
pierre
realize
how
near
death
his
father
and
from
that
distorted
mouth
issued
an
hoarse
anna
mikhaylovna
looked
attentively
at
the
sick
trying
to
guess
what
he
she
pointed
first
to
then
to
some
then
named
prince
vasili
in
an
inquiring
then
pointed
to
the
the
eyes
and
face
of
the
sick
man
showed
he
made
an
effort
to
look
at
the
servant
who
stood
constantly
at
the
head
of
the
to
turn
on
the
other
whispered
the
and
got
up
to
turn
the
heavy
body
toward
the
pierre
rose
to
help
while
the
count
was
being
turned
one
of
his
arms
fell
back
helplessly
and
he
made
a
fruitless
effort
to
pull
it
whether
he
noticed
the
look
of
terror
with
which
pierre
regarded
that
lifeless
or
whether
some
other
thought
flitted
across
his
dying
at
any
rate
he
glanced
at
the
refractory
at
and
again
at
the
and
on
his
face
a
piteous
smile
quite
out
of
keeping
with
his
that
seemed
to
deride
his
own
at
sight
of
this
smile
pierre
felt
an
unexpected
quivering
in
his
breast
and
a
tickling
in
his
and
tears
dimmed
his
the
sick
man
was
turned
on
to
his
side
with
his
face
to
the
he
is
said
anna
observing
that
one
of
the
princesses
was
coming
to
take
her
turn
at
us
pierre
went
chapter
xxiv
there
was
now
no
one
in
the
reception
room
except
prince
vasili
and
the
eldest
who
were
sitting
under
the
portrait
of
catherine
the
great
and
talking
as
soon
as
they
saw
pierre
and
his
companion
they
became
and
pierre
thought
he
saw
the
princess
hide
something
as
she
bear
the
sight
of
that
has
had
tea
served
in
the
small
drawing
said
prince
vasili
to
anna
and
take
my
poor
anna
or
you
will
not
hold
to
pierre
he
said
merely
giving
his
arm
a
sympathetic
squeeze
below
the
pierre
went
with
anna
mikhaylovna
into
the
small
drawing
is
nothing
so
refreshing
after
a
sleepless
night
as
a
cup
of
this
delicious
russian
lorrain
was
saying
with
an
air
of
restrained
animation
as
he
stood
sipping
tea
from
a
delicate
chinese
handleless
cup
before
a
table
on
which
tea
and
a
cold
supper
were
laid
in
the
small
circular
around
the
table
all
who
were
at
count
house
that
night
had
gathered
to
fortify
pierre
well
remembered
this
small
circular
drawing
room
with
its
mirrors
and
little
during
balls
given
at
the
house
who
did
not
know
how
to
had
liked
sitting
in
this
room
to
watch
the
ladies
as
they
passed
through
in
their
ball
dresses
with
diamonds
and
pearls
on
their
bare
looked
at
themselves
in
the
brilliantly
lighted
mirrors
which
repeated
their
reflections
several
now
this
same
room
was
dimly
lighted
by
two
on
one
small
table
tea
things
and
supper
dishes
stood
in
and
in
the
middle
of
the
night
a
motley
throng
of
people
sat
not
but
somberly
and
betraying
by
every
word
and
movement
that
they
none
of
them
forgot
what
was
happening
and
what
was
about
to
happen
in
the
pierre
did
not
eat
anything
though
he
would
very
much
have
liked
he
looked
inquiringly
at
his
monitress
and
saw
that
she
was
again
going
on
tiptoe
to
the
reception
room
where
they
had
left
prince
vasili
and
the
eldest
pierre
concluded
that
this
also
was
and
after
a
short
interval
followed
anna
mikhaylovna
was
standing
beside
the
and
they
were
both
speaking
in
excited
to
know
what
is
necessary
and
what
is
not
said
the
younger
of
the
two
evidently
in
the
same
state
of
excitement
as
when
she
had
slammed
the
door
of
her
my
dear
answered
anna
mikhaylovna
blandly
but
blocking
the
way
to
the
bedroom
and
preventing
the
other
from
this
be
too
much
for
poor
uncle
at
a
moment
when
he
needs
worldly
conversation
at
a
moment
when
his
soul
is
already
prince
vasili
was
seated
in
an
easy
chair
in
his
familiar
with
one
leg
crossed
high
above
the
his
which
were
so
flabby
that
they
looked
heavier
were
twitching
but
he
wore
the
air
of
a
man
little
concerned
in
what
the
two
ladies
were
my
dear
anna
let
catiche
do
as
she
you
know
how
fond
the
count
is
of
even
know
what
is
in
this
said
the
younger
of
the
two
addressing
prince
vasili
and
pointing
to
an
inlaid
portfolio
she
held
in
her
i
know
is
that
his
real
will
is
in
his
writing
and
this
is
a
paper
he
has
she
tried
to
pass
anna
but
the
latter
sprang
so
as
to
bar
her
my
kind
said
anna
seizing
the
portfolio
so
firmly
that
it
was
plain
she
would
not
let
go
i
beg
and
implore

some
pity
on
je
vous
en
the
princess
did
not
their
efforts
in
the
struggle
for
the
portfolio
were
the
only
sounds
but
it
was
evident
that
if
the
princess
did
her
words
would
not
be
flattering
to
anna
though
the
latter
held
on
her
voice
lost
none
of
its
honeyed
firmness
and
my
come
i
think
he
will
not
be
out
of
place
in
a
family
is
it
not
you
suddenly
shrieked
the
princess
so
loud
that
those
in
the
drawing
room
heard
her
and
were
do
you
remain
silent
when
heaven
knows
who
permits
herself
to
making
a
scene
on
the
very
threshold
of
a
dying
she
hissed
and
tugged
with
all
her
might
at
the
but
anna
mikhaylovna
went
forward
a
step
or
two
to
keep
her
hold
on
the
and
changed
her
prince
vasili
said
he
with
reproach
and
is

anna
such
a
solemn
allow
him
a
tell
them
your
said
turning
to
the
young
man
having
come
quite
was
gazing
with
astonishment
at
the
angry
face
of
the
princess
which
had
lost
all
and
at
the
twitching
cheeks
of
prince
that
you
will
answer
for
the
said
prince
vasili
know
what
you
are
shouted
the
darting
unexpectedly
at
anna
mikhaylovna
and
snatching
the
portfolio
from
prince
vasili
bent
his
head
and
spread
out
his
at
this
moment
that
terrible
which
pierre
had
watched
so
long
and
which
had
always
opened
so
burst
noisily
open
and
banged
against
the

the
second
of
the
three
sisters
rushed
out
wringing

cried

you
leave
me
alone
with
her
sister

anna
quickly
caught
up
the
object
of
contention
and
ran
into
the
the
eldest
princess
and
prince
recovering
followed
a
few
minutes
later
the
eldest
sister
came
out
with
a
pale
hard
again
biting
her
at
sight
of
pierre
her
expression
showed
an
irrepressible
now
you
may
be
said
is
what
you
have
been
waiting
and
bursting
into
tears
she
hid
her
face
in
her
handkerchief
and
rushed
from
the
prince
vasili
came
he
staggered
to
the
sofa
on
which
pierre
was
sitting
and
dropped
onto
covering
his
face
with
his
pierre
noticed
that
he
was
pale
and
that
his
jaw
quivered
and
shook
as
if
in
an
my
said
taking
pierre
by
the
and
there
was
in
his
voice
a
sincerity
and
weakness

how
much

and
all

approached

with
quiet
she
pierre
gave
her
an
inquiring
she
kissed
the
young
man
on
his
wetting
him
with
her
then
after
a
pause
she
is
no
pierre
looked
at
her
over
his
i
will
go
with
try
to
nothing
gives
such
relief
as
she
led
him
into
the
dark
drawing
room
and
pierre
was
glad
no
one
could
see
his
anna
mikhaylovna
left
and
when
she
returned
he
was
fast
asleep
with
his
head
on
his
in
the
morning
anna
mikhaylovna
said
to
my
this
is
a
great
loss

in
command
of
an
immense

to
be
sure
that

not
turn

imposes
duties
on

you
must
be

later
on
i
may
tell
my
dear

if

had
not
been
god

what
would
have
you

my
dear
you
will
carry
out
your
pierre
understood
nothing
of
all
this
and
coloring
shyly
looked
in
silence
at
princess
anna
after
her
talk
with
anna
mikhaylovna
returned
to
the
and
went
to
on
waking
in
the
morning
she
told
the
rostovs
and
all
her
acquaintances
the
details
of
count
she
said
the
count
had
died
as
she
would
herself
wish
to
that
his
end
was
not
only
touching
but
as
to
the
last
meeting
between
father
and
it
was
so
touching
that
she
could
not
think
of
it
without
and
did
not
know
which
had
behaved
better
during
those
awful
father
who
so
remembered
everything
and
everybody
at
last
and
had
spoken
such
pathetic
words
to
the
or
whom
it
had
been
pitiful
to
so
stricken
was
he
with
though
he
tried
hard
to
hide
it
in
order
not
to
sadden
his
dying
is
but
it
does
one
it
uplifts
the
soul
to
see
such
men
as
the
old
count
and
his
worthy
said
of
the
behavior
of
the
eldest
princess
and
prince
vasili
she
spoke
but
in
whispers
and
as
a
great
chapter
xxv
at
bald
prince
nicholas
andreevich
the
arrival
of
young
prince
andrew
and
his
wife
was
daily
but
this
expectation
did
not
upset
the
regular
routine
of
life
in
the
old
general
in
chief
prince
nicholas
andreevich
in
king
of
ever
since
the
emperor
paul
had
exiled
him
to
his
country
estate
had
lived
there
continuously
with
his
princess
and
her
mademoiselle
though
in
the
new
reign
he
was
free
to
return
to
the
he
still
continued
to
live
in
the
remarking
that
anyone
who
wanted
to
see
him
could
come
the
hundred
miles
from
moscow
to
bald
while
he
himself
needed
no
one
and
he
used
to
say
that
there
are
only
two
sources
of
human
and
and
only
two
and
he
himself
undertook
his
and
to
develop
these
two
cardinal
virtues
in
her
gave
her
lessons
in
algebra
and
geometry
till
she
was
and
arranged
her
life
so
that
her
whole
time
was
he
was
himself
always
writing
his
solving
problems
in
higher
turning
snuffboxes
on
a
working
in
the
or
superintending
the
building
that
was
always
going
on
at
his
as
regularity
is
a
prime
condition
facilitating
regularity
in
his
household
was
carried
to
the
highest
point
of
he
always
came
to
table
under
precisely
the
same
and
not
only
at
the
same
hour
but
at
the
same
with
those
about
from
his
daughter
to
his
the
prince
was
sharp
and
invariably
so
that
without
being
a
hardhearted
man
he
inspired
such
fear
and
respect
as
few
hardhearted
men
would
have
although
he
was
in
retirement
and
had
now
no
influence
in
political
every
high
official
appointed
to
the
province
in
which
the
estate
lay
considered
it
his
duty
to
visit
him
and
waited
in
the
lofty
antechamber
just
as
the
or
princess
mary
till
the
prince
appeared
punctually
to
the
appointed
everyone
sitting
in
this
antechamber
experienced
the
same
feeling
of
respect
and
even
fear
when
the
enormously
high
study
door
opened
and
showed
the
figure
of
a
rather
small
old
with
powdered
small
withered
and
bushy
gray
eyebrows
when
he
sometimes
hid
the
gleam
of
his
youthfully
glittering
on
the
morning
of
the
day
that
the
young
couple
were
to
princess
mary
entered
the
antechamber
as
usual
at
the
time
appointed
for
the
morning
crossing
herself
with
trepidation
and
repeating
a
silent
every
morning
she
came
in
like
and
every
morning
prayed
that
the
daily
interview
might
pass
off
an
old
powdered
manservant
who
was
sitting
in
the
antechamber
rose
quietly
and
said
in
a
walk
through
the
door
came
the
regular
hum
of
a
the
princess
timidly
opened
the
door
which
moved
noiselessly
and
she
paused
at
the
the
prince
was
working
at
the
lathe
and
after
glancing
round
continued
his
the
enormous
study
was
full
of
things
evidently
in
constant
the
large
table
covered
with
books
and
the
tall
bookcases
with
keys
in
the
the
high
desk
for
writing
while
standing
on
which
lay
an
open
exercise
and
the
lathe
with
tools
laid
ready
to
hand
and
shavings
scattered
indicated
and
orderly
the
motion
of
the
small
foot
shod
in
a
tartar
boot
embroidered
with
and
the
firm
pressure
of
the
lean
sinewy
showed
that
the
prince
still
possessed
the
tenacious
endurance
and
vigor
of
hardy
old
after
a
few
more
turns
of
the
lathe
he
removed
his
foot
from
the
wiped
his
dropped
it
into
a
leather
pouch
attached
to
the
approaching
the
summoned
his
he
never
gave
his
children
a
so
he
simply
held
out
his
bristly
cheek
yet
regarding
her
tenderly
and
said
all
right
sit
he
took
the
exercise
book
containing
lessons
in
geometry
written
by
himself
and
drew
up
a
chair
with
his
said
quickly
finding
the
page
and
making
a
scratch
from
one
paragraph
to
another
with
his
hard
the
princess
bent
over
the
exercise
book
on
the
a
a
letter
for
said
the
old
man
taking
a
letter
addressed
in
a
hand
from
a
bag
hanging
above
the
onto
which
he
threw
at
the
sight
of
the
letter
red
patches
showed
themselves
on
the
she
took
it
quickly
and
bent
her
head
over
asked
the
prince
with
a
cold
smile
that
showed
his
still
yellowish
from
replied
the
princess
with
a
timid
glance
and
a
timid
let
two
more
letters
but
the
third
said
the
prince
afraid
you
write
much
read
the
this
if
you
said
the
blushing
still
more
and
holding
out
the
i
said
the
cried
the
prince
pushing
the
letter
and
leaning
his
elbows
on
the
table
he
drew
toward
him
the
exercise
book
containing
geometrical
he
stooping
over
the
book
close
to
his
daughter
and
placing
an
arm
on
the
back
of
the
chair
on
which
she
so
that
she
felt
herself
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
the
acrid
scent
of
old
age
and
which
she
had
known
so
these
triangles
are
please
note
that
the
angle
the
princess
looked
in
a
scared
way
at
her
eyes
glittering
close
to
the
red
patches
on
her
face
came
and
and
it
was
plain
that
she
understood
nothing
and
was
so
frightened
that
her
fear
would
prevent
her
understanding
any
of
her
further
however
clear
they
might
whether
it
was
the
fault
or
the
this
same
thing
happened
every
the
eyes
grew
she
could
not
see
and
could
not
hear
but
was
only
conscious
of
her
stern
withered
face
close
to
of
his
breath
and
the
smell
of
and
could
think
only
of
how
to
get
away
quickly
to
her
own
room
to
make
out
the
problem
in
the
old
man
was
beside
moved
the
chair
on
which
he
was
sitting
noisily
backward
and
made
efforts
to
control
himself
and
not
become
but
almost
always
did
become
and
sometimes
flung
the
exercise
book
the
princess
gave
a
wrong
she
a
shouted
the
pushing
the
book
aside
and
turning
sharply
but
rising
he
paced
up
and
lightly
touched
his
hair
and
sat
down
he
drew
up
his
and
continued
to
it
said
when
princess
having
taken
and
closed
the
exercise
book
with
the
next
was
about
to
are
most
i
want
to
have
you
like
our
silly
get
used
to
it
and
like
and
he
patted
her
will
drive
all
the
nonsense
out
of
your
she
turned
to
but
he
stopped
her
with
a
gesture
and
took
an
uncut
book
from
the
high
is
some
sort
of
key
to
the
mysteries
that
your
heloise
has
sent
i
interfere
with
i
have
looked
at
take
now
he
patted
her
on
the
shoulder
and
himself
closed
the
door
after
princess
mary
went
back
to
her
room
with
the
scared
expression
that
rarely
left
her
and
which
made
her
sickly
face
yet
she
sat
down
at
her
writing
on
which
stood
miniature
portraits
and
which
was
littered
with
books
and
the
princess
was
as
untidy
as
her
father
was
she
put
down
the
geometry
book
and
eagerly
broke
the
seal
of
her
it
was
from
her
most
intimate
friend
from
that
same
julie
karagina
who
had
been
at
the
day
julie
wrote
in
dear
and
precious
how
terrible
and
frightful
a
thing
is
though
i
tell
myself
that
half
my
life
and
half
my
happiness
are
wrapped
up
in
and
that
in
spite
of
the
distance
separating
us
our
hearts
are
united
by
indissoluble
my
heart
rebels
against
fate
and
in
spite
of
the
pleasures
and
distractions
around
me
i
cannot
overcome
a
certain
secret
sorrow
that
has
been
in
my
heart
ever
since
we
why
are
we
not
together
as
we
were
last
in
your
big
on
the
blue
the
confidential
why
cannot
i
as
three
months
draw
fresh
moral
strength
from
your
so
and
a
look
i
loved
so
well
and
seem
to
see
before
me
as
i
having
read
thus
princess
mary
sighed
and
glanced
into
the
mirror
which
stood
on
her
it
reflected
a
ungraceful
figure
and
thin
her
always
now
looked
with
particular
hopelessness
at
her
reflection
in
the
flatters
thought
the
turning
away
and
continuing
to
but
julie
did
not
flatter
her
the
deep
and
luminous
seemed
as
if
at
times
there
radiated
from
them
shafts
of
warm
so
beautiful
that
very
often
in
spite
of
the
plainness
of
her
face
they
gave
her
an
attraction
more
powerful
than
that
of
but
the
princess
never
saw
the
beautiful
expression
of
her
own
look
they
had
when
she
was
not
thinking
of
as
with
her
face
assumed
a
forced
unnatural
expression
as
soon
as
she
looked
in
a
she
went
on
all
moscow
talks
of
nothing
but
one
of
my
two
brothers
is
already
the
other
is
with
the
who
are
starting
on
their
march
to
the
our
dear
emperor
has
left
petersburg
and
it
is
thought
intends
to
expose
his
precious
person
to
the
chances
of
god
grant
that
the
corsican
monster
who
is
destroying
the
peace
of
europe
may
be
overthrown
by
the
angel
whom
it
has
pleased
the
in
his
to
give
us
as
to
say
nothing
of
my
this
war
has
deprived
me
of
one
of
the
associations
nearest
my
i
mean
young
nicholas
who
with
his
enthusiasm
could
not
bear
to
remain
inactive
and
has
left
the
university
to
join
the
i
will
confess
to
dear
that
in
spite
of
his
extreme
youth
his
departure
for
the
army
was
a
great
grief
to
this
young
of
whom
i
spoke
to
you
last
is
so
and
full
of
that
real
youthfulness
which
one
seldom
finds
nowadays
among
our
old
men
of
twenty
he
is
so
frank
and
has
so
much
he
is
so
pure
and
poetic
that
my
relations
with
transient
as
they
have
been
one
of
the
sweetest
comforts
to
my
poor
which
has
already
suffered
so
someday
i
will
tell
you
about
our
parting
and
all
that
was
said
that
is
still
too
dear
you
are
happy
not
to
know
these
poignant
joys
and
you
are
for
the
latter
are
generally
the
i
know
very
well
that
count
nicholas
is
too
young
ever
to
be
more
to
me
than
a
but
this
sweet
this
poetic
and
pure
were
what
my
heart
but
enough
of
the
chief
about
which
all
moscow
is
the
death
of
old
count
and
his
the
three
princesses
have
received
very
prince
vasili
and
it
is
monsieur
pierre
who
has
inherited
all
the
property
and
has
besides
been
recognized
as
so
that
he
is
now
count
bezukhov
and
possessor
of
the
finest
fortune
in
it
is
rumored
that
prince
vasili
played
a
very
despicable
part
in
this
affair
and
that
he
returned
to
petersburg
quite
i
confess
i
understand
very
little
about
all
these
matters
of
wills
and
but
i
do
know
that
since
this
young
whom
we
all
used
to
know
as
plain
monsieur
has
become
count
bezukhov
and
the
owner
of
one
of
the
largest
fortunes
in
i
am
much
amused
to
watch
the
change
in
the
tone
and
manners
of
the
mammas
burdened
by
marriageable
and
of
the
young
ladies
toward
between
you
and
he
always
seemed
to
me
a
poor
sort
of
as
for
the
past
two
years
people
have
amused
themselves
by
finding
husbands
for
me
of
whom
i
even
the
matchmaking
chronicles
of
moscow
now
speak
of
me
as
the
future
countess
but
you
will
understand
that
i
have
no
desire
for
the
a
propos
of
do
you
know
that
a
while
ago
that
universal
auntie
anna
mikhaylovna
told
under
the
seal
of
strict
of
a
plan
of
marriage
for
it
is
neither
more
nor
less
than
with
prince
son
whom
they
wish
to
reform
by
marrying
him
to
someone
rich
and
and
it
is
on
you
that
his
choice
has
i
know
what
you
will
think
of
but
i
consider
it
my
duty
to
let
you
know
of
he
is
said
to
be
very
handsome
and
a
terrible
that
is
all
i
have
been
able
to
find
out
about
but
enough
of
i
am
at
the
end
of
my
second
sheet
of
and
mamma
has
sent
for
me
to
go
and
dine
at
the
read
the
mystical
book
i
am
sending
it
has
an
enormous
success
though
there
are
things
in
it
difficult
for
the
feeble
human
mind
to
it
is
an
admirable
book
which
calms
and
elevates
the
give
my
respects
to
monsieur
your
father
and
my
compliments
to
mademoiselle
i
embrace
you
as
i
love
julie
let
me
have
news
of
your
brother
and
his
charming
little
the
princess
pondered
awhile
with
a
thoughtful
smile
and
her
luminous
eyes
lit
up
so
that
her
face
was
entirely
then
she
suddenly
rose
and
with
her
heavy
tread
went
up
to
the
she
took
a
sheet
of
paper
and
her
hand
moved
rapidly
over
this
is
the
reply
she
also
in
dear
and
precious
your
letter
of
the
13th
has
given
me
great
so
you
still
love
my
romantic
of
which
you
say
so
much
that
is
does
not
seem
to
have
had
its
usual
effect
on
you
complain
of
our
what
then
should
i
if
i
dared
i
who
am
deprived
of
all
who
are
dear
to
if
we
had
not
religion
to
console
us
life
would
be
very
why
do
you
suppose
that
i
should
look
severely
on
your
affection
for
that
young
on
such
matters
i
am
only
severe
with
i
understand
such
feelings
in
and
if
never
having
felt
them
i
cannot
approve
of
neither
do
i
condemn
only
it
seems
to
me
that
christian
love
of
love
of
is
and
better
than
the
feelings
which
the
beautiful
eyes
of
a
young
man
can
inspire
in
a
romantic
and
loving
young
girl
like
the
news
of
count
death
reached
us
before
your
letter
and
my
father
was
much
affected
by
he
says
the
count
was
the
last
representative
but
one
of
the
great
and
that
it
is
his
own
turn
but
that
he
will
do
all
he
can
to
let
his
turn
come
as
late
as
god
preserve
us
from
that
terrible
i
cannot
agree
with
you
about
whom
i
knew
as
a
he
always
seemed
to
me
to
have
an
excellent
and
that
is
the
quality
i
value
most
in
as
to
his
inheritance
and
the
part
played
by
prince
it
is
very
sad
for
my
dear
our
divine
that
it
is
easier
for
a
camel
to
go
through
the
eye
of
a
needle
than
for
a
rich
man
to
enter
the
kingdom
of
are
terribly
i
pity
prince
vasili
but
am
still
more
sorry
for
so
and
burdened
with
such
what
temptations
he
will
be
if
i
were
asked
what
i
desire
most
on
it
would
be
to
be
poorer
than
the
poorest
a
thousand
dear
for
the
volume
you
have
sent
me
and
which
has
such
success
in
yet
since
you
tell
me
that
among
some
good
things
it
contains
others
which
our
weak
human
understanding
cannot
it
seems
to
me
rather
useless
to
spend
time
in
reading
what
is
unintelligible
and
can
therefore
bear
no
i
never
could
understand
the
fondness
some
people
have
for
confusing
their
minds
by
dwelling
on
mystical
books
that
merely
awaken
their
doubts
and
excite
their
giving
them
a
bent
for
exaggeration
quite
contrary
to
christian
let
us
rather
read
the
epistles
and
let
us
not
seek
to
penetrate
what
mysteries
they
for
how
can
miserable
sinners
that
we
know
the
terrible
and
holy
secrets
of
providence
while
we
remain
in
this
flesh
which
forms
an
impenetrable
veil
between
us
and
the
let
us
rather
confine
ourselves
to
studying
those
sublime
rules
which
our
divine
saviour
has
left
for
our
guidance
here
let
us
try
to
conform
to
them
and
follow
and
let
us
be
persuaded
that
the
less
we
let
our
feeble
human
minds
the
better
we
shall
please
who
rejects
all
knowledge
that
does
not
come
from
and
the
less
we
seek
to
fathom
what
he
has
been
pleased
to
conceal
from
the
sooner
will
he
vouchsafe
its
revelation
to
us
through
his
divine
my
father
has
not
spoken
to
me
of
a
but
has
only
told
me
that
he
has
received
a
letter
and
is
expecting
a
visit
from
prince
in
regard
to
this
project
of
marriage
for
i
will
tell
dear
sweet
that
i
look
on
marriage
as
a
divine
institution
to
which
we
must
however
painful
it
may
be
to
should
the
almighty
lay
the
duties
of
wife
and
mother
upon
me
i
shall
try
to
perform
them
as
faithfully
as
i
without
disquieting
myself
by
examining
my
feelings
toward
him
whom
he
may
give
me
for
i
have
had
a
letter
from
my
who
announces
his
speedy
arrival
at
bald
hills
with
his
this
pleasure
will
be
but
a
brief
for
he
will
leave
us
again
to
take
part
in
this
unhappy
war
into
which
we
have
been
god
knows
how
or
not
only
where
you
the
heart
of
affairs
and
of
the
the
talk
all
of
even
here
amid
fieldwork
and
the
calm
of
townsfolk
consider
characteristic
of
the
of
war
are
heard
and
painfully
my
father
talks
of
nothing
but
marches
and
things
of
which
i
understand
and
the
day
before
yesterday
during
my
daily
walk
through
the
village
i
witnessed
a
heartrending
it
was
a
convoy
of
conscripts
enrolled
from
our
people
and
starting
to
join
the
you
should
have
seen
the
state
of
the
and
children
of
the
men
who
were
going
and
should
have
heard
the
it
seems
as
though
mankind
has
forgotten
the
laws
of
its
divine
who
preached
love
and
forgiveness
of
and
that
men
attribute
the
greatest
merit
to
skill
in
killing
one
dear
and
kind
may
our
divine
saviour
and
his
most
holy
mother
keep
you
in
their
holy
and
mary
you
are
sending
off
a
i
have
already
dispatched
i
have
written
to
my
poor
said
the
smiling
mademoiselle
bourienne
in
her
pleasant
mellow
tones
and
with
guttural
she
brought
into
princess
and
gloomy
world
a
quite
different
and
i
must
warn
she
lowering
her
voice
and
evidently
listening
to
herself
with
and
speaking
with
exaggerated
prince
has
been
scolding
michael
he
is
in
a
very
bad
very
be
dear
replied
princess
have
asked
you
never
to
warn
me
of
the
humor
my
father
is
i
do
not
allow
myself
to
judge
him
and
would
not
have
others
do
the
princess
glanced
at
her
watch
seeing
that
she
was
five
minutes
late
in
starting
her
practice
on
the
went
into
the
sitting
room
with
a
look
of
between
twelve
and
two
as
the
day
was
mapped
the
prince
rested
and
the
princess
played
the
chapter
xxvi
the
valet
was
sitting
drowsily
listening
to
the
snoring
of
the
who
was
in
his
large
from
the
far
side
of
the
house
through
the
closed
doors
came
the
sound
of
difficult
times
a
sonata
by
just
then
a
closed
carriage
and
another
with
a
hood
drove
up
to
the
prince
andrew
got
out
of
the
helped
his
little
wife
to
and
let
her
pass
into
the
house
before
old
wearing
a
put
his
head
out
of
the
door
of
the
reported
in
a
whisper
that
the
prince
was
and
hastily
closed
the
tikhon
knew
that
neither
the
arrival
nor
any
other
unusual
event
must
be
allowed
to
disturb
the
appointed
order
of
the
prince
andrew
apparently
knew
this
as
well
as
he
looked
at
his
watch
as
if
to
ascertain
whether
his
habits
had
changed
since
he
was
at
home
having
assured
himself
that
they
had
he
turned
to
his
will
get
up
in
twenty
let
us
go
across
to
he
the
little
princess
had
grown
stouter
during
this
but
her
eyes
and
her
smiling
lip
lifted
when
she
began
to
speak
just
as
merrily
and
prettily
as
this
is
a
she
said
to
her
looking
around
with
the
expression
with
which
people
compliment
their
host
at
a
and
with
a
glance
she
smiled
at
at
her
and
at
the
footman
who
accompanied
that
mary
go
quietly
and
take
her
by
prince
andrew
followed
her
with
a
courteous
but
sad
grown
he
said
in
passing
to
the
old
who
kissed
his
before
they
reached
the
room
from
which
the
sounds
of
the
clavichord
the
fair
haired
mademoiselle
rushed
out
apparently
beside
herself
with
what
joy
for
the
exclaimed
i
must
let
her
please
you
are
mademoiselle
said
the
little
kissing
know
you
already
through
my
friendship
for
she
was
not
expecting
they
went
up
to
the
door
of
the
sitting
room
from
which
came
the
sound
of
the
passage
of
the
prince
andrew
stopped
and
made
a
as
if
expecting
something
the
little
princess
entered
the
the
passage
broke
off
in
the
a
cry
was
then
princess
heavy
tread
and
the
sound
of
when
prince
andrew
went
in
the
two
who
had
only
met
once
before
for
a
short
time
at
his
were
in
each
arms
warmly
pressing
their
lips
to
whatever
place
they
happened
to
mademoiselle
bourienne
stood
near
them
pressing
her
hand
to
her
with
a
beatific
smile
and
obviously
equally
ready
to
cry
or
to
prince
andrew
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
as
lovers
of
music
do
when
they
hear
a
false
the
two
women
let
go
of
one
and
as
if
afraid
of
being
too
seized
each
kissing
them
and
pulling
them
and
again
began
kissing
each
other
on
the
and
then
to
prince
surprise
both
began
to
cry
and
kissed
mademoiselle
bourienne
also
began
to
prince
andrew
evidently
felt
ill
at
but
to
the
two
women
it
seemed
quite
natural
that
they
should
and
apparently
it
never
entered
their
heads
that
it
could
have
been
otherwise
at
this
my
they
suddenly
and
then
dreamed
last
were
not
expecting
you
have
got
you
have
grown

the
princess
at
put
in
mademoiselle
i
had
no
exclaimed
princess
i
did
not
see
prince
andrew
and
his
hand
in
kissed
one
and
he
told
her
she
was
still
the
same
crybaby
as
princess
mary
had
turned
toward
her
and
through
her
tears
the
gentle
look
of
her
large
luminous
very
beautiful
at
that
rested
on
prince
the
little
princess
talked
her
downy
upper
lip
continually
and
rapidly
touching
her
rosy
nether
lip
when
necessary
and
drawing
up
again
next
moment
when
her
face
broke
into
a
smile
of
glittering
teeth
and
sparkling
she
told
of
an
accident
they
had
had
on
the
spasski
hill
which
might
have
been
serious
for
her
in
her
and
immediately
after
that
informed
them
that
she
had
left
all
her
clothes
in
petersburg
and
that
heaven
knew
what
she
would
have
to
dress
in
and
that
andrew
had
quite
and
that
kitty
odyntsova
had
married
an
old
and
that
there
was
a
suitor
for
a
real
but
that
they
would
talk
of
that
princess
mary
was
still
looking
silently
at
her
brother
and
her
beautiful
eyes
were
full
of
love
and
it
was
plain
that
she
was
following
a
train
of
thought
independent
of
her
in
the
midst
of
a
description
of
the
last
petersburg
fete
she
addressed
her
you
are
really
going
to
the

said

and
even
replied

leaving
me
god
knows
when
he
might
have
had
princess
mary
did
not
listen
to
the
but
continuing
her
train
of
thought
turned
to
her
with
a
tender
glance
at
her
it
she
the
face
of
the
little
princess
she
sighed
and
quite
it
is
very
her
lip
she
brought
her
face
close
to
her
and
unexpectedly
again
began
to
needs
said
prince
andrew
with
a
take
her
to
your
room
and
go
to
how
is
just
the

asked
prince
andrew
with
a
scarcely
perceptible
smile
which
showed
in
spite
of
all
his
love
and
respect
for
his
he
was
aware
of
his
hours
are
the
and
the
and
also
the
mathematics
and
my
geometry
said
princess
mary
as
if
her
lessons
in
geometry
were
among
the
greatest
delights
of
her

the
twenty
minutes
had
elapsed
and
the
time

come
for
the
old
prince

apartments
while
he
dressed
for
the
old
prince

dressed
in
wearing
an
antique
coat
and
powdered

when
prince
andrew
entered
his
dressing
room
with
the
contemptuous
look
and
manner
he
wore
in
drawing

with
the
animated
face
with
which
he
talked
to

old

not

the

interest
during
this
but
as
if
he
were
not
listening
to
it
continued
to
dress
while
walking
and
three
times
unexpectedly
once
he
stopped
it
by

entered
the
dining
room
where
his
princess
and
mademoiselle
bourienne
were
already
awaiting
him
together
with
his
who
by
a
strange
caprice
of
his
was
admitted
to
table
though
the
position
of
that
insignificant
individual
was
such
as
could
certainly
not
have
caused
him
to
expect
that
the
who
generally
kept
very
strictly
to
social
distinctions
and
rarely
admitted
even
important
government
officials
to

unexpectedly
selected

into
a
corner
to
blow
his
nose
on
his
checked
to
illustrate
the
theory
that
all
men
are

had
more
than
once
impressed
on
his
daughter
that
michael
ivanovich
was
a
whit
worse
than
you
or
at
dinner
the
prince
usually
spoke
to
the
taciturn
michael
ivanovich
more
often
than
to
anyone
in

which
like
all
the
rooms
in

scanning
the

anxiously
glancing
from
the
clock
to
the
door
by
which
the
prince
was
to
prince
andrew
was
looking
at
a
large
gilt
new
to
containing
the
genealogical
tree
of
the
princes
opposite
which
hung
another
such
frame
with
a
badly
painted
portrait
by
the
hand
of
the
artist
belonging
to
the
of
a
ruling
in
a
alleged
descendant
of
rurik

ancestor
of
the
prince
looking
again
at
that
genealogical
shook
his
laughing
as
a
man
laughs
who
looks
at
a
portrait
so
characteristic
of
the
original
as
to
be
thoroughly
like

that

had

at
her

did

her
with
reverence

was
beyond

continued
prince

his
powerful
indulging
in
such
princess
mary
could
not
understand
the
boldness
of
her
criticism
and
was
about
to
when
the
expected
footsteps
were
heard
coming
from
the
the
prince
walked
in
quickly
and
jauntily
as
was
his
as
if
intentionally
contrasting
the
briskness
of
his
manners
with
the
strict
formality
of
his
at
that
moment
the
great
clock
struck
two
and
another
with
a
shrill
tone
joined
in
from
the
drawing
the
prince
stood
his
lively
glittering
eyes
from
under
their
bushy
eyebrows
sternly
scanned
all
present
and
rested
on
the
little
she
as
courtiers
do
when
the
tsar
the
sensation
of
fear
and
respect
which
the
old
man
inspired
in
all
around
he
stroked
her
hair
and
then
patted
her
awkwardly
on
the
back
of
her
to
see
he
looking
attentively
into
her
and
then
quickly
went
to
his
place
and
sat

indicated
a
place
beside
him
to
his

footman

the
old
casting
his
eyes
on
her
rounded
been
in

laughed
in
his
usual
unpleasant
with
his
lips
only
and
not
with
his

walk
as
much
as
as
much
as
he
the
little
princess
did
or
did
not
wish
hear
his
she
was
silent
and
seemed
the
prince
asked
her
about
her
and
she
began
to
smile
and
he
asked
about
mutual
and
she
became
still
more
animated
and
chattered
away
giving
him
greetings
from
various
people
and
retelling
the
town
poor
has
lost
her
husband
and
she
has
cried
her
eyes
she
growing
more
and
more
as
she
became
animated
the
prince
looked
at
her
more
and
more
and
as
if
he
had
studied
her
sufficiently
and
had
formed
a
definite
idea
of
he
turned
away
and
addressed
michael
michael
our
bonaparte
will
be
having
a
bad
time
of
prince
always
spoke
thus
of
his
been
telling
me
what
forces
are
being
collected
against
while
you
and
i
never
thought
much
of
michael
ivanovich
did
not
at
all
know
when
and
had
said
such
things
about
but
understanding
that
he
was
wanted
as
a
peg
on
which
to
hang
the
favorite
he
looked
inquiringly
at
the
young
wondering
what
would
is
a
great
said
the
prince
to
his
pointing
to
the
and
the
conversation
again
turned
on
the
on
and
the
generals
and
statesmen
of
the
the
old
prince
seemed
convinced
not
only
that
all
the
men
of
the
day
were
mere
babies
who
did
not
know
the
a
b
c
of
war
or
of
and
that
bonaparte
was
an
insignificant
little
successful
only
because
there
were
no
longer
any
potemkins
or
suvorovs
left
to
oppose
but
he
was
also
convinced
that
there
were
no
political
difficulties
in
europe
and
no
real
but
only
a
sort
of
puppet
show
at
which
the
men
of
the
day
were
pretending
to
do
something
prince
andrew
gaily
bore
with
his
ridicule
of
the
new
and
drew
him
on
and
listened
to
him
with
evident
past
always
seems
said
did
not
suvorov
himself
fall
into
a
trap
moreau
set
and
from
which
he
did
not
know
how
to
told
you
cried
the
and
he
jerked
away
his
which
tikhon
briskly
prince
frederick
and
moreau
would
have
been
a
prisoner
if
suvorov
had
had
a
free

he
had
the

his
it
would
have
puzzled
the
devil
when
you
get
there
find
out
what
those
suvorov
manage
them
so
what
chance
has
michael
my
dear

said
prince
am
only
surprised
at
your
opinion
of
you
may
laugh
as
much
as
you
but
all
the
same

great

the
old

with
a
silver
spoon

since
the
world
began
everybody
has
beaten
the
they
beat
no
one
he
made
his
reputation
fighting
and
the
prince
began
explaining
all
the
blunders
according
to
bonaparte
had
made
in
his
campaigns
and
even
in
his
son
made
no
but
it
was
evident
that
whatever
arguments
were
presented
he
was
as
little
able
as
his
father
to
change
his
he
refraining
from
a
and
involuntarily
wondered
how
this
old

alone

the
country

so

minutely
and
acutely
all

excellent
i

the
prince
out

with
a
laugh
still
more
he
quitted
the
the
little
princess
during
the
whole
discussion
and
the
rest
of
the
dinner
sat
glancing
with
a
frightened
look
now
at
her
law
and
now
at
princess
when
they
left
the
table
she
took
her
arm
and
drew
her
into

prince
andrew
was
to
leave
next
the
old
not
altering
his
retired
as
usual
after
the
little
princess
was
in
her
prince
andrew
in
a
traveling
coat
without
epaulettes
had
been
packing
with
his
valet
in
the
rooms
assigned
to
after
inspecting
the
carriage
himself
and
seeing
the
trunks
put
he
ordered
the
horses
to
be
only
those
things
he
always
kept
with
him
remained
in
his
a
small
a
large
canteen
fitted
with
silver
two
turkish
pistols
and
a
present
from
his
father
who
had
brought
it
from
the
siege
of
all
these
traveling
effects
of
prince
were
in
very
good
and
in
cloth
covers
carefully
tied
with
when
starting
on
a
journey
or
changing
their
mode
of
men
capable
of
reflection
are
generally
in
a
serious
frame
of
at
such
moments
one
reviews
the
past
and
plans
for
the
prince
face
looked
very
thoughtful
and
with
his
hands
behind
him
he
paced
briskly
from
corner
to
corner
of
the
looking
straight
before
him
and
thoughtfully
shaking
his
did
he
fear
going
to
the
or
was
he
sad
at
leaving
his
but
evidently
he
did
not
wish
to
be
seen
in
that
for
hearing
footsteps
in
the
passage
he
hurriedly
unclasped
his
stopped
at
a
table
as
if
tying
the
cover
of
the
small
and
assumed
his
usual
tranquil
and
impenetrable
it
was
the
heavy
tread
of
princess
mary
that
he
hear
you
have
given
orders
to
she
panting
had
apparently
been
i
did
so
wish
to
have
another
talk
with
you
god
knows
how
long
we
may
again
be
you
are
not
angry
with
me
for
you
have
changed
she
as
if
to
explain
such
a
she
smiled
as
she
uttered
his
pet
it
was
obviously
strange
to
her
to
think
that
this
stern
handsome
man
should
be
slender
mischievous
boy
who
had
been
her
playfellow
in
where
is
he
answering
her
question
only
by
a
was
so
tired
that
she
has
fallen
asleep
on
the
sofa
in
my
what
a
treasure
of
a
wife
you
said
sitting
down
on
the
facing
her
is
quite
a
such
a
merry
i
have
grown
so
fond
of
prince
andrew
was
but
the
princess
noticed
the
ironical
and
contemptuous
look
that
showed
itself
on
his
must
be
indulgent
to
little
who
is
free
from
forget
that
she
has
grown
up
and
been
educated
in
and
so
her
position
now
is
not
a
rosy
we
should
enter
into
tout
tout
think
what
it
must
be
for
poor
after
what
she
has
been
used
to
be
parted
from
her
husband
and
be
left
alone
in
the
in
her
very
to
understand
all
is
to
forgive
prince
andrew
smiled
as
he
looked
at
his
as
we
smile
at
those
we
think
we
thoroughly
live
in
the
country
and
think
the
life
he
why
speak
of
i
want
any
other
and
for
i
know
no
but
for
a
young
society
woman
to
be
buried
in
the
country
during
the
best
years
of
her
all
papa
is
always
and
you
know
what
poor
resources
i
have
for
entertaining
a
woman
used
to
the
best
there
is
only
mademoiselle
like
your
mademoiselle
bourienne
at
said
prince
she
is
very
nice
and
kind
above
much
to
be
she
has
no
no
to
tell
the
i
need
and
even
in
my
you
know
i
always
was
a
and
now
am
even
more
i
like
being
father
likes
her
very
she
and
michael
ivanovich
are
the
two
people
to
whom
he
is
always
gentle
and
because
he
has
been
a
benefactor
to
them
as
sterne
love
people
so
much
for
the
good
they
have
done
as
for
the
good
we
have
done
father
took
her
when
she
was
homeless
after
losing
her
own
she
is
very
and
my
father
likes
her
way
of
she
reads
to
him
in
the
evenings
and
reads
be
quite
i
expect
character
sometimes
makes
things
trying
for
prince
andrew
asked
princess
mary
was
first
surprised
and
then
aghast
at
this
for
trying
for
said
always
was
rather
and
now
i
should
think
getting
very
said
prince
apparently
speaking
lightly
of
their
father
in
order
to
puzzle
or
test
his
are
good
in
every
but
you
have
a
kind
of
intellectual
said
the
following
the
train
of
her
own
thoughts
rather
than
the
trend
of
the
a
great
how
can
one
judge
but
even
if
one
what
feeling
except
veneration
could
such
a
man
as
my
father
and
i
am
so
contented
and
happy
with
i
only
wish
you
were
all
as
happy
as
i
her
brother
shook
his
head
only
thing
that
is
hard
for
i
will
tell
you
the
is
way
of
treating
religious
i
understand
how
a
man
of
his
immense
intellect
can
fail
to
see
what
is
as
clear
as
and
can
go
so
far
that
is
the
only
thing
that
makes
me
but
even
in
this
i
can
see
lately
a
shade
of
his
satire
has
been
less
bitter
of
and
there
was
a
monk
he
received
and
had
a
long
talk
my
i
am
afraid
you
and
your
monk
are
wasting
your
said
prince
andrew
banteringly
yet
mon
i
only
and
hope
that
god
will
hear
she
said
timidly
after
a
have
a
great
favor
to
ask
of
is
that
you
will
not
it
will
give
you
no
trouble
and
is
nothing
unworthy
of
but
it
will
comfort
said
putting
her
hand
in
her
reticule
but
not
yet
taking
out
what
she
was
holding
inside
as
if
what
she
held
were
the
subject
of
her
request
and
must
not
be
shown
before
the
request
was
she
looked
timidly
at
her
if
it
were
a
great
deal
of
answered
prince
as
if
guessing
what
it
was
what
you
i
know
you
are
just
like
think
as
you
but
do
this
for
my
please
our
wore
it
in
all
his
still
did
not
take
out
what
she
was
holding
in
her
you
what
is
i
bless
you
with
this
icon
and
you
must
promise
me
you
will
never
take
it
do
you
it
does
not
weigh
a
hundredweight
and
break
my
to
please
said
prince
but
noticing
the
pained
expression
his
joke
had
brought
to
his
he
repented
and
am
i
am
very
your
will
he
will
save
and
have
mercy
on
you
and
bring
you
to
for
in
him
alone
is
truth
and
said
she
in
a
voice
trembling
with
solemnly
holding
up
in
both
hands
before
her
brother
a
icon
of
the
saviour
in
a
gold
on
a
finely
wrought
silver
she
crossed
kissed
the
and
handed
it
to
for
my
rays
of
gentle
light
shone
from
her
timid
those
eyes
lit
up
the
whole
of
her
sickly
face
and
made
it
her
brother
would
have
taken
the
but
she
stopped
andrew
crossed
himself
and
kissed
the
there
was
a
look
of
for
he
was
but
also
a
gleam
of
irony
on
his
my
she
kissed
him
on
the
forehead
and
sat
down
again
on
the
they
were
silent
for
a
i
was
saying
to
be

sternly
at

and
an
expression
of
anger
suddenly
came
over
his
he
said
nothing
to
her
but
looked
at
her
forehead
and
without
looking
at
her
with
such
contempt
that
the
frenchwoman
blushed
and
went
away
without

he
reached
his
room
his

was
already
awake
and
her
merry
hurrying
one
word
after
came
through

open
she
was
speaking
as
usual
in

as
if
after
long
she
wished
to
make
up
for
lost
but
imagine
the
old
countess
with
false
curls
and
her
mouth
full
of
false
as
if
she
were
trying

laugh

part
of
the

he
suddenly
shouted
in
a
angry
opening

both
princesses
when
they
saw
for
a
moment
at
the
door

andrew
and
the
figure
of

in
a
white

spectacled
and
shouting

with
her
beautiful
eyes
full
of
tears
at
the
door
through
which
prince
andrew
had
gone
and
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
in
his
from
the
like
pistol
came
the
frequent
sound
of
the
old
man
angrily
blowing
his
hardly
had
prince
andrew
gone
when
the
study
door
opened
quickly
and
the
stern
figure
of
the
old
man
in
the
white
dressing
gown
looked
all
said
and
looking
angrily
at
the
unconscious
little
he
shook
his
head
reprovingly
and
slammed
the
book
1805
chapter
i
in
a
russian
army
was
occupying
the
villages
and
towns
of
the
archduchy
of
and
yet
other
regiments
freshly
arriving
from
russia
were
settling
near
the
fortress
of
braunau
and
burdening
the
inhabitants
on
whom
they
were
braunau
was
the
headquarters
of
the
on
october
one
of
the
infantry
regiments
that
had
just
reached
braunau
had
halted
half
a
mile
from
the
waiting
to
be
inspected
by
the
despite
the
appearance
of
the
locality
and
stone
tiled
and
hills
in
the
despite
the
fact
that
the
inhabitants
gazed
with
curiosity
at
the
were
not
the
regiment
had
just
the
appearance
of
any
russian
regiment
preparing
for
an
inspection
anywhere
in
the
heart
of
on
the
evening
of
the
last
march
an
order
had
been
received
that
the
would
inspect
the
regiment
on
the
though
the
words
of
the
order
were
not
clear
to
the
regimental
and
the
question
arose
whether
the
troops
were
to
be
in
marching
order
or
it
was
decided
at
a
consultation
between
the
battalion
commanders
to
present
the
regiment
in
parade
on
the
principle
that
it
is
always
better
to
too
low
than
not
bow
low
so
the
after
a
were
kept
mending
and
cleaning
all
night
long
without
closing
their
while
the
adjutants
and
company
commanders
calculated
and
and
by
morning
the
of
the
disorderly
crowd
it
had
been
on
its
last
march
the
day
a
array
of
two
thousand
men
each
of
whom
knew
his
place
and
his
had
every
button
and
every
strap
in
and
shone
with
and
not
only
externally
was
all
in
but
had
it
pleased
the
to
look
under
the
uniforms
he
would
have
found
on
every
man
a
clean
and
in
every
knapsack
the
appointed
number
of
and
as
the
soldiers
there
was
only
one
circumstance
concerning
which
no
one
could
be
at
it
was
the
state
of
the
more
than
half
the
boots
were
in
but
this
defect
was
not
due
to
any
fault
of
the
regimental
for
in
spite
of
repeated
demands
boots
had
not
been
issued
by
the
austrian
and
the
regiment
had
marched
some
seven
hundred
the
commander
of
the
regiment
was
an
and
general
with
grizzled
eyebrows
and
and
wider
from
chest
to
back
than
across
the
he
had
on
a
uniform
showing
the
creases
where
it
had
been
folded
and
thick
gold
epaulettes
which
seemed
to
stand
rather
than
lie
down
on
his
massive
he
had
the
air
of
a
man
happily
performing
one
of
the
most
solemn
duties
of
his
he
walked
about
in
front
of
the
line
and
at
every
step
pulled
himself
slightly
arching
his
it
was
plain
that
the
commander
admired
his
rejoiced
in
and
that
his
whole
mind
was
engrossed
by
yet
his
strut
seemed
to
indicate
besides
military
social
interests
and
the
fair
sex
occupied
no
small
part
of
his
michael
he
addressing
one
of
the
battalion
commanders
who
smilingly
pressed
forward
was
plain
that
they
both
felt
had
our
hands
full
last
i
think
the
regiment
is
not
a
bad
the
battalion
commander
perceived
the
jovial
irony
and
would
not
be
turned
off
the
field
even
on
the
tsaritsin
asked
the
at
that
on
the
road
from
the

sent
to
confirm
the
order

had
not
been
clearly
worded

day

wished
to
see
the
regiment

in
the
state
in
which
it
had
been
on
the
in
their

and
without
any
preparation
a
member
of
the
hofkriegsrath
from
vienna
had
come
to
kutuzov
the
day
before
with
proposals
and
demands
for
him
to
join
up
with
the
army
of
the
archduke
ferdinand
and
and
not
considering
this
junction
among
other
arguments
in
support
of
his
to
show
the
austrian
general
the
wretched
state
in
which
the
troops
arrived
from

this
object

intended
to
meet

the
worse
the
condition
it
was
the
better
pleased
the
would
though
the
did
not
know
these
he
nevertheless
delivered
the
definite
order
that
the
men
should
be
in
their
greatcoats
and
in
marching

that
the
would
otherwise
be

spread
out
his

choleric
fine
mess

the

thrusting
forward
his
jaw

pointing
at
a
soldier
in

ranks
of

greatcoat
of

steps
down

pleased
at
his

display
of

further
excuse
for

country

on

creaking

drawn
by
six

of

the
austrian

were
talking
in
low
voices
and
kutuzov
smiled
slightly
as
treading
heavily
he
stepped
down
from
the
carriage
just
as
if
those
two
thousand
men
breathlessly
gazing
at
him
and
the
regimental
commander
did
not
the
word
of
command
rang
and
again

jingling
sound

amidst
a
dead
silence

feeble
voice
of

again
all

kutuzov
stood
still

devoured
him
with
his
drawing
himself
up
and
from

he
walked
through
the
ranks
behind
the
bending
forward
and
hardly
able
to
restrain
his
jerky
and
from
the
way
he
darted
forward
at
every
word
or
gesture
of
the
it
was
evident
that
he
performed
his
duty
as
a
subordinate
with
even
greater
zeal
than
his
duty
as
a
thanks
to
the
strictness
and
assiduity
of

commander

with

everything
was
in

the
kutuzov
walked
through

stopping
to
say
a
few
friendly
words
to
officers
he
had
known
in
the
turkish
sometimes
also
to
the
looking
at
their
boots
he
several
times
shook
his
head
pointing
them
out
to
the
austrian
general
with
an
expression
which
seemed
to
say
that
he
was
not
blaming
but
could
not
help
noticing
what
a
bad
state
of
things
it
the
regimental
commander
ran
forward
on
each
such
fearing
to
miss
a
single
word
of
the
regarding
the
behind
at
a
distance
that
allowed
every
softly
spoken
word
to
be
followed

twenty

among
themselves

beside
him
was
his
comrade
a
tall
staff
extremely
with
a
handsome
face
and
moist
nesvitski
could
hardly
keep
from
laughter
provoked
by
a
swarthy
hussar
officer
who
walked
beside
this
with
a
grave
face
and
without
a
smile
or
a
change
in
the
expression
of
his
fixed
watched
the
regimental
back
and
mimicked
his
every
each
time
the
commander
started
and
bent
the
hussar
started
and
bent
forward
in
exactly
the

and
nudged
the
others
to
make
them
look
at

slowly
and
languidly
past
thousands
of
eyes
which
were
starting
from
their
sockets
to
watch
their

reaching
the
third
company
he
suddenly
his
not
having
expected
involuntarily
came
closer
to
said
recognizing
the
captain
who
had
been
reprimanded
on
account
of
the
blue
one
would
have
thought
it
impossible
for
a
man
to
stretch
himself
more
than
timokhin
had
done
when
he
was
reprimanded
by
the
regimental
but
now
that
the
addressed
him
he
drew
himself
up
to
such
an
extent
that
it
seemed
he
could
not
have
sustained
it
had
the
continued
to
look
at

so
who
evidently
understood
his
case
and
wished
him
nothing
but
quickly
turned
a
scarcely
perceptible
smile
flitting
over
his
scarred
and
puffy
ismail
said
brave
are
you
satisfied
with
he
asked
the
regimental
and
the
that
he
was
being
reflected
in
the
hussar
officer
as
in
a
looking
moved
and
your
all
have
our
said
kutuzov
smiling
and
walking
away
from

to
have
a
predilection
for
the
regimental
commander
was
afraid
he
might
be
blamed
for
this
and
did
not
the
hussar
at
that
moment
noticed
the
face
of
the
captain
and
his
and
mimicked
his
expression
and
pose
with
such
exactitude
that
nesvitski
could
not
help
kutuzov
turned
the
officer
evidently
had
complete
control
of
his
and
while
kutuzov
was
turning
managed
to
make
a
grimace
and
then
assume
a
most
and
innocent
the
third
company
was
the

kutuzov
apparently
trying
to
recollect
prince
andrew
stepped
forward
from
among
the
suite

said

me
to

you
of

at

as
boldly
as
they
had
looked
at

by
their
expression
to
tear
open
the

separates

timokhin

over

away
with
a
grimace

if
to
say
that
everything
dolokhov
had
said
to
him
and
everything
he
could
say
had
long
been
known
to
that
he
was
weary
of
it

it

now

only
change
being
that
the

replaced
by
having
jerked
out
these

waved

pleasure
at

the
sight
of

particular
grace
and
boldness
in

looking
at

driving

if

pitied

set

by
zherkov
had
met
dolokhov
abroad
as
a
private
and
had
not
seen
fit
to
recognize
but
now
that
kutuzov
had
spoken
to
the
gentleman
he
addressed
him
with
the
cordiality
of
an
old
dear
how
are
said
he
through
the
making
his
horse
keep

with

dolokhov

as
you
the
lively
song
gave
a
special
flavor

the
tone

and
easy
gaiety

zherkov

to
the
intentional
coldness
of
how
do
you

on
with
the
inquired
they
are
good

how
have
you
wriggled
onto
the
was
on
both
were
let
the
hawk
fly
upward
from
her
wide
right
went
the
arousing
an
involuntary
sensation
of
courage
and
their
conversation
would
probably
have
been
different
but
for
the
effect
of
that
it
true
that
austrians
have
been
asked
devil
only
they
say
answered
dolokhov
briefly
and
as
the
song
come
round
some
evening
and
have
a
game
of
said
have
you
too
much
sworn
not
i
drink
and
play
till
i
get
only
till
the
first
shall
they
were
again
if
you
need
one
can
at

be
of
use
on
the
dolokhov
if
i
want
i
take
never
i
i
a
long
to
my
native
zherkov
touched
his
horse
with
the
it
pranced
excitedly
from
foot
to
foot
uncertain
with
which
to
then
settled
galloped
past
the
and
overtook
the
still
keeping
time
to
the
chapter
iii
on
returning
from
the
kutuzov
took
the
austrian
general
into
his
private
room
calling
his
asked
for
some
papers
relating
to
the
condition
of
the
troops
on
their
and
the
letters
that
had
come
from
the
archduke
who
was
in
command
of
the
advanced
prince
andrew
bolkonski
came
into
the
room
with
the
required
kutuzov
and
the
austrian
member
of
the
hofkriegsrath
were
sitting
at
the
table
on
which
a
plan
was
spread
said
kutuzov
glancing
at
bolkonski
as
if
by
this
exclamation
he
was
asking
the
adjutant
to
and
he
went
on
with
the
conversation
in
i
can
said
he
with
a
pleasant
elegance
of
expression
and
intonation
that
obliged
one
to
listen
to
each
deliberately
spoken
it
was
evident
that
kutuzov
himself
listened
with
pleasure
to
his
own
i
can
is
that
if
the
matter
depended
on
my
personal
the
will
of
his
majesty
the
emperor
francis
would
have
been
fulfilled
long
i
should
long
ago
have
joined
the
and
believe
me
on
my
honour
that
to
me
personally
it
would
be
a
pleasure
to
hand
over
the
supreme
command
of
the
army
into
the
hands
of
a
better
informed
and
more
skillful
whom
austria
has
so
to
lay
down
all
this
heavy
but
circumstances
are
sometimes
too
strong
for
and
kutuzov
smiled
in
a
way
that
seemed
to
are
quite
at
liberty
not
to
believe
me
and
i
even
care
whether
you
do
or
but
you
have
no
grounds
for
telling
me
and
that
is
the
whole
the
austrian
general
looked
but
had
no
option
but
to
reply
in
the
same
the
he
in
a
querulous
and
angry
tone
that
contrasted
with
his
flattering
the
your
participation
in
the
common
action
is
highly
valued
by
his
but
we
think
the
present
delay
is
depriving
the
splendid
russian
troops
and
their
commander
of
the
laurels
they
have
been
accustomed
to
win
in
their
he
concluded
his
evidently
prearranged
kutuzov
bowed
with
the
same
that
is
my
and
judging
by
the
last
letter
with
which
his
highness
the
archduke
ferdinand
has
honored
i
imagine
that
the
austrian
under
the
direction
of
so
skillful
a
leader
as
general
have
by
now
already
gained
a
decisive
victory
and
no
longer
need
our
said
the
general
though
there
was
no
definite
news
of
an
austrian
there
were
many
circumstances
confirming
the
unfavorable
rumors
that
were
and
so
suggestion
of
an
austrian
victory
sounded
much
like
but
kutuzov
went
on
blandly
smiling
with
the
same
which
seemed
to
say
that
he
had
a
right
to
suppose
in
the
last
letter
he
had
received
from
army
informed
him
of
a
victory
and
stated
strategically
the
position
of
the
army
was
very
me
that
said
kutuzov
turning
to
prince
have
a
look
at
kutuzov
with
an
ironical
smile
about
the
corners
of
his
mouth
read
to
the
austrian
general
the
following
in
from
the
archduke
we
have

kutuzov
sighed
deeply
on
finishing
this
paragraph
and
looked
at
the
member
of
the
hofkriegsrath
mildly
and
you
know
the
wise
maxim
your
advising
one
to
expect
the
said

austrian
evidently
wishing
to

of

then
give
it
to
his
prince
andrew
bowed
his
head
in
token
of
having
understood
from
the
first
not
only
what
had
been
said
but
also
what
kutuzov
would
have
liked
to
tell
he
gathered
up
the
papers
and
with
a
bow
to
stepped
softly
over
the
carpet
and
went
out
into
the
waiting
though
not
much
time
had
passed
since
prince
andrew
had
left
he
had
changed
greatly
during
that
in
the
expression
of
his
in
his
in
his
scarcely
a
trace
was
left
of
his
former
affected
languor
and
he
now
looked
like
a
man
who
has
time
to
think
of
the
impression
he
makes
on
but
is
occupied
with
agreeable
and
interesting
his
face
expressed
more
satisfaction
with
himself
and
those
around
his
smile
and
glance
were
brighter
and
more

he
had
overtaken
in

promised
not

to
his
old
prince
your
son
bids
fair
to
become
an
officer

i
consider
myself
fortunate
to
have
such
a
subordinate

in

from
everyone
expected
great
things
of

with
them
prince
andrew
was
natural
and
the
disliked
him
and
considered
him
and
but
among
these
people
prince
andrew
knew
how
to
take
his
stand
so
that
they
respected
and
even
feared
coming
out
of
room
into
the
waiting
room
with
the
papers
in

hand
prince
andrew
came
up
to
his

that

at
that

a

general
in

and
a

down
at

the

quivered

he
took

stepped
quickly
to

threw
himself
into

at

in

as
if

he
lifted
his
stretched
his
neck
as
if
he
intended
to
say
but
with
affected
began
to
hum
to
producing
a
queer
sound
which
immediately
broke
the
door
of
the
private
room
opened
and
kutuzov
appeared
in
the
the

with
the
bandaged
head
bent
forward
as
though
running
away
from

making
quick
strides
with
his
thin
went
up
to
voyez
le

he
uttered
in
a
broken
face
as
he
stood
in
the
open
doorway
remained
perfectly
immobile
for
a
few
then
wrinkles
ran
over
his
face
like
a
wave
and
his
forehead
became
smooth
he
bowed
his
head
closed
his
silently
let
mack
enter
his
room
before
and
closed
the
door
himself
behind
the
report
which
had
been
circulated
that
the
austrians
had
been
beaten
and
that
the
whole
army
had
surrendered
at
ulm
proved
to
be
within
half
an
hour
adjutants
had
been
sent
in
various
directions
with
orders
which
showed
that
the
russian
who
had
hitherto
been
would
also
soon
have
to
meet
the
prince
andrew
was
one
of
those
rare
staff
officers
whose
chief
interest
lay
in
the
general
progress
of
the
when
he
saw
mack
and
heard
the
details
of
his
disaster
he
understood
that
half
the
campaign
was
understood
all
the
difficulties
of
the
russian
and
vividly
imagined
what
awaited
it
and
the
part
he
would
have
to
involuntarily
he
felt
a
joyful
agitation
at
the
thought
of
the
humiliation
of
arrogant
austria
and
that
in
a
time
he
see
and
take
part
in
the
first
russian
encounter
with
the
french
since
suvorov
met
he
feared
that
genius
might
outweigh
all
the
courage
of
the
russian
and
at
the
same
time
could
not
admit
the
idea
of
his
hero
being
excited
and
irritated
by
these
thoughts
prince
andrew
went
toward
his
room
to
write
to

just
as

met
nesvitski
and
there
came
toward
them
from
the

end
of
the
an

in

for

pushing
nesvitski
aside
with
his

were
passing
looking
as
if
they
wished
to
avoid

on
the
face
of
the
wag
zherkov
there
suddenly
appeared
a
stupid
smile
of
glee
which
he
seemed
unable
to

he
in
stepping
forward
and
addressing
the
austrian
have
the
honor
to
congratulate

bowed
his
head
and
scraped
first
with
one
foot
and
then
with
the
like
a
child
at
a
dancing
the
member
of
the
hofkriegsrath
looked
at
him
severely
seeing
the
seriousness
of
his
stupid
could
not
but
give
him
a

screwed
up
his
eyes
showing
that
he
was

the
honor

congratulate

he
after
he
had
gone

nesvitski
with
a
laugh
threw
his
arms
round
prince
but
turning
still
pushed
him
away
with
an
angry
look
and
turned
to
the
nervous
irritation
aroused
by
the
appearance
of
the
news
of
his
and
the
thought
of
what
lay
before
the
russian
army
found
vent
in

were
so
surprised
by
this
outburst
that
they
gazed
at
bolkonski
silently

taking

smiling
and
raising

as
if

cost
him
a
great
deal
to

he
sat
down
at
the
nearest
both
were
there
were
two
germans
and
a
russian
officer
in
the
no
one
spoke
and
the
only
sounds
heard
were
the
clatter
of
knives
and
the
munching
of
the
when
telyanin
had
finished
his
lunch
he
took
out
of
his
pocket
a
double
purse
drawing
its

out
a

and
lifting
his

went
up

almost
with
shifting
eyes
but
eyebrows
still
telyanin
handed
him
the

nice

growing
suddenly
and
at
young
rostov
took
the
purse
in
his
examined
it
and
the
money
in
and
looked
at
the
lieutenant
was
looking
about
in
his
usual
way
and
suddenly
seemed
to
grow
very
we
get
to
vienna

rid
of
it
there
but
in
these
wretched
little
towns
nowhere
to
spend

stretched
out
his
hand
to
take
hold
of
the
rostov
let
go
of
telyanin
took
the
purse
and
began
carelessly
slipping
it
into
the
pocket
of
his
riding
with
his
eyebrows
lifted
and
his
mouth
slightly
as
if
to
i
am
putting
my
purse
in
my
pocket
and
quite
simple
and
is
no
one
young
he
said
with
a
and
from
under
his
lifted
brows
he
glanced
into
some
flash
as
of
an
electric
spark
shot
from
eyes
to
and
and
back
again
and
again
in
an
said
catching
hold
of
arm
and
almost
dragging
him
to
the
money
is
you
took
he
whispered
just
above
how
dare
said
but
these
words
came
like
a
despairing
cry
and
an
entreaty
for
as
soon
as
rostov
heard
an
enormous
load
of
doubt
fell
from
he
was
and
at
the
same
instant
began
to
pity
the
miserable
man
who
stood
before
but
the
task
he
had
begun
had
to
be
only
knows
what
the
people
here
may
muttered
taking
up
his
cap
and
moving
toward
a
small
empty
must
have
an
know
it
and
shall
prove
said
every
muscle
of
terrified
face
began
to
his
eyes
still
shifted
from
side
to
side
but
with
a
downward
look
not
rising
to
and
his
sobs
were
ruin
a
young
here
is
this
wretched
take
he
threw
it
on
the
have
an
old
father
and
rostov
took
the
avoiding
and
went
out
of
the
room
without
a
but
at
the
door
he
stopped
and
then
retraced
his
he
said
with
tears
in
his
could
you
do
said
telyanin
drawing
nearer
to
touch
said
drawing
you
need
take
the
and
he
threw
the
purse
to
him
and
ran
out
of
the
chapter
v
that
same
evening
there
was
an
animated
discussion
among
the
officers
in
i
tell
that
you
must
apologize
to
the
said
a
staff
with
enormous
mustaches
and
many
wrinkles
on
his
large
to
rostov
who
was
crimson
with
the
staff
had
twice
been
reduced
to
the
ranks
for
affairs
of
honor
and
had
twice
regained
his
will
allow
no
one
to
call
me
a
cried
told
me
i
and
i
told
him
he
and
there
it
he
may
keep
me
on
duty
every
or
may
place
me
under
but
no
one
can
make
me
because
if
as
commander
of
this
thinks
it
beneath
his
dignity
to
give
me
just
wait
a
my
dear
and
interrupted
the
staff
captain
in
his
deep
calmly
stroking
his
long
tell
the
colonel
in
the
presence
of
other
officers
that
an
officer
has
not
to
blame
that
the
conversation
began
in
the
presence
of
other
perhaps
i
ought
not
to
have
spoken
before
but
i
am
not
a
why
i
joined
the
thinking
that
here
one
would
not
need
and
he
tells
me
that
i
am
let
him
give
me
all
no
one
thinks
you
a
but
not
the
ask
denisov
whether
it
is
not
out
of
the
question
for
a
cadet
to
demand
satisfaction
of
his
regimental
denisov
sat
gloomily
biting
his
mustache
and
listening
to
the
evidently
with
no
wish
to
take
part
in
he
answered
the
staff
question
by
a
disapproving
shake
of
his
speak
to
the
colonel
about
this
nasty
business
before
other
continued
the
staff
colonel
was
called
you
did
not
shut
me
he
said
i
was
telling
an
have
it
and
you
talked
a
lot
of
nonsense
to
him
and
must
on
any
exclaimed
did
not
expect
this
of
said
the
staff
captain
seriously
and
wish
to
not
only
to
him
but
to
the
whole
of
to
blame
all
the
case
is
you
ought
to
have
thought
the
matter
over
and
taken
but
you
go
and
blurt
it
all
straight
out
before
the
now
what
was
the
colonel
to
have
the
officer
tried
and
disgrace
the
whole
disgrace
the
whole
regiment
because
of
one
is
that
how
you
look
at
we
see
it
like
and
bogdanich
was
a
he
told
you
you
were
saying
what
was
not
not
but
to
be
my
dear
you
landed
yourself
in
and
when
one
wants
to
smooth
the
thing
some
conceit
prevents
your
and
you
wish
to
make
the
whole
affair
you
are
offended
at
being
put
on
duty
a
but
why
not
apologize
to
an
old
and
honorable
whatever
bogdanich
may
anyway
he
is
an
honorable
and
brave
old
quick
at
taking
but
you
mind
disgracing

to
have
been
in
the

the
denisov

silent
and
did
not
but
occasionally
looked
with
his
glittering
black
eyes
at
value
your
own
pride
and
wish
to

the
staff

rippling
and

round
the
piles
of

chased

a

with

a

suddenly
heard
a

shouting
continually

moved
the

squeezed
themselves
to
make

for

again
pressed
on
him
so
that
they
jammed
his

those
nearest
him
were
not
to

for
they
were
themselves
pressed
still
harder
from

a
hoarse

from

away

which
separates

all
the
more
clearly

line
which

be
crossed

you
will
have
to
find

puckering
up

why
are
you
stopping

the

crossed
the

drew
out

crossed
the
retired

one
after
the
their
karl
bogdanich
came
up
to
squadron
and
rode
at
a
footpace
not
far
from
without
taking
any
notice
of
him
although
they
were
now
meeting
for
the
first
time
since
their
encounter
concerning
feeling
that
he
was
at
the
front
and
in
the
power
of
a
man
toward
whom
he
now
admitted
that
he
had
been
to

not
lift
his
eyes
from
the
athletic
his
nape
covered
with
light
and
his

it
seemed
to
rostov
that
bogdanich
was
only
pretending
not
to
notice
and
that
his
whole
aim
now
was
to
test
the
so
he
drew
himself
up
and
looked
around
him
then
it
seemed
to
him
that
bogdanich
rode
so
near
in
order
to
show
him
his
next
he
thought
that
his
enemy
would
send
the
squadron
on
a
desperate
attack
just
to
punish
then
he
imagined
after
the
bogdanich
would
come
up
to
him
as
he
lay
wounded
and
would
magnanimously
extend
the
hand
of
the
figure
of
familiar
to
the
pavlograds
as
he
had
but
recently
left
their
rode
up
to
the
after
his
dismissal
from
headquarters
zherkov
had
not
remained
in
the
saying
he
was
not
such
a
fool
as
to
slave
at
the

came
to
his

followed
by
an
officer
of
the
suite
who
rode
up
to
the
colonel
of
hussars
with
the
same
after
him
the
stout
nesvitski
came
galloping
up
on
a
cossack
horse
that
could
scarcely

shouted
as
he
told

now
someone
has

and
they
are
all
beside
themselves
over

continued
the

in
an
offended
interrupted
the
officer
of

be
quick
or
the
enemy
will
bring
up
his
guns
to

the

looked
silently
at
the
officer
of
the
at
the
stout
staff
and
at
and
he
will
the

he
said
in
a
solemn
tone
as
if
to
announce
that
in
spite
of
all
the
unpleasantness
he
had
to
endure
he
would
still
do
the
right
striking
his
horse
with
his
long
muscular
legs
as
if
it
were
to
blame
for
the
colonel
moved
forward
and
ordered
the
second
that
in
which
rostov
was
serving
under
to
return
to
the
just
as
i
said
rostov
to
wishes
to
test
his
heart
contracted
and
the
blood
rushed
to
his

see
whether
i
am
a

again
on
all
the
bright
faces
of
the
squadron
the
serious
expression
appeared
that
they
had
worn
when
under
rostov
watched
his
the
find
in
his
face
confirmation
of
his
own
but
the
colonel
did
not
once
glance
at
and
looked
as
he
always
did
when
at
the
solemn
and
then
came
the
word
of
look
several
voices
repeated
around
their
sabers
catching
in
the
bridles
and
their
spurs
the
hussars
hastily
not
knowing
what
they
were
to
the
men
were
crossing
rostov
no
longer
looked
at
the
he
had
no
he
was
afraid
of
falling
behind
the
so
much
afraid
that
his
heart
stood
his
hand
trembled
as
he
gave
his
horse
into
an
and
he
felt
the
blood
rush
to
his
heart
with
a
denisov
rode
past
leaning
back
and
shouting
rostov
saw
nothing
but
the
hussars
running
all
around
their
spurs
catching
and
their
sabers
shouted
someone
behind
rostov
did
not
think
what
this
call
for
stretchers
he
ran
trying
only
to
be
ahead
of
the
but
just
at
the
not
looking
at
the
he
came
on
some
trodden
and
fell
on
his
the
others
outstripped
boss
he
heard
the
voice
of
the
having
ridden
had
pulled
up
his
horse
near
the
with
a
cheerful
rostov
wiping
his
muddy
hands
on
his
breeches
looked
at
his
enemy
and
was
about
to
run
thinking
that
the
farther
he
went
to
the
front
the
but
without
looking
at
or
recognizing
shouted
to
that
running
on
the
middle
of
the
to
the
come
he
cried
and
turning
to
showing
off
his
had
ridden
on
to
the
planks
of
the
run
you
should
he
every
bullet
has
its
answered
vaska
turning
in
his
meanwhile
and
the
officer
of
the
suite
were
standing
together
out
of
range
of
the
now
the
small
group
of
men
with
yellow
jackets
braided
with
and
blue
riding
who
were
swarming
near
the
and
then
at
what
was
approaching
in
the
distance
from
the
opposite
blue
uniforms
and
groups
with
easily
recognizable
as
they
burn
the
bridge
or
get
there
will
they
get
there
and
fire
the
bridge
or
will
the
french
get
within
grapeshot
range
and
wipe
them
these
were
the
questions
each
man
of
the
troops
on
the
high
ground
above
the
bridge
involuntarily
asked
himself
with
a
sinking
the
bridge
and
the
hussars
in
the
bright
evening
light
and
the
blue
tunics
advancing
from
the
other
side
with
their
bayonets
and
the
hussars
will
get
it
said
are
within
grapeshot
range
have
taken
so
many
said
the
officer
of
the
answered
smart
fellows
could
have
done
the
job
just
as
your
put
in
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
but
still
with
that
naive
air
that
made
it
impossible
to
know
whether
he
was
speaking
in
jest
or
in
your
how
you
look
at
send
two
and
who
then
would
give
us
the
vladimir
medal
and
but
even
if
they
do
get
the
squadron
may
be
recommended
for
honors
and
he
may
get
a
our
bogdanich
knows
how
things
are
said
the
officer
of
the
he
pointed
to
the
french
the
limbers
of
which
were
being
detached
and
hurriedly
on
the
french
amid
the
groups
with
a
cloud
of
smoke
then
a
second
and
a
third
almost
and
at
the
moment
when
the
first
report
was
heard
a
fourth
was
then
two
reports
one
after
and
a
groaned
nesvitski
as
if
in
fierce
seizing
the
officer
of
the
suite
by
the
a
man
has
i
i
were
tsar
i
would
never
go
to
said
turning
the
french
guns
were
hastily
the
infantry
in
their
blue
uniforms
advanced
toward
the
bridge
at
a
smoke
appeared
again
but
at
irregular
and
grapeshot
cracked
and
rattled
onto
the
but
this
time
nesvitski
could
not
see
what
was
happening
as
a
dense
cloud
of
smoke
arose
from
the
hussars
had
succeeded
in
setting
it
on
fire
and
the
french
batteries
were
now
firing
at
no
longer
to
hinder
them
but
because
the
guns
were
trained
and
there
was
someone
to
fire
the
french
had
time
to
fire
three
rounds
of
grapeshot
before
the
hussars
got
back
to
their
two
were
misdirected
and
the
shot
went
too
but
the
last
round
fell
in
the
midst
of
a
group
of
hussars
and
knocked
three
of
them
absorbed
by
his
relations
with

paused
on
the
bridge
not
knowing
what
to
there
was
no
one
to
hew
down
he
had
always
imagined
battles
to
nor
could
he
help
to
fire
the
bridge
because
he
had
not
brought
any
burning
straw
with
him
like
the
other
he
stood
looking
about
when
suddenly
he
heard
a
rattle
on
the
bridge
as
if
nuts
were
being
and
the
hussar
nearest
to
him
fell
against
the
rails
with
a
rostov
ran
up
to
him
with
the
again
someone
four
men
seized
the
hussar
and
began
lifting
for
sake
let
me
cried
the
wounded
but
still
he
was
lifted
and
laid
on
the
nicholas
rostov
turned
away
as
if
searching
for
gazed
into
the
at
the
waters
of
the
at
the
and
at
the
how
beautiful
the
sky
how
how
and
how
how
bright
and
glorious
was
the
setting
with
what
soft
glitter
the
waters
of
the
distant
danube
and
fairer
still
were
the
faraway
blue
mountains
beyond
the
the
the
mysterious
and
the
pine
forests
veiled
in
the
mist
of
their
there
was
peace
and
should
wish
for
nothing
if
only
i
were
thought
myself
alone
and
in
that
sunshine
there
is
so
much
but
and
this
uncertainty
and
are
shouting
and
again
are
all
running
back
and
i
shall
run
with
and
is
here
above
me
and
another
instant
and
i
shall
never
again
see
the
this
that
at
that
instant
the
sun
began
to
hide
behind
the
and
other
stretchers
came
into
view
before
and
the
fear
of
death
and
of
the
and
love
of
the
sun
and
of
all
merged
into
one
feeling
of
sickening
lord
thou
who
art
in
that
and
protect
rostov
the
hussars
ran
back
to
the
men
who
held
their
their
voices
sounded
louder
and
the
stretchers
disappeared
from
so
smelt
shouted
vaska
denisov
just
above
his
all
but
i
am
a
a
thought
and
sighing
deeply
he
took
his
which
stood
resting
one
from
the
orderly
and
began
to
that
he
asked
and
no
cried
worked
like
wegular
bwicks
and
nasty
an
pleasant
hacking
away
at
the
but
this
sort
of
thing
is
the
very
with
them
shooting
at
you
like
a
and
denisov
rode
up
to
a
group
that
had
stopped
near
composed
of
the
and
the
officer
from
the
it
seems
that
no
one
has
thought
and
this
was
no
one
had
taken
any
for
everyone
knew
the
sensation
which
the
cadet
under
fire
for
the
first
time
had
something
for
you
to
said
if
i
get
promoted
to
a
the
prince
that
i
the
bridge
said
the
colonel
triumphantly
and
if
he
asks
about
the
said
the
colonel
in
his
bass
hussars
and
one
knocked

unable
to
restrain
a
happy
and
pronouncing
the
phrase
with
ringing
chapter
ix
pursued
by
the
french
army
of
a
hundred
thousand
men
under
the
command
of
encountering
a
population
that
was
unfriendly
to
losing
confidence
in
its
suffering
from
shortness
of

compelled
to
act
under
conditions
of
war
unlike
anything
that
had
been
the
russian
army
of

men
commanded
by
kutuzov
was
hurriedly
retreating
along
the
stopping
where
overtaken
by
the
enemy
and
fighting
rearguard
actions
only
as
far
as
necessary
to
enable
it
to
retreat
without
losing
its
heavy
there
had
been
actions
at
and
but
despite
the
courage
and
even
by
the
which
the
russians
the
only
consequence
of
these
actions
was
a
yet
more
rapid
austrian
troops
that
had
escaped
capture
at
ulm
and
had
joined
kutuzov
at
braunau
now
separated
from
the
russian
and
kutuzov
was
left
with
only
his
own
weak

exhausted

defense
of
vienna

no

to
kutuzov
when
he
was
in
vienna
by
the
austrian
the
sole
and
almost
unattainable
aim
remaining
for
him
was
to
effect
a
junction
with
the
forces
that
were
advancing
from
without
losing
his
army
as
mack
had
done
at
on
the
of
october
kutuzov
with
his
army
crossed
to
the
left
bank
of
the
danube
and
took
up
a
position

the
first
time

main
body

was
on

first

were

for
the
first

had
halted
and
after
a
fight
had
not
only
held
the
field
but
had
repulsed

the
troops
were
and
had
lost
a
third
of
their
number
in
and
though
a
number
of
sick
and
wounded
had
been
abandoned
on
the
other
side
of
the
danube
with
a
letter
in
which
kutuzov
entrusted
them
to
the
humanity
of

though
the
big
hospitals
and
the
houses
in
krems
converted
into
military
hospitals
could
no
longer
accommodate
all
the
sick
and
yet
the
stand
made
at
krems
and
the
victory
over
mortier
raised
the
spirits
of
the
army
throughout
the
whole
army
and
at
headquarters
most
joyful
though
erroneous
rumors
were
rife
of
the
imaginary
approach
of

of

victory
gained

of

his

grazed

delicate
build
prince
andrew
could
endure
physical
fatigue
far
better
than

muscular

on
the
night
of
the
having
arrived
at

excited

not

a
reward
but
an
important
step
toward

dark
but
the
road
showed
black
in
the
snow
that
had
fallen
the
previous
day
of

impressions
of
the
recent

pleasantly
to
himself
the
impression

news
of
a
victory

or
recalling
the
given
him
by
the
and
his
fellow
prince
andrew
was
galloping
along
in
a
post
chaise
enjoying
the
feelings
of
a
man
who
has
at
length
begun
to
attain
a
as
soon
as
he
closed
his
eyes
his
ears
seemed
filled
with
the
rattle
of
the
wheels
and
the
sensation
of
then
he
began
to
imagine
that
the
russians
were
running
away
and
that
he
himself
was
but
he
quickly
roused
himself
with
a
feeling
of
as
if
learning
afresh
that
this
was
not
so
but
that
on
the
contrary
the
french
had
run
he
again
recalled
all
the
details
of
the
victory
and
his
own
calm
courage
during
the
and
feeling
reassured
he
dozed
the
dark
starry
night
was
followed
by
a
bright
cheerful
the
snow
was
thawing
in
the
the
horses
galloped
and
on
both
sides
of
the
road
were
forests
of
different
and
at
one
of
the
post
stations
he
overtook
a
convoy
of
russian
the
russian
officer
in
charge
of
the
transport
lolled
back
in
the
front
shouting
and
scolding
a
soldier
with
coarse
in
each
of
the
long
german
carts
six
or
more
bandaged
men
were
being
jolted
over
the
stony
some
of
them
were
talking

russian
others
were
eating

more
severely
wounded

with
the
languid
interest
of
sick
at
the
envoy
hurrying
past
prince
andrew
told
his
driver
to
and
asked
a
soldier
in
what
action
they
had
been
before
on
the
answered
the
prince
andrew
took
out
his
purse
and
gave
the
soldier
three
gold
for
them
he
said
to
the
officer
who
came
well
he
turning
to
the
plenty
to
do
asked
the
evidently
anxious
to
start
a
go
he
shouted
to
the
and
they
galloped
it
was
already
quite
dark
when
prince
andrew
rattled
over
the
paved
streets
of
brunn
and
found
himself
surrounded
by
high
the
lights
of
and
street
fine
and
all
that
atmosphere
of
a
large
and
active
town
which
is
always
so
attractive
to
a
soldier
after
camp
despite
his
rapid
journey
and
sleepless
prince
andrew
when
he
drove
up
to
the
palace
felt
even
more
vigorous
and
alert
than
he
had
done
the
day
only
his
eyes
gleamed
feverishly
and
his
thoughts
followed
one
another
with
extraordinary
clearness
and
he
again
vividly
recalled
the
details
of
the
no
longer
but
definite
and
in
the
concise
form
in
which
he
imagined
himself
stating
them
to
the
emperor
he
vividly
imagined
the
casual
questions
that
might
be
put
to
him
and
the
answers
he
would
he
expected
to
be
at
once
presented
to
the
at
the
chief
entrance
to
the
an
official
came
running
out
to
meet
and
learning
that
he
was
a
special
messenger
led
him
to
another

right
from
the

you
will
find
the
adjutant

conduct
you
to
the
minister
of
the
adjutant
on
meeting
prince
asked
him
to
and
went
in
to
the
minister
of
five
minutes
later
he
returned
and
bowing
with
particular
courtesy
ushered
prince
andrew
before
him
along
a
corridor
to
the
cabinet
where
the
minister
of
war
was
at
the
adjutant
by
his
elaborate
courtesy
appeared
to
wish
to
ward
off
any
attempt
at
familiarity
on
the
part
of
the
russian
prince
joyous
feeling
was
considerably
weakened
as
he
approached
the
door
of
the
he
felt
and
without
his
noticing
it
the
feeling
of
offense
immediately
turned
into
one
of
disdain
which
was
quite
uncalled
his
fertile
mind
instantly
suggested
to
him
a
point
of
view
which
gave
him
a
right
to
despise
the
adjutant
and
the
from
the
smell
of
they
probably
think
it
easy
to
gain
he
his
eyes
narrowed
he
entered
the
room
of
the
minister
of
war
with
peculiarly
deliberate
this
feeling
of
disdain
was
heightened
when
he
saw
the
minister
seated
at
a
large
table
reading
some
papers
and
making
pencil
notes
on
and
for
the
first
two
or
three
minutes
taking
no
notice
of
his
a
wax
candle
stood
at
each
side
of
the
bent
bald
head
with
its
gray
he
went
on
reading
to
the
without
raising
his
eyes
at
the
opening
of
the
door
and
the
sound
of
this
and
deliver
said
he
to
his
handing
him
the
papers
and
still
taking
no
notice
of
the
special
prince
andrew
felt
that
either
the
actions
of
army
interested
the
minister
of
war
less
than
any
of
the
other
matters
he
was
concerned
or
he
wanted
to
give
the
russian
special
messenger
that
that
is
a
matter
of
perfect
indifference
to
he
the
minister
drew
the
remaining
papers
arranged
them
and
then
raised
his
he
had
an
intellectual
and
distinctive
but
the
instant
he
turned
to
prince
andrew
the
intelligent
expression
on
his
face
changed
in
a
way
evidently
deliberate
and
habitual
to
his
face
took
on
the
stupid
artificial
smile
does
not
even
attempt
to
hide
its
of
a
man
who
is
continually
receiving
many
petitioners
one
after
general
field
marshal
he
hope
it
is
good
there
has
been
an
encounter
with
a
it
was
high
he
took
the
dispatch
which
was
addressed
to
him
and
began
to
read
it
with
a
mournful
my
my
he
exclaimed
in
a
what
a
having
glanced
through
the
dispatch
he
laid
it
on
the
table
and
looked
at
prince
evidently
considering
what
a
you
say
the
affair
was
but
mortier
is
not
again
he
am
very
glad
you
have
brought
good
though
death
is
a
heavy
price
to
pay
for
the
his
majesty
will
no
doubt
wish
to
see
but
not
i
thank
you
must
have
a
be
at
the
levee
tomorrow
after
the
i
will
let
you
the
stupid
which
had
left
his
face
while
he
was
thank
you
very
his
majesty
will
probably
desire
to
see
he
bowing
his
when
prince
andrew
left
the
palace
he
felt
that
all
the
interest
and
happiness
the
victory
had
afforded
him
had
been
now
left
in
the
indifferent
hands
of
the
minister
of
war
and
the
polite
the
whole
tenor
of
his
thoughts
instantaneously
the
battle
seemed
the
memory
of
a
remote
event

chapter
x
prince
andrew
stayed
at
brunn
with
a
russian
acquaintance
of
his
in
the
diplomatic
my
dear
i
could
not
have
a
more
welcome
said
bilibin
as
he
came
out
to
meet
prince
put
the
things
in
my
said
he
to
the
servant
who
was
ushering
bolkonski
a
messenger
of
and
i
am
sitting
here
as
you
after
washing
and
prince
andrew
came
into
the
luxurious
study
and
sat
down
to
the
dinner
prepared
for
bilibin
settled
down
comfortably
beside
the
after
his
journey
and
the
campaign
during
which
he
had
been
deprived
of
all
the
comforts
of
cleanliness
and
all
the
refinements
of
prince
andrew
felt
a
pleasant
sense
of
repose
among
luxurious
surroundings
such
as
he
had
been
accustomed
to
from
besides
it
was
after
his
reception
by
the
to
speak
if
not
in
russian
they
were
speaking
at
least
with
a
russian
who
he
share
the
general
russian
antipathy
to
the
austrians
which
was
then
particularly
bilibin
was
a
man
of
a
and
of
the
same
circle
as
prince
they
had
known
each
other
previously
in
but
had
become
more
intimate
when
prince
andrew
was
in
vienna
with
just
as
prince
andrew
was
a
young
man
who
gave
promise
of
rising
high
in
the
military
so
to
an
even
greater
extent
bilibin
gave
promise
of
rising
in
his
diplomatic
he
still
a
young
man
but
no
longer
a
young
as
he
had
entered
the
service
at
the
age
of
had
been
in
paris
and
and
now
held
a
rather
important
post
in
both
the
foreign
minister
and
our
ambassador
in
vienna
knew
him
and
valued
he
was
not
one
of
those
many
diplomats
who
are
esteemed
because
they
have
certain
negative
avoid
doing
certain
and
speak
he
was
one
of
liking
knew
how
to
do
and
despite
his
indolence
would
sometimes
spend
a
whole
night
at
his
writing
he
worked
well
whatever
the
import
of
his
it
was
not
the
question
but
the
question
that
interested
what
the
diplomatic
matter
might
be
he
did
not
but
it
gave
him
great
pleasure
to
prepare
a
or
and
services
were
valued
not
only
for
what
he
but
also
for
his
skill
in
dealing
and
conversing
with
those
in
the
highest
bilibin
liked
conversation
as
he
liked
only
when
it
could
be
made
elegantly
in
society
he
always
awaited
an
opportunity
to
say
something
striking
and
took
part
in
a
conversation
only
when
that
was
his
conversation
was
always
sprinkled
with
wittily
finished
phrases
of
general
these
sayings
were
prepared
in
the
inner
laboratory
of
his
mind
in
a
portable
form
as
if
so
that
insignificant
society
people
might
carry
them
from
drawing
room
to
drawing
in
witticisms
were
hawked
about
in
the
viennese
drawing
rooms
and
often
had
an
influence
on
matters
considered
his
sallow
face
was
covered
with
deep
which
always
looked
as
clean
and
well
washed
as
the
tips
of
fingers
after
a
russian
the
movement
of
these
wrinkles
formed
the
principal
play
of
expression
on
his
now
his
forehead
would
pucker
into
deep
folds
and
his
eyebrows
were
then
his
eyebrows
would
descend
and
deep
wrinkles
would
crease
his
his
eyes
always
twinkled
and
looked
out
now
tell
me
about
your
said
very
modestly
without
once
mentioning
described
the
engagement
and
his
reception
by
the
minister
of

me
and
my
news
as
one
receives
a
dog
in
a
game
of

he
in
bilibin
smiled
and

on
his
face

examining
his
nails
from
a
distance
and
puckering
the
skin
above
his

votre
victoire
pas
des
plus
my
dear
with
all
my
respect
for
the
orthodox
russian
i
must
say
that
your
victory
was
not
particularly
he
went
on
talking
in
this
way
in
uttering
only
those
words
in
russian
on
which
he
wished
to
put
a
contemptuous
you
with
all
your
forces
fall
on
the
unfortunate
mortier
and
his
one
and
even
then
mortier
slips
through
your
the
said
prince
can
at
any
rate
say
without
boasting
that
it
was
a
little
better
than
at
you
capture
just
marshal
for
not
everything
happens
as
one
expects
or
with
the
smoothness
of
a
we
had
as
i
told
to
get
at
their
rear
by
seven
in
the
morning
but
had
not
reached
it
by
five
in
the
why
you
do
it
at
seven
in
the
you
ought
to
have
been
there
at
seven
in
the
returned
bilibin
with
a
ought
to
have
been
there
at
seven
in
the
did
you
not
succeed
in
impressing
on
bonaparte
by
diplomatic
methods
that
he
had
better
leave
genoa
retorted
prince
andrew
in
the
same
interrupted
thinking
very
easy
to
take
sitting
on
a
sofa
by
the
that
is
but
still
why
you
capture
so
be
surprised
if
not
only
the
minister
of
war
but
also
his
most
august
majesty
the
emperor
and
king
francis
is
not
much
delighted
by
your
even
a
poor
secretary
of
the
russian
do
not
feel
any
need
in
token
of
my
joy
to
give
my
franz
a
or
let
him
go
with
his
liebchen
to
the
we
have
no
prater
he
looked
straight
at
prince
andrew
and
suddenly
unwrinkled
his
is
now
my
turn
to
ask
you
mon
said
confess
i
do
not
perhaps
there
are
diplomatic
subtleties
here
beyond
my
feeble
but
i
make
it
mack
loses
a
whole
the
archduke
ferdinand
and
the
archduke
karl
give
no
signs
of
life
and
make
blunder
after
kutuzov
alone
at
last
gains
a
real
destroying
the
spell
of
the
invincibility
of
the
and
the
minister
of
war
does
not
even
care
to
hear
the
just
my
dear
you
see
hurrah
for
the
for
for
the
orthodox
greek
all
that
is
but
what
do
i
mean
the
austrian
care
for
your
bring
us
nice
news
of
a
victory
by
the
archduke
karl
or
ferdinand
as
good
as
as
you
and
even
if
it
is
only
over
a
fire
brigade
of
that
will
be
another
story
and
fire
off
some
but
this
sort
of
thing
seems
done
on
purpose
to
vex
the
archduke
karl
does
the
archduke
ferdinand
disgraces
you
abandon
give
up
its
much
as
to
is
with
but
heaven
help
you
and
your
the
one
general
whom
we
all
you
expose
to
a
and
then
you
congratulate
us
on
the
admit
that
more
irritating
news
than
yours
could
not
have
been
as
if
it
had
been
done
on
on
suppose
you
did
gain
a
brilliant
if
even
the
archduke
karl
gained
a
what
effect
would
that
have
on
the
general
course
of
too
late
now
when
vienna
is
occupied
by
the
french
vienna
only
but
bonaparte
is
at
and
the
our
dear
count
goes
to
him
for
after
the
fatigues
and
impressions
of
the
his
and
especially
after
having
bolkonski
felt
that
he
could
not
take
in
the
full
significance
of
the
words
he
lichtenfels
was
here
this
bilibin
showed
me
a
letter
in
which
the
parade
of
the
french
in
vienna
was
fully
prince
murat
et
tout
le
you
see
that
your
victory
is
not
a
matter
for
great
rejoicing
and
that
you
be
received
as
a
i
care
about
i
care
at
said
prince
beginning
to
understand
that
his
news
of
the
battle
before
krems
was
really
of
small
importance
in
view
of
such
events
as
the
fall
of
is
it
vienna
was
what
of
the
bridge
and
its
celebrated
bridgehead
and
prince
we
heard
reports
that
prince
auersperg
was
defending
he
auersperg
is
on
on
our
side
of
the
and
is
defending
it
very
i
but
still
he
is
defending
but
vienna
is
on
the
other
the
bridge
has
not
yet
been
taken
and
i
hope
it
will
not
for
it
is
mined
and
orders
have
been
given
to
blow
it
otherwise
we
should
long
ago
have
been
in
the
mountains
of
and
you
and
your
army
would
have
spent
a
bad
quarter
of
an
hour
between
two
still
this
does
not
mean
that
the
campaign
is
said
prince
i
think
it
the
bigwigs
here
think
so
but
they
say
it
will
be
as
i
said
at
the
beginning
of
the
it
be
your
skirmishing
at
or
gunpowder
at
that
will
decide
the
but
those
who
devised
said
bilibin
quoting
one
of
his
own
releasing
the
wrinkles
on
his
and
only
question
is
what
will
come
of
the
meeting
between
the
emperor
alexander
and
the
king
of
prussia
in
if
prussia
joins
the
hand
will
be
forced
and
there
will
be
if
not
it
is
merely
a
question
of
settling
where
the
preliminaries
of
the
new
campo
formio
are
to
be
drawn
an
extraordinary
prince
andrew
suddenly
clenching
his
small
hand
and
striking
the
table
with
what
luck
the
man
said
bilibin
puckering
up
his
forehead
to
indicate
that
he
was
about
to
say
something
he
accentuating
the
now
that
he
lays
down
laws
for
austria
at
il
faut
lui
faire
grace
de
i
shall
certainly
adopt
an
innovation
and
call
him
simply
must
let
him
off
the
joking
said
prince
you
really
think
the
campaign
is
is
what
i
austria
has
been
made
a
fool
and
she
is
not
used
to
she
will
and
she
has
been
fooled
in
the
first
place
because
her
provinces
have
been
say
the
holy
russian
army
loots
army
is
her
capital
and
all
this
for
the
beaux
yeux
of
his
sardinian
and
is
between
instinctively
feel
that
we
are
being
my
instinct
tells
me
of
negotiations
with
france
and
projects
for
a
secret
peace
concluded
fine
cried
prince
would
be
too
we
live
we
shall
replied
his
face
again
becoming
smooth
as
a
sign
that
the
conversation
was
at
an
when
prince
andrew
reached
the
room
prepared
for
him
and
lay
down
in
a
clean
shirt
on
the
feather
bed
with
its
warmed
and
fragrant
he
felt
that
the
battle
of
which
he
had
brought
tidings
was
far
away
from
the
alliance
with
new
levee
and
and
the
audience
with
the
emperor
francis
occupied
his
he
closed
his
and
immediately
a
sound
of
of
musketry
and
the
rattling
of
carriage
wheels
seemed
to
fill
his
and
now
again
drawn
out
in
a
thin
line
the
musketeers
were
descending
the
the
french
were
and
he
felt
his
heart
palpitating
as
he
rode
forward
beside
schmidt
with
the
bullets
merrily
whistling
all
and
he
experienced
tenfold
the
joy
of
as
he
had
not
done
since
he
woke
that
all
he
smiling
happily
to
himself
like
a
he
fell
into
a
youthful
chapter
xi
next
day
he
woke
recalling
his
recent
the
first
thought
that
came
into
his
mind
was
that
today
he
had
to
be
presented
to
the
emperor
he
remembered
the
minister
of
the
polite
austrian
and
last
having
dressed
for
his
attendance
at
court
in
full
parade
which
he
had
not
worn
for
a
long
he
went
into
study
and
with
his
hand
in
the
study
were
four
gentlemen
of
the
diplomatic
with
prince
hippolyte
who
was
a
secretary
to
the
bolkonski
was
already
bilibin
introduced
him
to
the
the
gentlemen
assembled
at
were
gay
society
who
as
in
formed
a
special
set
which
their
called
les
this
consisting
almost
exclusively
of
evidently
had
its
own
interests
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
war
or
politics
but
related
to
high
to
certain
and
to
the
official
side
of
the
these
gentlemen
received
prince
andrew
as
one
of
an
honor
they
did
not
extend
to
from
politeness
and
to
start
they
asked
him
a
few
questions
about
the
army
and
the
and
then
the
talk
went
off
into
merry
jests
and
the
best
of
it
said
telling
of
the
misfortune
of
a
fellow
the
chancellor
told
him
flatly
that
his
appointment
to
london
was
a
promotion
and
that
he
was
so
to
regard
can
you
fancy
the
figure
he
the
worst
of
am
giving
kuragin
away
to
that
that
man

this

wicked

taking
advantage
of
prince
hippolyte

lolling
in
a
lounge
chair
with
his
legs
over
its
he
began
to
me
about
he
you
don
you
cried
several
said
bilibin
turning
to
prince
all
the
atrocities
of
the
french
army
nearly
said
of
the
russian
are
nothing
compared
to
what
this
man
has
been
doing
among
the
femme

compagne
de
announced
prince
and
began
looking
through
a
lorgnette
at
his
elevated
is
bilibin
and
the
rest
of
burst
out
laughing
in
and
prince
andrew
saw
that
of

almost
been
jealous

the
butt
of
this

sat
down
beside

round

said
to
prince
seizing
him
by
the
believe
that
intervention
will
be
stronger
than
he

cannot
impute
the
nonreceipt
of
our

xii
at

andrew
stood
among
the
austrian
officers
as
he
had
been
told
and
the
emperor
francis
merely
looked
fixedly
into
his
face
and
just
nodded
to
him
with
his
long
but
after
it
was
the
adjutant
he
had
seen
the
previous
day
ceremoniously
informed
bolkonski
that
the
emperor
desired
to
give
him

received
him
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
before
the
conversation
began
prince
andrew
was
struck
by
the
fact
that
the
emperor
seemed
confused
and
blushed
as
if
not
knowing
what
to
when
did
the
battle
he
asked
prince
andrew
then
followed
other
questions
just
as
kutuzov
when
had
he
left
and
so
the
emperor
spoke
as
if
his
sole
aim
were
to
put
a
given
number
of
answers
to
these
as
was
only
too
did
not
interest
what
did

more
animated
and
expecting
that
he
would
have
a
chance
to
give
a
reliable
which
he
had
ready
in
his
of
all
he

and

the

and

prince

was
immediately
surrounded
by
courtiers
on
all
everywhere
he
saw
friendly
looks
and
heard
friendly
adjutant
reproached
him
for
not
having
stayed
at
the
and
offered
him
his

the
whole
morning
calling
on
the
principal
austrian

four
and
five
in
the
having
made
all
his
he
was
returning
to
house
thinking
out
a
letter
to
his
father
about
the
battle
and
his
visit
to
at
the
door
he
found
a
vehicle
half
full
of
was
dragging
a
portmanteau
with
some
difficulty
out
of
the
front
before
returning
to
prince
andrew
had
gone
to
a
bookshop
to
provide
himself
with
some
books
for
the
and
had
spent
some
time
in
the
is
he
your
said
with
difficulty
rolling
the
portmanteau
into
the
are
to
move
on
still
the
scoundrel
is
again
at
our
asked
prince
bilibin
came
out
to
meet
his
usually
calm
face
showed
confess
that
this
is
said
affair
of
the
thabor
at
they
have
crossed
without
striking
a
prince
andrew
could
not
where
do
you
come
from
not
to
know
what
every
coachman
in
the
town
come
from
the
i
heard
nothing
you
see
that
everybody
is
packing
did
what
is
it
all
inquired
prince
andrew
it
all
the
french
have
crossed
the
bridge
that
auersperg
was
and
the
bridge
was
not
blown
so
murat
is
now
rushing
along
the
road
to
brunn
and
will
be
here
in
a
day
or
but
why
did
they
not
blow
up
the
if
it
was
is
what
i
ask
no
not
even
knows
bolkonski
shrugged
his
if
the
bridge
is
crossed
it
means
that
the
army
too
is
it
will
be
cut
said
just
answered
the
french
entered
vienna
as
i
told
very
next
which
was
those
messieurs
les
and
mount
and
ride
to
the
that
all
three
are
says
one
of
know
the
thabor
bridge
is
mined
and
doubly
mined
and
that
there
are
menacing
fortifications
at
its
head
and
an
army
of
fifteen
thousand
men
has
been
ordered
to
blow
up
the
bridge
and
not
let
us
but
it
will
please
our
sovereign
the
emperor
napoleon
if
we
take
this
so
let
us
three
go
and
take
say
the
and
off
they
go
and
take
the
cross
and
now
with
their
whole
army
are
on
this
side
of
the
marching
on
and
your
lines
of
the
said
prince
andrew
sadly
and
this
news
grieved
him
and
yet
he
was
as
soon
as
he
learned
that
the
russian
army
was
in
such
a
hopeless
situation
it
occurred
to
him
that
it
was
he
who
was
destined
to
lead
it
out
of
this
that
here
was
the
toulon
that
would
lift
him
from
the
ranks
of
obscure
officers
and
offer
him
the
first
step
to
listening
to
bilibin
he
was
already
imagining
how
on
reaching
the
army
he
would
give
an
opinion
at
the
war
council
which
would
be
the
only
one
that
could
save
the
and
how
he
alone
would
be
entrusted
with
the
executing
of
the
this
he
am
not
bilibin
went
is
truer
or
these
gentlemen
ride
onto
the
bridge
alone
and
wave
white
they
assure
the
officer
on
duty
that
the
are
on
their
way
to
negotiate
with
prince
he
lets
them
enter
the
they
spin
him
a
thousand
saying
that
the
war
is
that
the
emperor
francis
is
arranging
a
meeting
with
that
they
desire
to
see
prince
and
so
the
officer
sends
for
these
gentlemen
embrace
the
crack
sit
on
the
and
meanwhile
a
french
battalion
gets
to
the
bridge
flings
the
bags
of
incendiary
material
into
the
and
approaches
the
at
length
appears
the
lieutenant
our
dear
prince
auersperg

flower
of
the
austrian
hero
of
the
turkish
wars
hostilities
are
we
can
shake
one
the
emperor
napoleon
burns
with
impatience
to
make
prince
in
a
those
gascons
so
bewildered
him
with
fine
and
he
is
so
flattered
by
his
rapidly
established
intimacy
with
the
french
and
so
dazzled
by
the
sight
of
mantle
and
ostrich
voit

in
spite
of
the
animation
of
his
bilibin
did
not
forget
to
pause
after
this
mot
to
give
time
for
its
due
french
battalion
rushes
to
the
spikes
the
and
the
bridge
is
but
what
is
best
of
he
went
his
excitement
subsiding
under
the
delightful
interest
of
his
own
that

sergeant
in
charge
of

was
to
give
the
signal
to
fire

is

the
sergeant

astonishment

a
stroke

his
dignity

must
own
that
this
affair
of
the

not

into
his
eyes

he

everybody
attached
to

to

andrew
struck
the
high
road
along
which
the
russian
army
was
moving
with
great
haste

in

so
obstructed

remembered
these
words
in
address
to
his
army
at
the
beginning
of
the
and
they
awoke
in
him
astonishment
at
the
genius
of
his
a
feeling
of
wounded
and
a
hope
of
should
there
be
nothing
left

to
he

confused
mass

of

blocking
the
muddy

the

solitary
soldiers
sat

off
to

neighboring

returned
from
them

and
bulging
at

the

feebly
heard
amid
the
uproar

one
saw
by
their
faces
that
they
despaired
of
the
possibility
of
checking

our

orthodox
russian
thought

out
where
the

up
to

opposite

rigged
up
by
soldiers

looking
like
something
between

soldier

a
woman
enveloped
in
shawls
sat
behind
the
apron
under
the
leather
hood
of
the
prince
andrew
rode
up
and
was
just
putting
his
question
to
a
soldier
when
his
attention
was
diverted
by
the
desperate
shrieks
of
the
woman
in
the
an
officer
in
charge
of
transport
was
beating
the
soldier
who
was
driving
the
vehicle

the
strokes
of
his
whip
fell
on

leaned
out

her
thin

this
expression
evidently
pleased

a
nice
snub
for
the
little
came
a
voice
from
prince
andrew
saw
that
the
officer
was
in
that
state
of
tipsy
rage
when
a
man
does
not
know
what
he
is
he
saw
that
his
championship
of
the
wife

her
queer
trap
might
expose
him
to
what
he
dreaded
more
than
anything

up

fellows
on
the
staff

you

andrew

lifting
his
eyes

hastily
away
from
the
who
was
calling
him
her
and
recalling
with
a
sense
of
disgust
the
minutest
details
of
this
humiliating
scene
he
galloped
on
to
the
village
where
he
was
told
that
the
on
reaching
the
village
he
dismounted
and
went
to
the
nearest
intending
to
rest
if
but
for
a
eat
and
try
to
sort
out
the
stinging
and
tormenting
thoughts
that

a
mob
of
scoundrels
and

entering

another

having
something
to

hastily
turned
round
to
him
asking
if
he
had
any

their
familiar

he
read
agitation
and
this
was
particularly
noticeable
on
usually
laughing

but
the

with
you
must
be
ill
to
shiver
like
he
noticing
that
prince
andrew
winced
as
at
an
electric
replied
prince
he
had
just
remembered
his
recent
encounter
with
the

and
the
convoy

the
doing

make
out
at
said
all
i
can
make
out
is
that
everything
is
quite
said
prince
and
he
went
off
to
the
house
where
the
passing
by
carriage
and
the
exhausted
saddle
horses
of
his
with
their
cossacks
who
were
talking
loudly
prince
andrew
entered
the
kutuzov
he
was
was
in
the
house
with
prince
bagration
and
weyrother
was
the
austrian
general
who
had
succeeded
in
the
passage
little
kozlovski

squatting
on
his
heels
in

of
a

hastily
writing
at
a

turned
bottom

looked
too

evidently
not

all
he
glanced
at
prince
andrew
and
did
not
even
nod
to
have
you
written
he
continued
dictating
to
the
kiev
write
so
your
said
the
glancing
angrily
and
disrespectfully
at
through
the
door
came
the
sounds
of
excited
and
interrupted
by
an
unfamiliar
from
the
sound
of
these
the
inattentive
way
kozlovski
looked
at
the
disrespectful
manner
of
the
exhausted
the
fact
that
the
clerk
and
kozlovski
were
squatting
on
the
floor
by
a
tub
so
near
to
the
commander
in
and
from
the
noisy
laughter
of
the
cossacks
holding
the
horses
near
the
prince
andrew
felt
that
something
important
and
disastrous
was
about
to
he
turned
to
kozlovski
with
urgent
said
for
about
of
the
orders
are
issued
for
a
prince
andrew
moved
toward
the
door
from
whence
voices
were
just
as
he
was
going
to
open
it
the
sounds
the
door
and
kutuzov
with
his
eagle
nose
and
puffy
face
appeared
in
the
prince
andrew
stood
right
in
front
of
kutuzov
but
the
expression
of
the
commander
in
one
sound
eye
showed
him
to
be
so
preoccupied
with
thoughts
and
anxieties
as
to
be
oblivious
of
his
he
looked
straight
at
his
face
without
recognizing
have
you
said
he
to
your
a
gaunt
man
of
medium
height
with
a
impassive
face
of
oriental
came
out
after
the
have
the
honor
to
present
repeated
prince
andrew
rather
handing
kutuzov
an

kutuzov
went
out
into
the
porch
with
said
he
to
and
may
christ
be
with
you
in
your
great
his
face
suddenly
softened
and
tears
came
into
his
with
his
left
hand
he
drew
bagration
toward
and
with
his
on
which
he
wore
a
he
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
him
with
a
gesture
evidently
offering
his
puffy
but
bagration
kissed
him
on
the
neck

repeated
and
went
toward
his
in
with
said
he
to
i
should
like
to
be
of
use
allow
me
to
remain
with
prince
said
and
noticing
that
bolkonski
still
he
need
good
officers
need
them
they
got
into
the
carriage
and
drove
for
a
few
minutes
in
is
still
much
before
he
as
if
with
an
old
penetration
he
understood
all
that
was
passing
in
a
tenth
part
of
his
detachment
returns
i
shall
thank
he
added
as
if
speaking
to
prince
andrew
glanced
at
face
only
a
foot
distant
from
him
and
involuntarily
noticed
the
carefully
washed
seams
of
the
scar
near
his
where
an
ismail
bullet
had
pierced
his
and
the
empty
eye
he
has
a
right
to
speak
so
calmly
of
those
thought
is
why
i
beg
to
be
sent
to
that
he
kutuzov
did
not
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
what
he
had
been
and
sat
plunged
in
five
minutes
gently
swaying
on
the
soft
springs
of
the
he
turned
to
prince
there
was
not
a
trace
of
agitation
on
his
with
delicate
irony
he
questioned
prince
andrew
about
the
details
of
his
interview
with
the
about
the
remarks
he
had
heard
at
court
concerning
the
krems
and
about
some
ladies
they
both
chapter
xiv
on
november

kutuzov
had
through
a
news
that
the
army
he
commanded
was
in
an
almost
hopeless
the
spy
reported
that
the
after
crossing
the
bridge
at
were
advancing
in
immense
force
upon
line
of
communication
with
the
troops
that
were
arriving
from
if
kutuzov
decided
to
remain
at
army
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
men
would
cut
him
off
completely
and
surround
his
exhausted
army
of
forty
and
he
would
find
himself
in
the
position
of
mack
at
if
kutuzov
decided
to
abandon
the
road
connecting
him
with
the
troops
arriving
from
he
would
have
to
march
with
no
road
into
unknown
parts
of
the
bohemian
defending
himself
against
superior
forces
of
the
enemy
and
abandoning
all
hope
of
a
junction
with
if
kutuzov
decided
to
retreat
along
the
road
from
krems
to
to
unite
with
the
troops
arriving
from
he
risked
being
forestalled
on
that
road
by
the
french
who
had
crossed
the
vienna
and
encumbered
by
his
baggage
and
having
to
accept
battle
on
the
march
against
an
enemy
three
times
as
who
would
hem
him
in
from
two
kutuzov
chose
this
latter
the
the
spy
having
crossed
the
vienna
were
advancing
by
forced
marches
toward
which
lay
miles
off
on
the
line
of

he
reached
znaim
before
the
there
would
be
great
hope
of
saving
the
to
let
the
french
forestall
him
at
znaim
meant
the
exposure
of
his
whole
army
to
a
disgrace
such
as
that
of
or
to
utter
but
to
forestall
the
french
with
his
whole
army
was
the
road
for
the
french
from
vienna
to
znaim
was
shorter
and
better
than
the
road
for
the
russians
from
krems
to
the
night
he
received
the
kutuzov
sent
four
thousand
to
the
right
across
the
hills
from
the

the

was
to
make
this
march
without
and
to
halt
facing
vienna
with
znaim
to
his
and
if
he
succeeded
in
forestalling
the
french
he
was
to
delay
them
as
long
as
kutuzov
himself
with
all
his
transport
took
the
road
to
marching
thirty
miles
that
stormy
night
across
roadless
with
his
and
losing
a
third
of
his
men
as
stragglers
by
the
bagration
came
out
on
the
road
at
hollabrunn
a
few
hours
ahead
of
the
french
who
were
approaching
hollabrunn
from
kutuzov
with
his
transport
had
still
to
march
for
some
days
before
he
could
reach
hence
bagration
with
his
four
thousand
exhausted
men
would
have
to
detain
for
days
the
whole
enemy
army
that
came
upon
him
at
which
was
clearly
but
a
freak
of
fate
made
the
impossible
the
success
of
the
trick
that
had
placed
the
vienna
bridge
in
the
hands
of
the
french
without
a
fight
led
murat
to
try
to
deceive
kutuzov
in
a
similar
meeting
weak
detachment
on
the
znaim
road
he
supposed
it
to
be
whole
to
be
able
to
crush
it
absolutely
he
awaited
the
arrival
of
the
rest
of
the
troops
who
were
on
their
way
from
and
with
this
object
offered
a
three
truce
on
condition
that
both
armies
should
remain
in
position
without
murat
declared
that
negotiations
for
peace
were
already
and
that
he
therefore
offered
this
truce
to
avoid
unnecessary
count
the
austrian
general
occupying
the
advanced
believed
emissary
and
leaving
division
another
emissary
rode
to
the
russian
line
to
announce
the
peace
negotiations
and
to
offer
the
russian
army
the
three
bagration
replied
that
he
was
not
authorized
either
to
accept
or
refuse
a
truce
and
sent
his
adjutant
to
kutuzov
to
report
the
offer
he
had
a
truce
was
sole
chance
of
gaining
giving
exhausted
troops
some
and
letting
the
transport
and
heavy
convoys
movements
were
concealed
from
the
advance
if
but
one
stage
nearer
the
offer
of
a
truce
gave
the
and
a
quite
chance
of
saving
the

receiving
the
news
he
immediately
dispatched
adjutant
general
who
was
in
attendance
on

the
enemy
wintzingerode
was
not
merely
to
agree
to
the
truce
but
also
to
offer
terms
of

meanwhile
kutuzov
sent
his
adjutants
back
to
hasten
to
the
utmost
the
movements
of
the
baggage
trains
of
the
entire
army
along
the
exhausted
and
hungry
which
alone
covered
this
movement
of
the
transport
and
of
the
whole
had
to
remain
stationary
in
face
of
an
enemy
eight
times
as
strong
as
expectations
that
the
proposals
of
capitulation
were
in
no
way
might
give
time
for
part
of
the
transport
to
and
also
that
mistake
would
very
soon
be
proved
as
soon
as
bonaparte
was
at
sixteen
miles
from
received
dispatch
with
the
proposal
of
a
truce
and
a

detected
a
ruse

ordinary
little
staff
dandies
sent

earn
a

he
can
get

here
if

with
a
diamond
ring
on
his
who
was
fond
of
speaking
french
though
he
spoke
it
offered
to
conduct
prince
on
all
sides
they
saw
officers
with
dejected
faces
who
seemed
to
be
seeking
and
soldiers
dragging
and
fencing
from
the
we
stop
those
said
the
staff
officer
pointing
to
the
officers

them
in

he
pointed
to
a
crowd
in
and
this
morning
i
turned
them
all
out
and
now
full
i
must
go
and
scare
them
a
it
take
a
go
in
and
i
will
get
myself
a
roll

some
said
prince
andrew

had
time
to
eat
you
mention
i
would
have
offered
you

dismounted
and
entered
the
several
with
flushed
and
weary
were
sitting
at
the
table
eating
and
what
does
this
said
the
staff
in
the
reproachful
tone
of
a
man
who
has
repeated
the
same
thing
more
than
know
it
do
to
leave
your
posts
like
the
prince
gave
orders
that
no
one
should
leave
his
now
and
he
turned
to
a
dirty
little
artillery
officer
who
without
his
boots
had
given
them
to
the
canteen
keeper
to
in
only
his
rose
when
they
smiling
not
altogether
you
ashamed
of
captain
he
would
think
that
as
an
artillery
officer
you
would
set
a
good
yet
here
you
are
without
your
the
alarm
will
be
sounded
and
be
in
a
pretty
position
without
your
staff
officer
return
to
your
all
of
he
added
in
a
tone
of
prince
andrew
smiled
involuntarily
as
he
looked
at
the
artillery
officer
who
silent
and
shifting
from
one
stockinged
foot
to
the
glanced
inquiringly
with
his
kindly
eyes
from
prince
andrew
to
the
staff
soldiers
say
it
feels
easier
without
said
captain
tushin
smiling
shyly
in
his
uncomfortable
evidently
wishing
to
adopt
a
jocular
but
before
he
had
finished
he
felt
that
his
jest
was
unacceptable
and
had
not
come
he
grew
return
to
your
said
the
staff
officer
trying
to
preserve
his
prince
andrew
glanced
again
at
the
artillery
small
there
was
something
peculiar
about
quite
rather
but
extremely
the
staff
officer
and
prince
andrew
mounted
their
horses
and
rode
having
ridden
beyond
the
continually
meeting
and
overtaking
soldiers
and
officers
of
various
they
saw
on
their
left
some
entrenchments
being
thrown
the
freshly
dug
clay
of
which
showed
up
several
battalions
of
in
their
shirt
sleeves
despite
the
cold
swarmed
in
these
earthworks
like
a
host
of
white
spadefuls
of
red
clay
were
continually
being
thrown
up
from
behind
the
bank
by
unseen
prince
andrew
and
the
officer
rode
looked
at
the
and
went
on
just
behind
it
they
came
upon
some
dozens
of
continually
replaced
by
who
ran
from
the
they
had
to
hold
their
noses
and
put
their
horses
to
a
trot
to
escape
from
the
poisoned
atmosphere
of
these
des
monsieur

said
the
staff
is
a
pleasure
one
gets
in
they
rode
up
the
opposite
from
there
the
french
could
already
be
prince
andrew
stopped
and
began
examining
the
our
said
the
staff
officer
indicating
the
highest
in
charge
of
the
queer
fellow
we
saw
without
his
you
can
see
everything
from

you
very
i
will
go
on
said
prince
wishing
to
rid
himself
of
this
staff
trouble
yourself
the
staff
officer
remained
behind
and
prince
andrew
rode
on
the
farther
forward
and
nearer
the
enemy
he
the
more
orderly
and
cheerful
were
the
the
greatest
disorder
and
depression
had
been
in
the
baggage
train
he
had
passed
that
morning
on
the
znaim
road
seven
miles
away
from
the
at
grunth
also
some
apprehension
and
alarm
could
be
but
the
nearer
prince
andrew
came
to
the
french
lines
the
more
confident
was
the
appearance
of
our
the
soldiers
in
their
greatcoats
were
ranged
in
the
sergeants
major
and
company
officers
were
counting
the
poking
the
last
man
in
each
section
in
the
ribs
and
telling
him
to
hold

it

leaning

made
some
notes
on

was

coming
from

its

was
so
sincere
that

said
a

again
heard

ended
with

into

his

the

of

giving

the
recollection
was
particularly
pleasant
at
that
they
had

been
when

examined
the

he
really
you
frightened

the

he
rode
past

to

from

deafening

in

that
suddenly
surrounded

his

that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
set
fire
to
the

in
reply
to

began
deliberately
to
examine
the

the

to
remark
to
the

if

went

remain
without

bagration
turned
to
the
officer
and
with
his
dull
eyes
looked
at
him
in
it
seemed
to
prince
andrew
that
the
remark
was
just
and
that
really
no
answer
could
be
made
to
but
at
that
moment
an
adjutant
galloped
up
with
a
message
from
the
commander
of
the
regiment
in
the
hollow
and
news
that
immense
masses
of
the
french
were
coming
down
upon
them
and
that
his
regiment
was
in
disorder
and
was
retreating
upon
the

prince
bagration
bowed
his
head
in
sign
of
assent
and
he
rode
off
at
a
walk
to
the
right
and
sent
an
adjutant
to
the
dragoons
with
orders
to
attack
the
but
this
adjutant
returned
half
an
hour
later
with
the
news
that
the
commander
of
the
dragoons
had
already
retreated
beyond
the
dip
in
the
as
a
heavy
fire
had
been
opened
on
him
and
he
was
losing
men
and
so
had
hastened
to
throw
some
sharpshooters
into
the
said
as
he
was
leaving
the
firing
was
heard
on
the
left
and
as
it
was
too
far
to
the
left
flank
for
him
to
have
time
to
go
there
prince
bagration
sent
zherkov
to
tell
the
general
in
command
one
who
had
paraded
his
regiment
before
kutuzov
at
that
he
must
retreat
as
quickly
as
possible
behind
the
hollow
in
the
as
the
right
flank
would
probably
not
be
able
to
withstand
the
attack
very
about
tushin
and
the
battalion
that
had
been
in
support
of
his
battery
all
was
prince
andrew
listened
attentively
to
colloquies
with
the
commanding
officers
and
the
orders
he
gave
them
to
his
found
that
no
orders
were
really
but
that
prince
bagration
tried
to
make
it
appear
that
everything
done
by
by
or
by
the
will
of
subordinate
commanders
was
if
not
by
his
direct
at
least
in
accord
with
his
prince
andrew
that
though
what
happened
was
due
to
chance
and
was
independent
of
the
owing
to
the
tact
bagration
his
presence
was
very
officers
who
approached
him
with
disturbed
countenances
became
soldiers
and
officers
greeted
him
grew
more
cheerful
in
his
and
were
evidently
anxious
to
display
their
courage
before
chapter
xviii
prince
having
reached
the
highest
point
of
our
right
began
riding
downhill
to
where
the
roll
of
musketry
was
heard
but
where
on
account
of
the
smoke
nothing
could
be
the
nearer
they
got
to
the
hollow
the
less
they
could
see
but
the
more
they
felt
the
nearness
of
the
actual
they
began
to
meet
wounded
one
with
a
bleeding
head
and
no
cap
was
being
dragged
along
by
two
soldiers
who
supported
him
under
the
there
was
a
gurgle
in
his
throat
and
he
was
spitting
a
bullet
had
evidently
hit
him
in
the
throat
or
another
was
walking
sturdily
by
himself
but
without
his
groaning
aloud
and
swinging
his
arm
which
had
just
been
while
blood
from
it
was
streaming
over
his
greatcoat
as
from
a
he
had
that
moment
been
wounded
and
his
face
showed
fear
rather
than
crossing
a
road
they
descended
a
steep
incline
and
saw
several
men
lying
on
the
they
also
met
a
crowd
of
soldiers
some
of
whom
were
the
soldiers
were
ascending
the
hill
breathing
and
despite
the
presence
were
talking
loudly
and
in
front
of
them
rows
of
gray
cloaks
were
already
visible
through
the
and
an
officer
catching
sight
of
bagration
rushed
shouting
after
the
crowd
of
retreating
ordering
them
bagration
rode
up
to
the
ranks
along
which
shots
crackled
now
here
and
now
drowning
the
sound
of
voices
and
the
shouts
of
the
whole
air
reeked
with
the
excited
faces
of
the
soldiers
were
blackened
with
some
were
using
their
others
putting
powder
on
the
touchpans
or
taking
charges
from
their
while
others
were
though
who
they
were
firing
at
could
not
be
seen
for
the
smoke
which
there
was
no
wind
to
carry
a
pleasant
humming
and
whistling
of
bullets
were
often
is
thought
prince

approaching
the
crowd
of
be
an
for
they
are
not
it
be
a
they
are
not
drawn
up
for
the
commander
of

a
old
man
with
a
pleasant
eyelids
drooping
more
than
half
over
his
old
giving
him
a
mild
rode
up
to
bagration
and
welcomed
him
as
a
host
welcomes
an
honored
he
reported
that
his
regiment
had
been
attacked
by
french
cavalry
and
though
the
attack
had
been
he
had
lost
more
than
half
his
he
said
the
attack
had
been
employing
this
military
term
to
describe
what
had
occurred
to
his
but
in
reality
he
did
not
himself
know
what
had
happened
during
that
to
the
troops
entrusted
to
and
could
not
say
with
certainty
whether
the
attack
had
been
repulsed
or
his
regiment
had
been
broken
all
he
knew
was
that
at
the
commencement
of
the
action
balls
and
shells
began
flying
all
over
his
regiment
and
hitting
men
and
that
afterwards
someone
had
shouted
and
our
men
had
begun
they
were
still
not
at
the
cavalry
which
had
but
at
french
infantry
who
had
come
into
the
hollow
and
were
firing
at
our
prince
bagration
bowed
his
head
as
a
sign
that
this
was
exactly
what
he
had
desired
and
turning
to
his
adjutant
he
ordered
him
to
bring
down
the
two
battalions
of
the
sixth
chasseurs
whom
they
had
just
prince
andrew
was
struck
by
the
changed
expression
on
prince
face
at
this
it
expressed
the
concentrated
and
happy
resolution
you
see
on
the
face
of
a
man
who
on
a
hot
day
takes
a
final
run
before
plunging
into
the
the
sleepy
expression
was
no
longer
nor
the
affectation
of
profound
the
eyes
looked
before
him
eagerly
and
rather
not
resting
on
anything
although
his
movements
were
still
slow
and
the
commander
of
the
regiment
turned
to
prince
entreating
him
to
go
back
as
it
was
too
dangerous
to
remain
where
they
your
for
he
kept
glancing
for
support
at
an
officer
of
the
suite
who
turned
away
from
you
and
he
drew
attention
to
the
bullets
and
hissing
continually
around
he
spoke
in
the
tone
of
entreaty
and
reproach
that
a
carpenter
uses
to
a
gentleman
who
has
picked
up
an
are
used
to
but
will
blister
your
he
spoke
as
if
those
bullets
could
not
kill
and
his
eyes
gave
still
more
persuasiveness
to
his
the
staff
officer
joined
in
the
but
bagration
did
not
he
only
gave
an
order
to
cease
firing
and
so
as
to
give
room
for
the
two
approaching
while
he
was

curtain
of
smoke
that
had
concealed

by
a
rising

to

from

involuntarily
on

against

winding
down

the

already
descended

take

on

how

would
appear

passed

stepped
lightly
with

as

sailing
stretching
himself
to

without

with

close

at

now
back
at

as
if
all
the
powers

on

from
where
they
had
been

it
had
been
evident
that
it
was
impossible
for

to
act
among
the
bushes
and
broken
as
well
as
that
the
french
were
outflanking
our
the

looked
sternly
and
significantly
at
one
another
like
two
fighting
cocks
preparing
for

there

of

would
have
remained
there
for
a
long
time
testing
each
courage
had
it
not
been

just
then
they
heard
the
rattle
of
musketry
and
a
muffled
shout
almost
behind
them
in
the
the
french
had
attacked
the
men
collecting
wood
in
the
it
was
no
longer
possible
for
the
hussars
to
retreat
with
the
they
were
cut
off
from
the
line
of

on
the

by
the
however
inconvenient
the
it
was
now
necessary
to
attack
in
order
to
cut
a
way
through
for
the
squadron
in
which
rostov
was
serving
had
scarcely
time
to
mount
before
it
was
halted
facing
the
as
at
the
enns
there
was
nothing
between
the
squadron
and
the
and
again
that
terrible
dividing
line
of
uncertainty
and
the
line
separating
the
living
from
the
between
all
were
conscious
of
this
unseen
and
the
question
whether
they
would
cross
it
or
and
how
they
would
cross
agitated
them
the
colonel
rode
to
the
angrily
gave
some
reply
to
questions
put
to
him
by
the
like
a
man
desperately
insisting
on
having
his
own
gave
an
no
one
said
anything
but
the
rumor
of
an
attack
spread
through
the
the
command
to
form
up
rang
out
and
the
sabers
whizzed
as
they
were
drawn
from
their
still
no
one
the
troops
of
the
left
infantry
and
hussars
felt
that
the
commander
did
not
himself
know
what
to
and
this
irresolution
communicated
itself
to
the
only
they
would
be
thought
feeling
that
at
last
the
time
had
come
to
experience
the
joy
of
an
attack
of
which
he
had
so
often
heard
from
his
fellow
with
rang
out
a
twot
the
croups
began
to
sway
in
the
front
rook
pulled
at
the
reins
and
started
of
his
own
before
on
the
rostov
saw
the
front
lines
of
his
hussars
and
still
farther
ahead
a
dark
line
which
he
could
not
see
distinctly
but
took
to
be
the
shots
could
be
but
some
way
came
the
word
of
and
rostov
felt
flanks
drooping
as
he
broke
into
a
rostov
anticipated
his
movements
and
became
more
and
more
he
had
noticed
a
solitary
tree
ahead
of
this
tree
had
been
in
the
middle
of
the
line
that
had
seemed
so
now
he
had
crossed
that
line
and
not
only
was
there
nothing
but
everything
was
becoming
more
and
more
happy
and
how
i
will
slash
at
thought
gripping
the
hilt
of
his
came
a
roar
of
anyone
come
my
way
thought
rostov
driving
his
spurs
into
rook
and
letting
him
go
at
a
full
gallop
so
that
he
outstripped
the
the
enemy
was
already
suddenly
something
like
a
birch
broom
seemed
to
sweep
over
the
rostov
raised
his
ready
to
but
at
that
instant
the
trooper
who
was
galloping
shot
away
from
and
rostov
felt
as
in
a
dream
that
he
continued
to
be
carried
forward
with
unnatural
speed
but
yet
stayed
on
the
same
from
behind
him
an
hussar
he
jolted
against
him
and
looked
angrily
at
horse
swerved
and
galloped
is
it
i
am
not
i
have
i
am
rostov
asked
and
answered
at
the
same
he
was
alone
in
the
middle
of
a
instead
of
the
moving
horses
and
he
saw
nothing
before
him
but
the
motionless
earth
and
the
stubble
around
there
was
warm
blood
under
his
i
am
wounded
and
the
horse
is
rook
tried
to
rise
on
his
forelegs
but
fell
pinning
his
blood
was
flowing
from
his
he
struggled
but
could
not
rostov
also
tried
to
rise
but
fell
his
sabretache
having
become
entangled
in
the
where
our
men
and
where
the
he
did
not
there
was
no
one
having
disentangled
his
he
on
which
was
now
the
line
that
had
so
sharply
divided
the
two
he
asked
himself
and
could
not
something
bad
have
happened
to
he
wondered
as
he
got
and
at
that
moment
he
felt
that
something
superfluous
was
hanging
on
his
benumbed
left
the
wrist
felt
as
if
it
were
not
he
examined
his
hand
vainly
trying
to
find
blood
on
here
are
people
he
thought
seeing
some
men
running
toward
will
help
in
front
came
a
man
wearing
a
strange
shako
and
a
blue
and
with
a
hooked
then
came
two
and
many
more
running
one
of
them
said
something
not
in
in
among
the
hindmost
of
these
men
wearing
similar
shakos
was
a
russian
he
was
being
held
by
the
arms
and
his
horse
was
being
led
behind
must
be
one
of
a
can
it
be
that
they
will
take
me
who
are
these
thought
scarcely
believing
his
they
be
he
looked
at
the
approaching
and
though
but
a
moment
before
he
had
been
galloping
to
get
at
them
and
hack
them
to
their
proximity
now
seemed
so
awful
that
he
could
not
believe
his
are
why
are
they
can
they
be
coming
at
and
to
kill
me
whom
everyone
is
so
fond
he
remembered
his
love
for
and
his
and
his
and
the
intention
to
kill
him
seemed
perhaps
they
may
do
for
more
than
ten
seconds
he
stood
not
moving
from
the
spot
or
realizing
the
the
foremost
the
one
with
the
hooked
was
already
so
close
that
the
expression
of
his
face
could
be
and
the
alien
face
of
that
his
bayonet
hanging
holding
his
and
running
so
frightened
he
seized
his
pistol
instead
of
firing
flung
it
at
the
frenchman
and
ran
with
all
his
might
toward
the
he
did
not
now
run
with
the
feeling
of
doubt
and
conflict
with
which
he
had
trodden
the
enns
but
with
the
feeling
of
a
hare
fleeing
from
the
one
single
that
of
fear
for
his
young
and
happy
possessed
his
whole
rapidly
leaping
the
he
fled
across
the
field
with
the
impetuosity
he
used
to
show
at
now
and
then
turning
his
young
face
to
look
a
shudder
of
terror
went
through
better
not
he
but
having
reached
the
bushes
he
glanced
round
once
the
french
had
fallen
and
just
as
he
looked
round
the
first
man
changed
his
run
to
a
walk
shouted
something
loudly
to
a
comrade
farther
rostov
some
thought
have
wanted
to
kill
but
at
the
same
his
left
arm
felt
as
heavy
as
if
a
weight
were
tied
to
he
could
run
no
the
frenchman
also
stopped
and
took
rostov
closed
his
eyes
and
stooped
one
bullet
and
then
another
whistled
past
he
mustered
his
last
remaining
took
hold
of
his
left
hand
with
his
and
reached
the
behind
these
were
some
russian
chapter
xx
the
infantry
regiments
that
had
been
caught
unawares
in
the
outskirts
of
the
wood
ran
out
of
the
different
companies
getting
and
retreated
as
a
disorderly
one
in
his
uttered
the
senseless
that
is
so
terrible
in
and
that
word
infected
the
whole
crowd
with
a
feeling
of
cut
shouted
the
the
moment
he
heard
the
firing
and
the
cry
from
the
general
realized
that
something
dreadful
had
happened
to
his
and
the
thought
that
an
exemplary
officer
of
many
service
who
had
never
been
to
might
be
held
responsible
at
headquarters
for
negligence
or
inefficiency
so
staggered
him
forgetting
the
recalcitrant
cavalry
his
own
dignity
as
a
and
above
all
quite
forgetting
the
danger
and
all
regard
for
he
clutched
the
crupper
of
his
saddle
spurring
his
galloped
to
the
regiment
under
a
hail
of
bullets
which
fell
but
fortunately
missed
his
one
desire
was
to
know
what
was
happening
and
at
any
cost
or
the
mistake
if
he
had
made
so
that
an
exemplary
officer
of
who
had
never
been
should
not
be
held
to
having
galloped
safely
through
the
he
reached
a
field
behind
the
copse
across
which
our
regardless
of
were
running
and
descending
the
that
moment
of
moral
hesitation
which
decides
the
fate
of
battles
had
would
this
disorderly
crowd
of
soldiers
attend
to
the
voice
of
their
or
would
disregarding
continue
their
despite
his
desperate
shouts
that
used
to
seem
so
terrible
to
the
despite
his
furious
purple
countenance
distorted
out
of
all
likeness
to
his
former
and
the
flourishing
of
his
the
soldiers
all
continued
to
firing
into
the
and
disobeying
the
moral
hesitation
which
decided
the
fate
of
battles
was
evidently
culminating
in
a
the
general
had
a
fit
of
coughing
as
a
result
of
shouting
and
of
the
powder
smoke
and
stopped
in
everything
seemed
but
at
that
moment
the
french
who
were
suddenly
and
without
any
apparent
ran
back
and
disappeared
from
the
and
russian
sharpshooters
showed
themselves
in
the

was
which
alone

maintained
its
order
in

lain
in

drunken
determination
taken
by
the
french

thrown
down
their
muskets
and
running
beside
killed
a
frenchman
at
close
quarters
and
was
the
first
to
seize
the
surrendering
french
officer
by
his
our
fugitives
the
battalions
and
the
french
who
had
nearly
cut
our
left
flank
in
half
were
for
the
moment
our
reserve
units
were
able
to
join
and
the
fight
was
at
an
the
regimental
commander
and
major
ekonomov
had
stopped
beside
a
letting
the
retreating
companies
pass
by
when
a
soldier
came
up
and
took
hold
of
the

leaning
against

wearing
a
bluish
coat
of

had
no

or
his
head

over
his
shoulder
a
french
munition
pouch

had
an
sword
in
his
the
soldier
was
his
blue
eyes
looked
impudently
into
the
and
his
lips
were
though
the
commander
was
occupied
in
giving
instructions
to
major
he
could
not
help
taking
notice
of
the

said
pointing
to

from

the
and
turned
to

but
dolokhov
did
not

untied

around

it
and
showed

congealed
on

remained
at

your

been
forgotten
and
only
at
the
very
end
of
the
action
did
prince
still
hearing
the
cannonade
in
the
send
his
orderly
staff
and
later
prince
andrew
to
order
the
battery
to
retire
as
quickly
as
when
the
supports
attached
to

had
been
moved
away
in
the
middle
of
the
action
by
the
battery
had
continued
firing
and
was
only
not
captured
by
the
french
because
the
enemy
could
not
surmise
that
anyone
could
have
the
effrontery
to
continue
firing
from
four
quite
undefended
on
the
the
energetic
action
of
that
battery
led
the
french
to
suppose
that
the
main
russian
forces
were
twice
they
had
attempted
to
attack
this
but
on
each
occasion
had
been
driven
back
by
grapeshot
from

isolated
guns

after

but
as
though
in
revenge
for
this
the
enemy
placed
ten
guns
to
the
right
of
the
village
and
began
firing
them
at
in
their
childlike
aroused
by
the
fire
and
their
luck
in
successfully
cannonading
the
our
artillerymen
only
noticed
this
battery
when
two
and
then
four
fell
among

knocking
over
two
horses
and
another
tearing
off

roused

were
carried

four
guns
were
turned
against
the
companion
officer

been
killed
at
the
beginning
of
the
engagement
and
within
an
hour
seventeen
of
the
forty
men
of
the
crews
had
been
but
the
artillerymen
were
still
as
merry
and
lively
as
twice
they
noticed
the
french
appearing
below
and
then
they
fired
grapeshot
at
little
moving
feebly
and
kept
telling
his
orderly
to
my
pipe
for
that
and
scattering
sparks
from
ran
forward
shading
his
eyes
with
his
small
hand
to
look
at
the
at
he
kept
seizing
the
guns
by
the
wheels
and
working
the
screws
amid
the
deafened
by
the
incessant
reports
which
always
made
him
tushin
not
taking
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
ran
from
gun
to
now
now
counting
the
now
giving
orders
about
replacing
dead
or
wounded
horses
and
harnessing
fresh
and
shouting
in
his
feeble
so
high
pitched
and
his
face
grew
more
and
more
only
when
a
man
was
killed
or
wounded
did
he
frown
and
turn
away
from
the
shouting
angrily
at
the
men
as
is
always
the
hesitated
about
lifting
the
injured
or
the
for
the
most
part
handsome
fellows
as
is
always
the
case
in
an
artillery
a
head
and
shoulders
taller
and
twice
as
broad
as
their
looked
at
their
commander
like
children
in
an
embarrassing
and
the
expression
on
his
face
was
invariably
reflected
on
owing
to
the
terrible
uproar
and
the
necessity
for
concentration
and
tushin
did
not
experience
the
slightest
unpleasant
sense
of
and
the
thought
that
he
might
be
killed
or
badly
wounded
never
occurred
to
on
the
he
became
more
and
more
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
was
a
very
long
time
almost
a
since
he
had
first
seen
the
enemy
and
fired
the
first
and
that
the
corner
of
the
field
he
stood
on
was
and
familiar
though
he
thought
of
considered
and
did
everything
the
best
of
officers
could
do
in
his
he
was
in
a
state
akin
to
feverish
delirium
or
from
the
deafening
sounds
of
his
own
guns
around
the
whistle
and
thud
of
the
cannon
from
the
flushed
and
perspiring
faces
of
the
crew
bustling
round
the
from
the
sight
of
the
blood
of
men
and
from
the
little
puffs
of
smoke
on
the
side
followed
by
a
ball
flying
past
and
striking
the
a
a
a
from
the
sight
of
all
these
things
a
fantastic
world
of
his
own
had
taken
possession
of
his
brain
and
at
that
moment
afforded
him
the
guns
were
in
his
fancy
not
guns
but
pipes
from
which
occasional
puffs
were
blown
by
an
invisible
puffing
muttered
tushin
to
as
a
small
cloud
rose
from
the
hill
and
was
borne
in
a
streak
to
the
left
by
the
look
out
for
the

it
do
you
your
asked
an
standing
close
who
heard
him
only
a

our
he
said
to
was
the
name
his
fancy
gave
to
the
farthest
gun
of
the
which
was
large
and
of
an
old
the
french
swarming
round
their
guns
seemed
to
him
like
in
that
the
handsome
drunkard
number
one
of
the
second
crew
was
tushin
looked
at
him
more
often
than
at
anyone
else
and
took
delight
in
his
every
the
sound
of
musketry
at
the
foot
of
the
now
now
seemed
like
he
listened
intently
to
the
ebb
and
flow
of
these
daughter
of
breathing
he
muttered
to
he
imagined
himself
as
an
enormously
powerful
man
who
was
throwing
cannon
balls
at
the
french
with
both
dear
old
let
me
he
was
saying
as
he
moved
from
the
when
a
unfamiliar
voice
called
above
his
tushin
turned
round
in
it
was
the
staff
officer
who
had
turned
him
out
of
the
booth
at
he
was
shouting
in
a
gasping
you
you
have
twice
been
ordered
to
and
are
they
down
on
thought
looking
in
alarm
at
his
he
holding
up
two
fingers
to
his
but
the
staff
officer
did
not
finish
what
he
wanted
to
a
cannon
flying
close
to
caused
him
to
duck
and
bend
over
his
he
and
just
as
he
was
about
to
say
something
another
ball
stopped
he
turned
his
horse
and
galloped
all
to
he
shouted
from
a
the
soldiers
a
moment
an
adjutant
arrived
with
the
same
it
was
prince
the
first
thing
he
saw
on
riding
up
to
the
space
where
guns
were
stationed
was
an
unharnessed
horse
with
a
broken
that
lay
screaming
piteously
beside
the
harnessed
blood
was
gushing
from
its
leg
as
from
a
among
the
limbers
lay
several
dead
one
ball
after
another
passed
over
as
he
approached
and
he
felt
a
nervous
shudder
run
down
his
but
the
mere
thought
of
being
afraid
roused
him
cannot
be
thought
and
dismounted
slowly
among
the
he
delivered
the
order
and
did
not
leave
the
he
decided
to
have
the
guns
removed
from
their
positions
and
withdrawn
in
his
together
with
stepping
across
the
bodies
and
under
a
terrible
fire
from
the
he
attended
to
the
removal
of
the

officer
was
here
a
minute
but
skipped
said
an
artilleryman
to
prince
like
your
prince
andrew
said
nothing
to
they
were
both
so
busy
as
to
seem
not
to
notice
one
when
having
limbered
up
the
only
two
cannon
that
remained
uninjured
out
of
the
they
began
moving
down
the
hill

and
one

left
prince
andrew
rode
up
to

my

for
some
unknown
reason
tears
suddenly
filled
his

wind
had
fallen
and
black
merging
with
the
powder
hung
low
over
the
field
of
battle
on
the
it
was
growing
dark
and
the
glow
of
two
conflagrations
was
the
more
the
cannonade
was
dying
but
the
rattle
of
musketry
behind
and
on
the
right
sounded
oftener
and
as
soon
as
tushin
with
his
continually
driving
round
or
coming
upon
wounded
was
out
of
range
of
fire
and
had
descended
into
the
he
was
met
by
some
of
the
among

who
had
been
twice
sent
to

but
had
never
reached

all
and
orders
as
to
how
to
reprimanding
and
reproaching
tushin
gave
no
fearing
to
speak
because
at
every
word
he
felt
ready
to
weep
without
knowing
behind
on
his
artillery
though
the
orders
were
to
abandon
the
many
of
them
dragged
themselves
after
troops
and
begged
for
seats
on
the
gun
the
jaunty
infantry
officer
who
just
before
the
battle
had
rushed
out
of

and
his

was
placed
on
the
gun
from
which
they
had
removed
the
dead
the
cloak
they
spread
under
him
was
wet
with
blood
which
stained
his
breeches
and

the
wiping
away
the
blood
with
his
coat
as
if
apologizing
for
the
state
of
his
it
was
all
that
they
could
do
to
get
the
guns
up
the
rise
aided
by
the
and
having
reached
the
village
of
gruntersdorf
they
it
had
grown
so
dark
that
one
could
not
distinguish
the
uniforms
ten
paces
and
the
firing
had
begun
to
near
by
on
the
shouting
and
firing
were
again
flashes
of
shot
gleamed
in
the
this
was
the
last
french
attack
and
was
met
by
soldiers
who
had
sheltered
in
the
village
they
all
rushed
out
of
the
village
but
guns
could
not
and
the
and
the
cadet
exchanged
silent
glances
as
they
awaited
their
the
firing
died
down
and
talking
streamed
out
of
a
side
asked
given
it
they
make
another
push
said
see
a
how
they
shot
at
their
own
nothing
could
be
there
something
to
the
french
had
been
repulsed
for
the
last
and
again
and
again
in
the
complete
darkness
guns
moved
surrounded
by
the
humming
infantry
as
by
a
in
the
it
seemed
as
though
a
gloomy
unseen
river
was
flowing
always
in
one
humming
with
whispers
and
talk
and
the
sound
of
hoofs
and
amid
the
general
the
groans
and
voices
of
the
wounded
were
more
distinctly
heard
than
any
other
sound
in
the
darkness
of
the
the
gloom
that
enveloped
the
army
was
filled
with
their
which
seemed
to
melt
into
one
with
the
darkness
of
the
after
a
while
the
moving
mass
became
someone
rode
past
on
a
white
horse
followed
by
his
and
said
something
in
did
he
where
is
did
he
thank
came
eager
questions
from
all
the
whole
moving
mass
began
pressing
closer
together
and
a
report
spread
that
they
were
ordered
to
evidently
those
in
front
had
all
remained
where
they
were
in
the
middle
of
the
muddy
fires
were
lighted
and
the
talk
became
more

given
orders
to

a
soldier
to
find
a
dressing
station
or
a
doctor
for

sat
down
by
a
bonfire
the
soldiers
had
kindled
on
the
dragged
himself
to
the
from
and
a
feverish
shivering
shook
his
whole
drowsiness
was
irresistibly
mastering
but
he
kept
awake
by
an
excruciating
pain
in
his
for
which
he
could
find
no
satisfactory
he
kept
closing
his
eyes
and
then
again
looking
at
the
which
seemed
to
him
dazzlingly
and
at
the
figure
of
tushin
who
was
sitting
like
a
turk
beside
intelligent
eyes
were
fixed
with
sympathy
and
commiseration
on
who
saw
that
tushin
with
his
whole
heart
wished
to
help
him
but
could
from
all
sides
were
heard
the
footsteps
and
talk
of
the
who
were
driving
and
settling
down
all
the
sound
of
the
tramping
the
hoofs
moving
in
the
crackling
of
wood
fires
near
and
merged
into
one
tremulous
it
was
no
as
a
unseen
river
flowing
through
the
but
a
dark
sea
swelling
and
gradually
subsiding
after
a
rostov
looked
at
and
listened
listlessly
to
what
passed
before
and
around
an
infantryman
came
to
the
squatted
on
his
held
his
hands
to
the
and
turned
away
his
mind
your
he
asked
lost
my
your
i
know
such
bad
with
the
an
infantry
officer
with
a
bandaged
cheek
came
up
to
the
and
addressing
tushin
asked
him
to
have
the
guns
moved
a
trifle
to
let
a
wagon
go
after
he
had
two
soldiers
rushed
to
the
they
were
quarreling
and
fighting
each
trying
to
snatch
from
the
other
a
boot
they
were
both
holding
on
picked
it
i
dare
very
one
of
them
shouted
then
a
pale
his
neck
bandaged
with
a
bloodstained
leg
came
up
and
in
angry
tones
asked
the
artillerymen
for
one
die
like
a
said
tushin
told
them
to
give
the
man
some
then
a
cheerful
soldier
ran
begging
a
little
fire
for
the
nice
little
hot
torch
for
the
good
luck
to
fellow
thanks
for
the
return
it
with
said
carrying
away
into
the
darkness
a
glowing
next
came
four
carrying
something
heavy
on
a
and
passed
by
the
one
of
them
the
devil
has
put
the
logs
on
the
snarled
carry
said
and
they
disappeared
into
the
darkness
with
their
tushin
asked
rostov
in
a
wanted
by
the
he
is
in
the
hut
said
a
coming
up
to
tushin
rose
buttoning
his
greatcoat
and
pulling
it
walked
away
from
the
not
far
from
the
artillery
in
a
hut
that
had
been
prepared
for
prince
bagration
sat
at
talking
with
some
commanding
officers
who
had
gathered
at
his
the
little
old
man
with
the
eyes
was
there
greedily
gnawing
a
mutton
and
the

who
had
served
blamelessly
for

by
a
glass
of
vodka
and
the
and
the
staff
officer
with
the
signet
and
uneasily
glancing
at
them
and
prince
with
compressed
lips
and
feverishly
glittering
in
a
corner
of
the
hut
stood
a
standard
captured
from
the
and
the
accountant
with
the
naive
face
was
feeling
its
shaking
his
head
in
because
the
banner
really
interested
perhaps
because
it
was
hard
for
hungry
as
he
to
look
on
at
a
dinner
where
there
was
no
place
for
in
the
next
hut
there
was
a
french
colonel
who
had
been
taken
prisoner
by
our

officers

flocking
in
to
look
at

thanking
the
individual
commanders
and
inquiring
into
details
of
the
action
and
our
the
general
whose
regiment
had
been
inspected
at
braunau
was
informing
the
prince
that
as
soon
as
the
action
began
he
had
withdrawn
from
the
mustered
the
men
who
were
allowing
the
french
to
pass

made
a
bayonet
charge
with
two
battalions
and
had
broken
up
the
french

their
first
battalion
was
i
stopped
in
the
road
and
let
them
come
on
and
will
meet
them
with
the
fire
of
the
whole
what
i
the
general
had
so
wished
to
do
this
and
was
so
sorry
he
had
not
managed
to
do
it
that
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
it
had
really
perhaps
it
might
really
have
been
could
one
possibly
make
out
amid
all
that
confusion
what
did
or
did
not

your

should
inform

remembering
conversation
with
kutuzov
and
his
last
interview
with
the
private

uneasily

that
but

heard
about
them
from
an

up
two
your
several
of
those

at
expecting
one
of
his
usual
but
noticing
that
what
he
was
saying
redounded
to
the
glory
of
our
arms
and
of
the
they
assumed
a
serious
though
many
of
them
knew
that
what
he
was
saying
was
a
lie
devoid
of
any

turned
to
the
old
i
thank
you
all
arms
have
behaved
and
how
was
it
that
two
guns
were
abandoned
in
the
he
searching
with
his
eyes
for
bagration
did
not
ask
about
the
guns
on
the
left
he
knew
that
all
the
guns
there
had
been
abandoned
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
think
i
sent

turning
to
the
staff
officer
on
was
answered
the
staff
the
other
i
i
was
there
all
the
time
giving
orders
and
had
only
just
it
is
true
that
it
was
hot
he
someone
mentioned
that
captain
tushin
was
bivouacking
close
to
the
village
and
had
already
been
sent
but
you
were
said
prince
addressing
prince
we
only
just
missed
one
said
the
staff
with
a
smile
to
had
not
the
pleasure
of
seeing
said
prince
coldly
and
all
were
tushin
appeared
at
the
threshold
and
made
his
way
timidly
from
behind
the
backs
of
the
as
he
stepped
past
the
generals
in
the
crowded
feeling
embarrassed
as
he
always
was
by
the
sight
of
his
he
did
not
notice
the
staff
of
the
banner
and
stumbled
over
several
of
those
present
was
it
a
gun
was
asked
not
so
much
at
the
captain
as
at
those
who
were
among
whom
zherkov
laughed
only
when
he
was
confronted
by
the
stern
did
his
guilt
and
the
disgrace
of
having
lost
two
guns
and
yet
remaining
alive
present
themselves
to
tushin
in
all
their
he
had
been
so
excited
that
he
had
not
thought
about
it
until
that
the
laughter
confused
him
still
he
stood
before
bagration
with
his
lower
jaw
trembling
and
was
hardly
able
to
your
i
had
no
your
might
have
taken
some
from
the
covering
tushin
did
not
say
that
there
were
no
covering
though
that
was
perfectly
he
was
afraid
of
getting
some
other
officer
into
and
silently
fixed
his
eyes
on
bagration
as
a
schoolboy
who
has
blundered
looks
at
an
the
silence
lasted
some
prince
apparently
not
wishing
to
be
found
nothing
to
the
others
did
not
venture
to
prince
andrew
looked
at
tushin
from
under
his
brows
and
his
fingers
twitched
prince
andrew
broke
the
silence
with
his
abrupt
were
pleased
to
send
me
to
captain
i
went
there
and
found
two
thirds
of
the
men
and
horses
knocked
two
guns
and
no
supports
at
prince
bagration
and
tushin
looked
with
equal
intentness
at
who
spoke
with
suppressed
if
your
excellency
will
allow
me
to
express
my
he
owe
success
chiefly
to
the
action
of
that
battery
and
the
heroic
endurance
of
captain
tushin
and
his
and
without
awaiting
a
prince
andrew
rose
and
left
the
prince

looked
at
evidently
reluctant
to
show
distrust
in
emphatic
opinion
yet
not
feeling
able
fully
to
credit
bent
his
and
told
tushin
that
he
could

went
out
with
you

my
dear
said
prince
andrew
gave
him
a
but
said
nothing
and
went
he
felt
sad
and
it
was
all
so
so
unlike
what
he
had
are
why
are
they
what
do
they
and
when
will
all
this
thought
looking
at
the
changing
shadows
before
the
pain
in
his
arm
became
more
and
more
irresistible
drowsiness
overpowered
red
rings
danced
before
his
and
the
impression
of
those
voices
and
faces
and
a
sense
of
loneliness
merged
with
the
physical
it
was
these
and
was
they
who
were
weighing
and
twisting
the
sinews
and
scorching
the
flesh
of
his
sprained
arm
and
to
rid
himself
of
them
he
closed
his
for
a
moment
he
but
in
that
short
interval
innumerable
things
appeared
to
him
in
a
his
mother
and
her
large
white
thin
little
eyes
and
denisov
with
his
voice
and
and
telyanin
and
all
that
affair
with
telyanin
and
that
affair
was
the
same
thing
as
this
soldier
with
the
harsh
and
it
was
that
affair
and
this
soldier
that
were
so
incessantly
pulling
and
pressing
his
arm
and
always
dragging
it
in
one
he
tried
to
get
away
from
but
they
would
not
for
an
instant
let
his
shoulder
move
a
it
would
not
would
be
only
they
did
not
pull
but
it
was
impossible
to
get
rid
of
he
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
the
black
canopy
of
night
hung
less
than
a
yard
above
the
glow
of
the
flakes
of
falling
snow
were
fluttering
in
that
tushin
had
not
the
doctor
had
not
he
was
alone
except
for
a
soldier
who
was
sitting
naked
at
the
other
side
of
the
warming
his
thin
yellow
wants
thought
is
no
one
to
help
me
or
pity
yet
i
was
once
at
and
he
sighed
doing
groaned
is
anything
hurting
asked
the
shaking
his
shirt
out
over
the
and
not
waiting
for
an
answer
he
gave
a
grunt
and
a
lot
of
men
have
been
crippled
rostov
did
not
listen
to
the
he
looked
at
the
snowflakes
fluttering
above
the
fire
and
remembered
a
russian
winter
at
his
bright
his
fluffy
fur
his
quickly
gliding
his
healthy
and
all
the
affection
and
care
of
his
why
did
i
come
he
next
day
the
french
army
did
not
renew
their
and
the
remnant
of
detachment
was
reunited
to

chapter
i
prince
vasili
was
not
a
man
who
deliberately
thought
out
his
still
less
did
he
think
of
injuring
anyone
for
his
own
he
was
merely
a
man
of
the
world
who
had
got
on
and
to
whom
getting
on
had
become
a
schemes
and
devices
for
which
he
never
rightly
accounted
to
but
which
formed
the
whole
interest
of
his
were
constantly
shaping
themselves
in
his
arising
from
the
circumstances
and
persons
he
of
these
plans
he
had
not
merely
one
or
two
in
his
head
but
some
only
beginning
to
form
some
approaching
and
some
in
course
of
he
did
for
say
to
man
now
has
i
must
gain
his
confidence
and
friendship
and
through
him
obtain
a
special
nor
did
he
say
to
is
a
rich
i
must
entice
him
to
marry
my
daughter
and
lend
me
the
forty
thousand
rubles
i
but
when
he
came
across
a
man
of
position
his
instinct
immediately
told
him
that
this
man
could
be
and
without
any
premeditation
prince
vasili
took
the
first
opportunity
to
gain
his
flatter
become
intimate
with
and
finally
make
his
he
had
pierre
at
hand
in
moscow
and
procured
for
him
an
appointment
as
gentleman
of
the
which
at
that
time
conferred
the
status
of
councilor
of
and
insisted
on
the
young
man
accompanying
him
to
petersburg
and
staying
at
his
with
apparent
yet
with
unhesitating
assurance
that
he
was
doing
the
right
prince
vasili
did
everything
to
get
pierre
to
marry
his
had
he
thought
out
his
plans
beforehand
he
could
not
have
been
so
natural
and
shown
such
unaffected
familiarity
in
intercourse
with
everybody
both
above
and
below
him
in
social
something
always
drew
him
toward
those
richer
and
more
powerful
than
himself
and
he
had
rare
skill
in
seizing
the
most
opportune
moment
for
making
use
of
on
unexpectedly
becoming
count
bezukhov
and
a
rich
felt
himself
after
his
recent
loneliness
and
freedom
from
cares
so
beset
and
preoccupied
that
only
in
bed
was
he
able
to
be
by
he
had
to
sign
to
present
himself
at
government
the
purpose
of
which
was
not
clear
to
to
question
his
chief
to
visit
his
estate
near
and
to
receive
many
people
who
formerly
did
not
even
wish
to
know
of
his
existence
but
would
now
have
been
offended
and
grieved
had
he
chosen
not
to
see
these
different
and
acquaintances
all
disposed
to
treat
the
young
heir
in
the
most
friendly
and
flattering
they
were
all
evidently
firmly
convinced
of
noble
he
was
always
hearing
such
words
your
remarkable
your
excellent
are
yourself
so
honorable
he
as
clever
as
and
so
till
he
began
sincerely
to
believe
in
his
own
exceptional
kindness
and
extraordinary
the
more
so
as
in
the
depth
of
his
heart
it
had
always
seemed
to
him
that
he
really
was
very
kind
and
even
people
who
had
formerly
been
spiteful
toward
him
and
evidently
unfriendly
now
became
gentle
and
the
angry
eldest
with
the
long
waist
and
hair
plastered
down
like
a
had
come
into
room
after
the
with
drooping
eyes
and
frequent
blushes
she
told
him
she
was
very
sorry
about
their
past
misunderstandings
and
did
not
now
feel
she
had
a
right
to
ask
him
for
except
only
for
after
the
blow
she
had
to
remain
for
a
few
weeks
longer
in
the
house
she
so
loved
and
where
she
had
sacrificed
so
she
could
not
refrain
from
weeping
at
these
touched
that
this
statuesque
princess
could
so
pierre
took
her
hand
and
begged
her
without
knowing
what
from
that
day
the
eldest
princess
quite
changed
toward
pierre
and
began
knitting
a
striped
scarf
for
this
for
my
mon
after
she
had
to
put
up
with
a
great
deal
from
the
said
prince
vasili
to
handing
him
a
deed
to
sign
for
the
prince
vasili
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
necessary
to
throw
this
bill
for
thirty
thousand
the
poor
princess
that
it
might
not
occur
to
her
to
speak
of
his
share
in
the
affair
of
the
inlaid
pierre
signed
the
deed
and
after
that
the
princess
grew
still
the
younger
sisters
also
became
affectionate
to
especially
the
the
pretty
one
with
the
who
often
made
him
feel
confused
by
her
smiles
and
her
own
confusion
when
meeting
it
seemed
so
natural
to
pierre
that
everyone
should
like
and
it
would
have
seemed
so
unnatural
had
anyone
disliked
that
he
could
not
but
believe
in
the
sincerity
of
those
around
he
had
no
time
to
ask
himself
whether
these
people
were
sincere
or
he
was
always
busy
and
always
felt
in
a
state
of
mild
and
cheerful
he
felt
as
though
he
were
the
center
of
some
important
and
general
that
something
was
constantly
expected
of
that
if
he
did
not
do
it
he
would
grieve
and
disappoint
many
but
if
he
did
this
and
all
would
be
and
he
did
what
was
demanded
of
but
still
that
happy
result
always
remained
in
the
more
than
anyone
prince
vasili
took
possession
of
affairs
and
of
pierre
himself
in
those
early
from
the
death
of
count
bezukhov
he
did
not
let
go
his
hold
of
the
he
had
the
air
of
a
man
oppressed
by
weary
and
who
yet
would
for
leave
this
helpless
youth
after
was
the
son
of
his
old
friend
and
the
possessor
of
such
enormous
to
the
caprice
of
fate
and
the
designs
of
during
the
few
days
he
spent
in
moscow
after
the
death
of
count
he
would
call
or
go
to
him
and
tell
him
what
ought
to
be
done
in
a
tone
of
weariness
and
as
if
he
were
adding
every
know
i
am
overwhelmed
with
business
and
it
is
purely
out
of
charity
that
i
trouble
myself
about
and
you
also
know
quite
well
that
what
i
propose
is
the
only
thing
my
dear
tomorrow
we
are
off
at
said
prince
vasili
one
closing
his
eyes
and
fingering
speaking
as
if
he
were
saying
something
which
had
long
since
been
agreed
upon
and
could
not
now
be
start
tomorrow
and
giving
you
a
place

my

something
i
have
received
from
the
i
asked
him
for
and
you
have
been
entered
in
the
diplomatic
corps
and
made
a
gentleman
of
the
the
diplomatic
career
now
lies
open
before
notwithstanding
the
tone
of
wearied
assurance
with
which
these
words
were
who
had
so
long
been
considering
his
wished
to
make
some
but
prince
vasili
interrupted
him
in
the
special
deep
cooing
precluding
the
possibility
of
interrupting
his
which
he
used
in
extreme
cases
when
special
persuasion
was
mon
i
did
this
for
my
own
to
satisfy
my
and
there
is
nothing
to
thank
me
no
one
has
ever
complained
yet
of
being
too
much
and
you

from
the
ryazan
prince
vasili
meant
several
thousand
rubles
quitrent
received
from
which
the
prince
had
retained
for
in
as
in
pierre
found
the
same
atmosphere
of
gentleness
and
he
could
not
refuse
the
or
rather
the
rank
he
did
that
prince
vasili
had
procured
for
and
and
social
occupations
were
so
numerous
even
more
than
in
he
felt
a
sense
of
and
continual
expectation
of
some
always
in
front
of
him
but
never
of
his
former
bachelor
acquaintances
many
were
no
longer
in
the
guards
had
gone
to
the
dolokhov
had
been
reduced
to
the
anatole
was
in
the
army
somewhere
in
the
prince
andrew
was
so
pierre
had
not
the
opportunity
to
spend
his
nights
as
he
used
to
like
to
spend
or
to
open
his
mind
by
intimate
talks
with
a
friend
older
than
himself
and
whom
he
his
whole
time
was
taken
up
with
dinners
and
balls
and
was
spent
chiefly
at
prince
house
in
the
company
of
the
stout
his
and
his
beautiful
daughter
like
the
anna
pavlovna
scherer
showed
pierre
the
change
of
attitude
toward
him
that
had
taken
place
in
formerly
in
anna
pierre
had
always
felt
that
what
he
was
saying
was
out
of
tactless
and
that
remarks
which
seemed
to
him
clever
while
they
formed
in
his
mind
became
foolish
as
soon
as
he
uttered
while
on
the
contrary
stupidest
remarks
came
out
clever
and
now
everything
pierre
said
was
even
if
anna
pavlovna
did
not
say
he
could
see
that
she
wished
to
and
only
refrained
out
of
regard
for
his
in
the
beginning
of
the
winter
of
pierre
received
one
of
anna
usual
pink
notes
with
an
invitation
to
which
was
will
find
the
beautiful
helene
whom
it
is
always
delightful
to
when
he
read
that
pierre
felt
for
the
first
time
that
some
link
which
other
people
recognized
had
grown
up
between
himself
and
and
that
thought
both
alarmed
as
if
some
obligation
were
being
imposed
on
him
which
he
could
not
and
pleased
him
as
an
entertaining
anna
was
like
the
former
only
the
novelty
she
offered
her
guests
this
time
was
not
but
a
diplomatist
fresh
from
berlin
with
the
very
latest
details
of
the
emperor
visit
to
and
of
how
the
two
august
friends
had
pledged
themselves
in
an
indissoluble
alliance
to
uphold
the
cause
of
justice
against
the
enemy
of
the
human
anna
pavlovna
received
pierre
with
a
shade
of
evidently
relating
to
the
young
recent
loss
by
the
death
of
count
bezukhov
constantly
considered
it
a
duty
to
assure
pierre
that
he
was
greatly
afflicted
by
the
death
of
the
father
he
had
hardly
and
her
melancholy
was
just
like
the
august
melancholy
she
showed
at
the
mention
of
her
most
august
majesty
the
empress
marya
pierre
felt
flattered
by
anna
pavlovna
arranged
the
different
groups
in
her
drawing
room
with
her
habitual
the
large
in
which
were
prince
vasili
and
the
had
the
benefit
of
the
another
group
was
at
the
tea
pierre
wished
to
join
the
but
anna
was
in
the
excited
condition
of
a
commander
on
a
battlefield
to
whom
thousands
of
new
and
brilliant
ideas
occur
which
there
is
hardly
time
to
put
in
touched
his
sleeve
with
her
a
i
have
something
in
view
for
you
this
glanced
at
helene
and
smiled
at
dear
be
charitable
to
my
poor
aunt
who
adores
go
and
keep
her
company
for
ten
and
that
it
will
not
be
too
here
is
the
dear
count
who
will
not
refuse
to
accompany
the
beauty
went
to
the
but
anna
pavlovna
detained
looking
as
if
she
had
to
give
some
final
necessary
she
she
said
to
pointing
to
the
stately
beauty
as
she
glided
how
she
carries
for
so
young
a
such
such
masterly
perfection
of
it
comes
from
her
happy
the
man
who
wins
with
her
the
least
worldly
of
men
would
occupy
a
most
brilliant
position
in
you
think
i
only
wanted
to
know
your
and
anna
pavlovna
let
pierre
in
sincerely
agreed
with
her
as
to
perfection
of
if
he
ever
thought
of
it
was
just
of
her
beauty
and
her
remarkable
skill
in
appearing
silently
dignified
in
the
old
aunt
received
the
two
young
people
in
her
but
seemed
desirous
of
hiding
her
adoration
for
helene
and
inclined
rather
to
show
her
fear
of
anna
she
looked
at
her
as
if
inquiring
what
she
was
to
do
with
these
on
leaving
anna
pavlovna
again
touched
hope
you
say
that
it
is
dull
in
my
house
and
she
glanced
at
helene
with
a
look
implying
that
she
did
not
admit
the
possibility
of
anyone
seeing
her
without
being
the
aunt
and
said
in
french
that
she
was
very
pleased
to
see
then
she
turned
to
pierre
with
the
same
words
of
welcome
and
the
same
in
the
middle
of
a
dull
and
halting
helene
turned
to
pierre
with
the
beautiful
bright
smile
that
she
gave
to
pierre
was
so
used
to
that
and
it
had
so
little
meaning
for
that
he
paid
no
attention
to
the
aunt
was
just
speaking
of
a
collection
of
snuffboxes
that
had
belonged
to
count
and
showed
them
her
own
princess
helene
asked
to
see
the
portrait
of
the
husband
on
the
box
is
probably
the
work
of
said
mentioning
a
celebrated
and
he
leaned
over
the
table
to
take
the
snuffbox
while
trying
to
hear
what
was
being
said
at
the
other
he
half
meaning
to
go
but
the
aunt
handed
him
the
passing
it
across
helene
stooped
forward
to
make
and
looked
round
with
a
she
as
always
at
evening
wearing
a
dress
such
as
was
then
cut
very
low
at
front
and
her
which
had
always
seemed
like
marble
to
was
so
close
to
him
that
his
shortsighted
eyes
could
not
but
perceive
the
living
charm
of
her
neck
and
so
near
to
his
lips
that
he
need
only
have
bent
his
head
a
little
to
have
touched
he
was
conscious
of
the
warmth
of
her
the
scent
of
and
the
creaking
of
her
corset
as
she
he
did
not
see
her
marble
beauty
forming
a
complete
whole
with
her
but
all
the
charm
of
her
body
only
covered
by
her
and
having
once
seen
this
he
could
not
help
being
aware
of
just
as
we
cannot
renew
an
illusion
we
have
once
seen
you
have
never
noticed
before
how
beautiful
i
helene
seemed
to
had
not
noticed
that
i
am
a
i
am
a
woman
who
may
belong
to
you
said
her
and
at
that
moment
pierre
felt
that
helene
not
only
but
be
his
and
that
it
could
not
be
he
knew
this
at
that
moment
as
surely
as
if
he
had
been
standing
at
the
altar
with
how
and
when
this
would
be
he
did
not
he
did
not
even
know
if
it
would
be
a
good
thing
even
he
knew
not
that
it
would
be
a
bad
but
he
knew
it
would
pierre
dropped
his
lifted
them
and
wished
once
more
to
see
her
as
a
distant
beauty
far
removed
from
as
he
had
seen
her
every
day
until
but
he
could
no
longer
do
he
could
any
more
than
a
man
who
has
been
looking
at
a
tuft
of
steppe
grass
through
the
mist
and
taking
it
for
a
tree
can
again
take
it
for
a
tree
after
he
has
once
recognized
it
to
be
a
tuft
of
she
was
terribly
close
to
she
already
had
power
over
and
between
them
there
was
no
longer
any
barrier
except
the
barrier
of
his
own
i
will
leave
you
in
your
little
came
anna
see
you
are
all
right
and
anxiously
trying
to
remember
whether
he
had
done
anything
looked
round
with
a
it
seemed
to
him
that
everyone
knew
what
had
happened
to
him
as
he
knew
it
a
little
later
when
he
went
up
to
the
large
anna
pavlovna
said
to
hear
you
are
refitting
your
petersburg
this
was
the
architect
had
told
him
that
it
was
and
without
knowing
was
having
his
enormous
petersburg
house
done
a
good
but
move
from
prince
it
is
good
to
have
a
friend
like
the
she
smiling
at
prince
know
something
about
and
you
are
still
so
you
need
be
angry
with
me
for
exercising
an
old
she
as
women
always
expecting
something
after
they
have
mentioned
their
you
marry
it
will
be
a
different
she
uniting
them
both
in
one
pierre
did
not
look
at
helene
nor
she
at
but
she
was
just
as
terribly
close
to
he
muttered
something
and
when
he
got
home
he
could
not
sleep
for
a
long
time
for
thinking
of
what
had
what
had
he
had
merely
understood
that
the
woman
he
had
known
as
a
of
whom
when
her
beauty
was
mentioned
he
had
said
good
he
had
understood
that
this
woman
might
belong
to
i
have
myself
said
she
is
he
is
something
something
in
the
feeling
she
excites
in
i
have
been
told
that
her
brother
anatole
was
in
love
with
her
and
she
with
that
there
was
quite
a
scandal
and
that
why
he
was
sent
hippolyte
is
her
prince
vasili
is
her
he
but
while
he
was
thinking
this
reflection
was
still
he
caught
himself
smiling
and
was
conscious
that
another
line
of
thought
had
sprung
and
while
thinking
of
her
worthlessness
he
was
also
dreaming
of
how
she
would
be
his
how
she
would
love
him
become
quite
and
how
all
he
had
thought
and
heard
of
her
might
be
and
he
again
saw
her
not
as
the
daughter
of
prince
but
visualized
her
whole
body
only
veiled
by
its
gray
why
did
this
thought
never
occur
to
me
and
again
he
told
himself
that
it
was
that
there
would
be
something
and
as
it
seemed
to
him
in
this
he
recalled
her
former
words
and
looks
and
the
words
and
looks
of
those
who
had
seen
them
he
recalled
anna
words
and
looks
when
she
spoke
to
him
about
his
recalled
thousands
of
such
hints
from
prince
vasili
and
and
was
seized
by
terror
lest
he
had
in
some
bound
himself
to
do
something
that
was
evidently
wrong
and
that
he
ought
not
to
but
at
the
very
time
he
was
expressing
this
conviction
to
in
another
part
of
his
mind
her
image
rose
in
all
its
womanly
chapter
ii
in
prince
vasili
had
to
go
on
a
tour
of
inspection
in
four
different
he
had
arranged
this
for
himself
so
as
to
visit
his
neglected
estates
at
the
same
time
and
pick
up
his
son
anatole
where
his
regiment
was
and
take
him
to
visit
prince
nicholas
bolkonski
in
order
to
arrange
a
match
for
him
with
the
daughter
of
that
rich
old
but
before
leaving
home
and
undertaking
these
new
prince
vasili
had
to
settle
matters
with
it
is
had
latterly
spent
whole
days
at
that
in
prince
house
where
he
was
and
had
been
and
foolish
in
presence
a
lover
should
but
had
not
yet
proposed
to
is
all
very
but
things
must
be
said
prince
vasili
to
with
a
sorrowful
one
feeling
that
pierre
who
was
under
such
obligations
to
him
never
mind
was
not
behaving
very
well
in
this
god
be
with
thought
relishing
his
own
goodness
of
it
must
be
brought
to
a
the
day
after
tomorrow
will
be
name
i
will
invite
two
or
three
and
if
he
does
not
understand
what
he
ought
to
do
then
it
will
be
my
my
i
am
her
six
weeks
after
anna
and
after
the
sleepless
night
when
he
had
decided
that
to
marry
helene
would
be
a
calamity
and
that
he
ought
to
avoid
her
and
go
despite
that
had
not
left
prince
and
felt
with
terror
that
in
eyes
he
was
every
day
more
and
more
connected
with
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
return
to
his
former
conception
of
that
he
could
not
break
away
from
and
that
though
it
would
be
a
terrible
thing
he
would
have
to
unite
his
fate
with
he
might
perhaps
have
been
able
to
free
himself
but
that
prince
vasili
had
rarely
before
given
now
hardly
let
a
day
go
by
without
having
an
evening
party
at
which
pierre
had
to
be
present
unless
he
wished
to
spoil
the
general
pleasure
and
disappoint
prince
in
the
rare
moments
when
he
was
at
would
take
hand
in
passing
and
draw
it
or
hold
out
his
shaven
cheek
for
pierre
to
kiss
and
would
in
to
dinner
or
i
shall
not
see
am
staying
in
for
your
and
so
and
though
prince
when
he
stayed
in
he
for
hardly
exchanged
a
couple
of
words
with
pierre
felt
unable
to
disappoint
every
day
he
said
to
himself
one
and
the
same
is
time
i
understood
her
and
made
up
my
mind
what
she
really
was
i
mistaken
or
am
i
mistaken
she
is
not
she
is
an
excellent
he
sometimes
said
to
himself
never
makes
a
never
says
anything
she
says
but
what
she
does
say
is
always
clear
and
so
she
is
not
she
never
was
abashed
and
is
not
abashed
so
she
cannot
be
a
bad
he
had
often
begun
to
make
reflections
or
think
aloud
in
her
and
she
had
always
answered
him
either
by
a
brief
but
appropriate
that
it
did
not
interest
by
a
silent
look
and
smile
which
more
palpably
than
anything
else
showed
pierre
her
she
was
right
in
regarding
all
arguments
as
nonsense
in
comparison
with
that
she
always
addressed
him
with
a
radiantly
confiding
smile
meant
for
him
in
which
there
was
something
more
significant
than
in
the
general
smile
that
usually
brightened
her
pierre
knew
that
everyone
was
waiting
for
him
to
say
a
word
and
cross
a
certain
and
he
knew
that
sooner
or
later
he
would
step
across
but
an
incomprehensible
terror
seized
him
at
the
thought
of
that
dreadful
a
thousand
times
during
that
month
and
a
half
while
he
felt
himself
drawn
nearer
and
nearer
to
that
dreadful
pierre
said
to
am
i
i
need
can
it
be
that
i
have
he
wished
to
take
a
but
felt
with
dismay
that
in
this
matter
he
lacked
that
strength
of
will
which
he
had
known
in
himself
and
really
pierre
was
one
of
those
who
are
only
strong
when
they
feel
themselves
quite
and
since
that
day
when
he
was
overpowered
by
a
feeling
of
desire
while
stooping
over
the
snuffbox
at
anna
an
unacknowledged
sense
of
the
guilt
of
that
desire
paralyzed
his
on
name
a
small
party
of
just
their
own
his
wife
for
supper
at
prince
all
these
friends
and
relations
had
been
given
to
understand
that
the
fate
of
the
young
girl
would
be
decided
that
the
visitors
were
seated
at
princess
a
portly
imposing
woman
who
had
once
been
was
sitting
at
the
head
of
the
on
either
side
of
her
sat
the
more
important
old
general
and
his
and
anna
pavlovna
at
the
other
end
sat
the
younger
and
less
important
and
there
too
sat
the
members
of
the
and
pierre
and
side
by
prince
vasili
was
not
having
any
he
went
round
the
table
in
a
merry
sitting
down
now
by
now
by
of
the
to
each
of
them
he
made
some
careless
and
agreeable
remark
except
to
pierre
and
whose
presence
he
seemed
not
to
he
enlivened
the
whole
the
wax
candles
burned
the
silver
and
crystal
so
did
the
toilets
and
the
gold
and
silver
of
the
servants
in
scarlet
liveries
moved
round
the
the
clatter
of
and
glasses
mingled
with
the
animated
hum
of
several
at
one
end
of
the
the
old
chamberlain
was
heard
assuring
an
old
baroness
that
he
loved
her
at
which
she
at
the
other
could
be
heard
the
story
of
the
misfortunes
of
some
mary
viktorovna
or
at
the
center
of
the
prince
vasili
attracted
with
a
facetious
smile
on
his
he
was
telling
the
ladies
about
last
meeting
of
the
imperial
at
which
sergey
kuzmich
the
new
military
governor
general
of
had
received
and
read
the
then
famous
rescript
of
the
emperor
alexander
from
the
army
to
sergey
in
which
the
emperor
said
that
he
was
receiving
from
all
sides
declarations
of
the
that
the
declaration
from
petersburg
gave
him
particular
and
that
he
was
proud
to
be
at
the
head
of
such
a
nation
and
would
endeavor
to
be
worthy
of
this
rescript
began
with
the
from
all
sides
reports
reach
and
so
he
never
got
farther
asked
one
of
the
not
a
breadth
answered
prince
from
all
from
all
sergey
poor
vyazmitinov
could
not
get
any
he
began
the
rescript
again
and
but
as
soon
as
he
uttered
he
and
all
was
smothered
in
sobs
and
he
could
get
no
and
again
his
and
from
all
and
till
at
last
somebody
else
was
asked
to
read
from
all
and
then
someone
repeated
be
cried
anna
pavlovna
from
her
end
of
the
table
holding
up
a
threatening
is
such
a
worthy
and
excellent
our
dear
everybody
laughed
a
great
at
the
head
of
the
where
the
honored
guests
everyone
seemed
to
be
in
high
spirits
and
under
the
influence
of
a
variety
of
exciting
only
pierre
and
helene
sat
silently
side
by
side
almost
at
the
bottom
of
the
a
suppressed
smile
brightening
both
their
a
smile
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
sergey
smile
of
bashfulness
at
their
own
but
much
as
all
the
rest
and
much
as
they
enjoyed
their
rhine
and
and
however
they
avoided
looking
at
the
young
and
heedless
and
unobservant
as
they
seemed
of
one
could
feel
by
the
occasional
glances
they
gave
that
the
story
about
sergey
the
and
the
food
were
all
a
and
that
the
whole
attention
of
that
company
was
directed
pierre
and
prince
vasili
mimicked
the
sobbing
of
sergey
kuzmich
and
at
the
same
time
his
eyes
glanced
toward
his
and
while
he
laughed
the
expression
on
his
face
clearly
getting
it
will
all
be
settled
anna
pavlovna
threatened
him
on
behalf
of
dear
and
in
her
for
an
glanced
at
prince
vasili
read
a
congratulation
on
his
future
and
on
his
the
old
princess
sighed
sadly
as
she
offered
some
wine
to
the
old
lady
next
to
her
and
glanced
angrily
at
her
and
her
sigh
seemed
to
nothing
left
for
you
and
me
but
to
sip
sweet
my
now
that
the
time
has
come
for
these
young
ones
to
be
thus
provocatively
what
nonsense
all
this
is
that
i
am
thought
a
glancing
at
the
happy
faces
of
the
into
the
and
artificial
interests
uniting
that
society
had
entered
the
simple
feeling
of
the
attraction
of
a
healthy
and
handsome
young
man
and
woman
for
one
and
this
human
feeling
dominated
everything
else
and
soared
above
all
their
affected
jests
fell
news
was
not
and
the
animation
was
evidently
not
only
the
guests
but
even
the
footmen
waiting
at
table
seemed
to
feel
and
they
forgot
their
duties
as
they
looked
at
the
beautiful
helene
with
her
radiant
face
and
at
the
and
happy
though
uneasy
face
of
it
seemed
as
if
the
very
light
of
the
candles
was
focused
on
those
two
happy
faces
pierre
felt
that
he
was
the
center
of
it
and
this
both
pleased
and
embarrassed
he
was
like
a
man
entirely
absorbed
in
some
he
did
not
or
understand
anything
only
now
and
then
detached
ideas
and
impressions
from
the
world
of
reality
shot
unexpectedly
through
his
it
is
all
he
how
has
it
all
how
now
i
know
that
not
because
of
her
nor
of
myself
but
because
of
it
must
inevitably
come
they
are
all
expecting
they
are
so
sure
that
it
will
happen
that
i
i
disappoint
but
how
will
it
i
do
not
but
it
will
certainly
thought
glancing
at
those
dazzling
shoulders
close
to
his
or
he
would
suddenly
feel
ashamed
of
he
knew
not
he
felt
it
awkward
to
attract
attention
and
to
be
considered
a
lucky
man
with
his
plain
to
be
looked
on
as
a
sort
of
paris
possessed
of
a
no
doubt
it
always
is
and
must
be
he
consoled
what
have
i
done
to
bring
it
how
did
it
i
traveled
from
moscow
with
prince
then
there
was
so
why
should
i
not
stay
at
his
then
i
played
cards
with
her
and
picked
up
her
reticule
and
drove
out
with
how
did
it
when
did
it
all
come
and
here
he
was
sitting
by
her
side
as
her
feeling
her
her
her
her
then
it
would
suddenly
seem
to
him
that
it
was
not
she
but
he
was
so
unusually
and
that
that
was
why
they
all
looked
so
at
and
flattered
by
this
general
admiration
he
would
expand
his
raise
his
and
rejoice
at
his
good
suddenly
he
heard
a
familiar
voice
repeating
something
to
him
a
second
but
pierre
was
so
absorbed
that
he
did
not
understand
what
was
am
asking
you
when
you
last
heard
from
repeated
prince
vasili
a
third
you
my
dear
prince
vasili
and
pierre
noticed
that
everyone
was
smiling
at
him
and
what
of
if
you
all
know
thought
of
the
and
he
himself
smiled
his
gentle
childlike
and
helene
smiled
did
you
get
the
was
it
from
repeated
prince
who
pretended
to
want
to
know
this
in
order
to
settle
a
can
one
talk
or
think
of
such
thought
from
he
with
a
after
supper
pierre
with
his
partner
followed
the
others
into
the
drawing
the
guests
began
to
some
without
taking
leave
of
as
if
unwilling
to
distract
her
from
an
important
came
up
to
her
for
a
moment
and
made
haste
to
go
refusing
to
let
her
see
them
the
diplomatist
preserved
a
mournful
silence
as
he
left
the
drawing
he
pictured
the
vanity
of
his
diplomatic
career
in
comparison
with
the
old
general
grumbled
at
his
wife
when
she
asked
how
his
leg
the
old
he
princess
helene
will
be
beautiful
still
when
think
i
may
congratulate
whispered
anna
pavlovna
to
the
old
kissing
her
i
this
headache
have
stayed
the
old
princess
did
not
she
was
tormented
by
jealousy
of
her
while
the
guests
were
taking
their
leave
pierre
remained
for
a
long
time
alone
with
helene
in
the
little
drawing
room
where
they
were
he
had
often
during
the
last
six
remained
alone
with
but
had
never
spoken
to
her
of
now
he
felt
that
it
was
but
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
take
the
final
he
felt
he
felt
that
he
was
occupying
someone
place
here
beside
happiness
is
not
for
some
inner
voice
whispered
to
happiness
is
for
those
who
have
not
in
them
what
there
is
in
as
he
had
to
say
he
began
by
asking
her
whether
she
was
satisfied
with
the
she
replied
in
her
usual
simple
manner
that
this
name
day
of
hers
had
been
one
of
the
pleasantest
she
had
ever
some
of
the
nearest
relatives
had
not
yet
they
were
sitting
in
the
large
drawing
prince
vasili
came
up
to
pierre
with
languid
pierre
rose
and
said
it
was
getting
prince
vasili
gave
him
a
look
of
stern
as
though
what
pierre
had
just
said
was
so
strange
that
one
could
not
take
it
but
then
the
expression
of
severity
and
he
drew
hand
made
him
sit
and
smiled
he
turning
instantly
to
his
daughter
and
addressing
her
with
the
careless
tone
of
habitual
tenderness
natural
to
parents
who
have
petted
their
children
from
but
which
prince
vasili
had
only
acquired
by
imitating
other
and
he
again
turned
to
all
he
unbuttoning
the
top
button
of
his
pierre
but
his
smile
showed
that
he
knew
it
was
not
the
story
about
sergey
kuzmich
that
interested
prince
vasili
just
and
prince
vasili
saw
that
pierre
knew
he
suddenly
muttered
something
and
went
it
seemed
to
pierre
that
even
the
prince
was
the
sight
of
the
discomposure
of
that
old
man
of
the
world
touched
he
looked
at
helene
and
she
too
seemed
and
her
look
seemed
to
it
is
your
own
step
must
be
taken
but
i
i
thought
and
he
again
began
speaking
about
indifferent
about
sergey
asking
what
the
point
of
the
story
was
as
he
had
not
heard
it
helene
answered
with
a
smile
that
she
too
had
missed
when
prince
vasili
returned
to
the
drawing
the
his
was
talking
in
low
tones
to
the
elderly
lady
about
it
is
a
very
brilliant
but
my
are
made
in
replied
the
elderly
prince
vasili
passed
seeming
not
to
hear
the
and
sat
down
on
a
sofa
in
a
far
corner
of
the
he
closed
his
eyes
and
seemed
to
be
his
head
sank
forward
and
then
he
roused
he
said
to
his
and
see
what
they
are
the
princess
went
up
to
the
passed
by
it
with
a
dignified
and
indifferent
and
glanced
into
the
little
drawing
pierre
and
helene
still
sat
talking
just
as
the
she
said
to
her
prince
vasili
twisting
his
his
cheeks
quivered
and
his
face
assumed
the
unpleasant
expression
peculiar
to
shaking
he
threw
back
his
and
with
resolute
steps
went
past
the
ladies
into
the
little
drawing
with
quick
steps
he
went
joyfully
up
to
his
face
was
so
unusually
triumphant
that
pierre
rose
in
alarm
on
seeing
said
prince
wife
has
told
me
put
one
arm
around
pierre
and
the
other
around
his
dear
i
am
very
voice
loved
your
and
she
will
make
you
a
good
god
bless
he
embraced
his
and
then
again
and
kissed
him
with
his
malodorous
tears
actually
moistened
his
come
he
the
old
princess
came
in
and
also
the
elderly
lady
was
using
her
handkerchief
pierre
was
and
he
kissed
the
beautiful
hand
several
after
a
while
they
were
left
alone
this
had
to
be
and
could
not
be
thought
it
is
useless
to
ask
whether
it
is
good
or
it
is
good
because
definite
and
one
is
rid
of
the
old
tormenting
pierre
held
the
hand
of
his
betrothed
in
looking
at
her
beautiful
bosom
as
it
rose
and
he
said
aloud
and
special
is
always
said
in
such
he
but
could
not
remember
what
it
was
that
people
he
looked
at
her
she
drew
nearer
to
her
face
take
those
she
pointing
to
his
pierre
took
them
and
his
besides
the
strange
look
eyes
have
from
which
spectacles
have
just
been
had
also
a
frightened
and
inquiring
he
was
about
to
stoop
over
her
hand
and
kiss
but
with
a
almost
brutal
movement
of
her
she
intercepted
his
lips
and
met
them
with
her
her
face
struck
by
its
unpleasantly
excited
is
too
late
besides
i
love
thought
vous
he
remembering
what
has
to
be
said
at
such
but
his
words
sounded
so
weak
that
he

ashamed
of
love

weeks
later

a
letter
from

with
downcast
what

to
know
that
on
such
occasions
she
ought
to
behave
like
mademoiselle

not

the

and
with
what
difficulty

not

its
sunken
and
faded
dressed
as
she
used
to
be
in

it
was
still
more
noticeable
how
much
plainer
she
had
some
unobtrusive
touch

been
added

and
merrily
began
to
devise
and
carry
out

plan
of
how
princess

should
be
princess
was
wounded
by
the
fact
that
the
arrival
of
a
suitor
agitated
and
still
more
so
by
both
her
not
having
the
least
conception
that
it
could
be
to
tell
them
that
she
felt
ashamed
for
herself
and
for
them
would
be
to
betray
her
while
to
decline
their
offers
to
dress
her
would
prolong
their
banter
and
she
her
beautiful
eyes
grew
red
blotches
came
on
her
and
it
took
on
the
unattractive
martyrlike
expression
it
so
often
as
she
submitted
herself
to
mademoiselle
bourienne
and
both
these
women
quite
sincerely
tried
to
make
her
look
she
was
so
plain
that
neither
of
them
could
think
of
her
as
a
so
they
began
dressing
her
with
perfect
and
with
the
naive
and
firm
conviction
women
have
that
dress
can
make
a
face
my
this
dress
is
not
said
looking
sideways
at
princess
mary
from
a
little
have
a
maroon
have
it
you
know
the
fate
of
your
whole
life
may
be
at
but
this
one
is
too
not
it
was
not
the
but
the
face
and
whole
figure
of
princess
mary
that
was
not
but
neither
mademoiselle
bourienne
nor
the
little
princess
felt
they
still
thought
that
if
a
blue
ribbon
were
placed
in
the
the
hair
combed
and
the
blue
scarf
arranged
lower
on
the
best
maroon
and
so
all
would
be
they
forgot
that
the
frightened
face
and
the
figure
could
not
be
and
that
however
they
might
change
the
setting
and
adornment
of
that
it
would
still
remain
piteous
and
after
two
or
three
changes
to
which
princess
mary
meekly
just
as
her
hair
had
been
arranged
on
the
top
of
her
head
style
that
quite
altered
and
spoiled
her
and
she
had
put
on
a
maroon
dress
with
a
the
little
princess
walked
twice
round
now
adjusting
a
fold
of
the
dress
with
her
little
now
arranging
the
scarf
and
looking
at
her
with
her
head
bent
first
on
one
side
and
then
on
the
it
will
not
she
said
clasping
her
really
this
dress
does
not
suit
i
prefer
you
in
your
little
gray
everyday
now
do
it
for
my
she
said
to
the
the
princess
her
gray
and
mademoiselle
how
i
shall
arrange
she
smiling
with
a
foretaste
of
artistic
but
when
katie
brought
the
required
princess
mary
remained
sitting
motionless
before
the
looking
at
her
and
saw
in
the
mirror
her
eyes
full
of
tears
and
her
mouth
ready
to
burst
into
dear
said
mademoiselle
one
more
little
the
little
taking
the
dress
from
the
came
up
to
princess
now
arrange
something
quite
simple
and
she
the
three
mademoiselle
and
who
was
laughing
at
mingled
in
a
merry
like
the
chirping
of
leave
me
said
princess
her
voice
sounded
so
serious
and
so
sad
that
the
chirping
of
the
birds
was
silenced
at
they
looked
at
the
thoughtful
eyes
full
of
tears
and
of
gazing
shiningly
and
imploringly
at
and
understood
that
it
was
useless
and
even
cruel
to
change
your
said
the
little
i
tell
she
went
turning
reproachfully
to
mademoiselle

a
face
which
such
a
coiffure
does
not
suit
in
the
not
in
the
please
change
me
please
leave
me
it
is
all
quite
the
same
to
answered
a
voice
struggling
with
mademoiselle
bourienne
and
the
little
princess
had
to
own
to
themselves
that
princess
mary
in
this
guise
looked
very
worse
than
but
it
was
too
she
was
looking
at
them
with
an
expression
they
both
an
expression
thoughtful
and
this
expression
in
princess
mary
did
not
frighten
them
never
inspired
fear
in
but
they
knew
that
when
it
appeared
on
her
she
became
mute
and
was
not
to
be
shaken
in
her
will
change

and
as
princess
mary

left
the
princess

did
not

left
her
hair
as
it
but
did
not
even
look
in
her
letting
her
arms
fall
she
sat
with
downcast
eyes
and
a
a
a
strong
dominant
and
strangely
attractive
being
rose
in
her
and
carried
her
into
a
totally
different
happy
world

before

the
voice
at

she
roused
and
felt
appalled
at
what
she
had
been
and
before
going
down
she
went
into
the
room

the

smelling
of
when
she
looked
up
at
him
she
was
struck
by
his
anatole
stood
with
his
right
thumb
under
a
button
of
his
his
chest
expanded
and
his
back
drawn
slightly
swinging
one
with
his
head
a
little
looked
with
beaming
face
at
the
princess
without
speaking
and
evidently
not
thinking
about
her
at
anatole
was
not
nor
ready
or
eloquent
in
but
he
had
the
so
invaluable
in
of
composure
and
imperturbable
if
a
man
lacking
in
remains
dumb
on
a
first
introduction
and
betrays
a
consciousness
of
the
impropriety
of
such
silence
and
an
anxiety
to
find
something
to
the
effect
is
but
anatole
was
swung
his
and
smilingly
examined
the
it
was
evident
that
he
could
be
silent
in
this
way
for
a
very
long
anyone
finds
this
silence
let
him
but
i
want
he
seemed
to
besides
in
his
behavior
to
women
anatole
had
a
manner
which
particularly
inspires
in
them
and
even
supercilious
consciousness
of
his
own
it
was
as
if
he
said
to
know
i
know
but
why
should
i
bother
about
be
only
too
of
perhaps
he
did
not
really
think
this
when
he
met
probably
he
did
for
in
general
he
thought
very
his
looks
and
manner
gave
that
the
princess
felt
and
as
if
wishing
to
show
him
that
she
did
not
even
dare
expect
to
interest
she
turned
to
his
the
conversation
was
general
and
thanks
to
princess
voice
and
little
downy
lip
that
lifted
over
her
white
she
met
prince
vasili
with
that
playful
manner
often
employed
by
lively
chatty
and
consisting
in
the
assumption
that
between
the
person
they
so
address
and
themselves
there
are
some
jokes
and
amusing
though
no
such
reminiscences
really
as
none
existed
in
this
prince
vasili
readily
adopted
her
tone
and
the
little
princess
also
drew
whom
she
hardly
into
these
amusing
recollections
of
things
that
had
never
mademoiselle
bourienne
also
shared
them
and
even
princess
mary
felt
herself
pleasantly
made
to
share
in
these
merry
at
least
we
shall
have
the
benefit
of
your
company
all
to
dear
said
the
little
princess
in
to
prince
not
as
at
receptions
where
you
always
ran
you
remember
cette
chere
anna
but
you
talk
politics
to
me
like
our
little
tea
is
it
you
were
never
at
the
little
princess
asked
i
i
she
said
with
a
sly
brother
hippolyte
told
me
about
your
goings
and
she
shook
her
finger
at
have
even
heard
of
your
doings
in
hippolyte
tell
asked
prince
turning
to
his
son
and
seizing
the
little
arm
as
if
she
would
have
run
away
and
he
had
just
managed
to
catch
he
tell
you
how
he
himself
was
pining
for
the
dear
and
how
she
showed
him
the
she
is
a
pearl
among
he
turning
to
princess
when
paris
was
mademoiselle
bourienne
for
her
part
seized
the
opportunity
of
joining
in
the
general
current
of
she
took
the
liberty
of
inquiring
whether
it
was
long
since
anatole
had
left
paris
and
how
he
had
liked
that
anatole
answered
the
frenchwoman
very
readily
looking
at
her
with
a
talked
to
her
about
her
native
when
he
saw
the
pretty
little
anatole
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
would
not
find
bald
hills
dull
at
all
he
examining
at
all
that
little
i
hope
she
will
bring
her
along
with
her
when
la
petite
est
the
little
one
is
the
old
prince
dressed
leisurely
in
his
frowning
and
considering
what
he
was
to
the
coming
of
these
visitors
annoyed
are
prince
vasili
and
that
son
of
his
to
prince
vasili
is
a
shallow
braggart
and
his
no
is
a
fine
he
grumbled
to
what
angered
him
was
that
the
coming
of
these
visitors
revived
in
his
mind
an
unsettled
question
he
always
tried
to
one
about
which
he
always
deceived
the
question
was
whether
he
could
ever
bring
himself
to
part
from
his
daughter
and
give
her
to
a
the
prince
never
directly
asked
himself
that
knowing
beforehand
that
he
would
have
to
answer
it
and
justice
clashed
not
only
with
his
feelings
but
with
the
very
possibility
of
life
without
princess
little
as
he
seemed
to
value
was
unthinkable
to
why
should
she
he
be
unhappy
for
married
to
better
husband
one
would
think
could
hardly
be
found
is
she
contented
with
her
and
who
would
marry
marie
for
plain
and
take
her
for
her
connections
and
are
there
no
women
living
and
even
the
happier
for
so
thought
prince
bolkonski
while
and
yet
the
question
he
was
always
putting
off
demanded
an
immediate
prince
vasili
had
brought
his
son
with
the
evident
intention
of
and
today
or
tomorrow
he
would
probably
ask
for
an
his
birth
and
position
in
society
were
not
nothing
against
the
prince
said
to
he
must
be
worthy
of
and
that
is
what
we
shall
is
what
we
shall
that
is
what
we
shall
he
added
he
entered
the
drawing
room
with
his
usual
alert
glancing
rapidly
round
the
he
noticed
the
change
in
the
little
mademoiselle
princess
unbecoming
mademoiselle
and
and
the
loneliness
of
his
daughter
amid
the
general
herself
up
like
a
he
looking
irritably
at
is
and
he
ignores
he
went
straight
up
to
prince

how
glad
to
see

he
offered

looked
at
him
with
curiosity
and
perfect
waiting
for
a
display
of
the
eccentricities
his
father
had
told
him
to
prince
bolkonski
sat
down
in
his
usual
place
in
the
corner
of
the
sofa
drawing
up
an
armchair
for
prince
pointed
to
it
and
began
questioning
him
about
political
affairs
and
he
seemed
to
listen
attentively
to
what
prince
vasili
but
kept
glancing
at
princess
so
they
are
writing
from
potsdam
he
repeating

then
he
suddenly
went
up
to
his

he
sat
down
paying
no
more
attention
to
his
who
was
reduced
to
the
that
coiffure
suits
the
princess
very
said

suddenly

took

and

soon
as

announced

hopes
and
wishes

and
the
old
prince
her
all
the
same
to
he
screamed
in
the
same
piercing
tone
as
when
parting
from
his
will
tell
you
said
prince
vasili
in
the
tone
of
a
crafty
man
convinced
of
the
futility
of
being
cunning
with
so
a
you
see
right
through
anatole
is
no
but
he
is
an
goodhearted
an
excellent
son
or
all
as
always
happens
when
women
lead
lonely
lives
for
any
length
of
time
without
male
on
appearance
all
the
three
women
of
prince
household
felt
that
their
life
had
not
been
real
till
their
powers
of
and
observing
immediately
increased
and
their
which
seemed
to
have
been
passed
in
was
suddenly
lit
up
by
a
new
full
of
princess
mary
grew
quite
unconscious
of
her
face
and
the
handsome
open
face
of
the
man
who
might
perhaps
be
her
husband
absorbed
all
her
he
seemed
to
her
and
she
felt
convinced
of
thousands
of
dreams
of
a
future
family
life
continually
rose
in
her
she
drove
them
away
and
tried
to
conceal
am
i
not
too
cold
with
thought
the
try
to
be
reserved
because
in
the
depth
of
my
soul
i
feel
too
near
to
him
but
then
he
cannot
know
what
i
think
of
him
and
may
imagine
that
i
do
not
like
and
princess
mary
but
could
not
to
be
cordial
to
her
new
devilish
thought
mademoiselle
also
roused
to
great
excitement
by
thought
in
another
of
a
handsome
young
woman
without
any
definite
without
relations
or
even
a
did
not
intend
to
devote
her
life
to
serving
prince
to
reading
aloud
to
him
and
being
friends
with
princess
mademoiselle
bourienne
had
long
been
waiting
for
a
russian
prince
able
to
appreciate
at
a
glance
her
superiority
to
the
badly
ungainly
russian
would
fall
in
love
with
her
and
carry
her
and
here
at
last
was
a
russian
mademoiselle
bourienne
knew
a
heard
from
her
aunt
but
finished
in
her
own
which
she
liked
to
repeat
to
it
was
the
story
of
a
girl
who
had
been
and
to
whom
her
poor
mother
pauvre
and
reproached
her
for
yielding
to
a
man
without
being
mademoiselle
bourienne
was
often
touched
to
tears
as
in
imagination
she
told
this
story
to
her
and
now
a
real
russian
had
he
would
carry
her
away
and
then
sa
pauvre
mere
would
appear
and
he
would
marry
so
her
future
shaped
itself
in
mademoiselle
head
at
the
very
time
she
was
talking
to
anatole
about
it
was
not
calculation
that
guided
her
did
not
even
for
a
moment
consider
what
she
should
but
all
this
had
long
been
familiar
to
and
now
that
anatole
had
appeared
it
just
grouped
itself
around
him
and
she
wished
and
tried
to
please
him
as
much
as
the
little
like
an
old
war
horse
that
hears
the
unconsciously
and
quite
forgetting
her
prepared
for
the
familiar
gallop
of
without
any
ulterior
motive
or
any
but
with
naive
and
lighthearted
although
in
female
society
anatole
usually
assumed
the
role
of
a
man
tired
of
being
run
after
by
his
vanity
was
flattered
by
the
spectacle
of
his
power
over
these
three
besides
he
was
beginning
to
feel
for
the
pretty
and
provocative
mademoiselle
bourienne
that
passionate
animal
feeling
which
was
apt
to
master
him
with
great
suddenness
and
prompt
him
to
the
coarsest
and
most
reckless
after
the
company
went
into
the
sitting
room
and
princess
mary
was
asked
to
play
on
the
laughing
and
in
high
came
and
leaned
on
his
facing
her
and
beside
mademoiselle
princess
mary
felt
his
look
with
a
painfully
joyous
her
favorite
sonata
bore
her
into
a
most
intimately
poetic
world
and
the
look
she
felt
upon
her
made
that
world
still
more
but
though
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
referred
not
to
her
but
to
the
movements
of
mademoiselle
little
which
he
was
then
touching
with
his
own
under
the
mademoiselle
bourienne
was
also
looking
at
princess
and
in
her
lovely
eyes
there
was
a
look
of
fearful
joy
and
hope
that
was
also
new
to
the
she
loves
thought
princess
happy
i
am
and
how
happy
i
may
be
with
such
a
friend
and
such
a
can
it
be
she
not
daring
to
look
at
his
but
still
feeling
his
eyes
gazing
at
in
the
after
when
all
were
about
to
anatole
kissed
princess
she
did
not
know
how
she
found
the
but
she
looked
straight
into
his
handsome
face
as
it
came
near
to
her
shortsighted
turning
from
princess
mary
he
went
up
and
kissed
mademoiselle
was
not
but
then
he
did
everything
so
simply
and
with
such
mademoiselle
bourienne
and
gave
the
princess
a
frightened
thought
the
it
possible
that
i
could
be
jealous
of
and
not
value
her
pure
affection
and
devotion
to
she
went
up
to
her
and
kissed
her
anatole
went
up
to
kiss
the
little
when
your
father
writes
to
tell
me
that
you
are
behaving
well
i
will
give
you
my
hand
to
not
till
she
and
smilingly
raising
a
finger
at
she
left
the
chapter
v
they
all
except
anatole
who
fell
asleep
as
soon
as
he
got
into
all
kept
awake
a
long
time
that
he
really
to
be
my
this
stranger
who
is
so
that
is
the
chief
thought
princess
and
which
she
had
seldom
came
upon
she
feared
to
look
it
seemed
to
her
that
someone
was
there
standing
behind
the
screen
in
the
dark
and
this
someone
was
he
was
also
this
man
with
the
white
black
and
red
she
rang
for
her
maid
and
asked
her
to
sleep
in
her
mademoiselle
bourienne
walked
up
and
down
the
conservatory
for
a
long
time
that
vainly
expecting
now
smiling
at
now
working
herself
up
to
tears
with
the
imaginary
words
of
her
pauvre
mere
rebuking
her
for
her
the
little
princess
grumbled
to
her
maid
that
her
bed
was
badly
she
could
not
lie
either
on
her
face
or
on
her
every
position
was
awkward
and
and
her
burden
oppressed
her
now
more
than
ever
because
presence
had
vividly
recalled
to
her
the
time
when
she
was
not
like
that
and
when
everything
was
light
and
she
sat
in
an
armchair
in
her
dressing
jacket
and
nightcap
and
sleepy
and
beat
and
turned
the
heavy
feather
bed
for
the
third
muttering
to
told
you
it
was
all
lumps
and
the
little
princess
should
be
glad
enough
to
fall
so
not
my
and
her
voice
quivered
like
that
of
a
child
about
to
the
old
prince
did
not
sleep
half
heard
him
pacing
angrily
about
and
the
old
prince
felt
as
though
he
had
been
insulted
through
his
the
insult
was
the
more
pointed
because
it
concerned
not
himself
but
his
whom
he
loved
more
than
he
kept
telling
himself
that
he
would
consider
the
whole
matter
and
decide
what
was
right
and
how
he
should
but
instead
of
that
he
only
excited
himself
more
and
first
man
that
turns
forgets
her
father
and
everything
runs
upstairs
and
does
up
her
hair
and
wags
her
tail
and
is
unlike
glad
to
throw
her
father
and
she
knew
i
should
notice
and
i
see
that
that
idiot
had
eyes
only
for
shall
have
to
get
rid
of
and
how
is
it
she
has
not
pride
enough
to
see
if
she
has
no
pride
for
herself
she
might
at
least
have
some
for
my
she
must
be
shown
that
the
blockhead
thinks
nothing
of
her
and
looks
only
at
she
has
no
but
let
her
the
old
prince
knew
that
if
he
told
his
daughter
she
was
making
a
mistake
and
that
anatole
meant
to
flirt
with
mademoiselle
princess
would
be
wounded
and
his
point
to
be
parted
from
would
be
so
pacifying
himself
with
this
he
called
tikhon
and
began
to
devil
brought
them
thought
while
tikhon
was
putting
the
nightshirt
over
his
old
body
and
never
invited
they
came
to
disturb
my
there
is
not
much
of
it
take
he
while
his
head
was
still
covered
by
the
tikhon
knew
his
habit
of
sometimes
thinking
and
therefore
met
with
unaltered
looks
the
angrily
inquisitive
expression
of
the
face
that
emerged
from
the
to
asked
the
like
all
good
instinctively
knew
the
direction
of

guessed
that
the
question
referred
to
prince
vasili
and
his

gone
to
bed
and
put
out
their
your

said
the
prince
and
thrusting
his
feet
into
his
slippers
and
his
arms
into
the
sleeves
of
his
dressing
he
went
to
the
couch
on
which
he
though
no
words
had
passed
between
anatole
and
mademoiselle
they
quite
understood
one
another
as
to
the
first
part
of
their
up
to
the
appearance
of
the
pauvre
they
understood
that
they
had
much
to
say
to
one
another
in
private
and
so
they
had
been
seeking
an
opportunity
since
morning
to
meet
one
another
when
princess
mary
went
to
her
room
at
the
usual
mademoiselle
bourienne
and
anatole
met
in

went
to
the
door
of
the
study
with
special
it
seemed
to
her
that
not
only
did
everybody
know
that
her
fate
would
be
decided
that
but
that
they
also
knew
what
she
thought
about

read
this
in

and
in
that
of
prince
who
made
her
a
low
bow
when
she
met
him
in
the
corridor
carrying
hot
the
old
prince
was
very
affectionate
and
careful
in
his
treatment
of
his
daughter
that
princess
mary
well
knew
this
painstaking
expression
of
her
his
face
wore
that
expression
when
his
dry
hands
clenched
with
vexation
at
her
not
understanding
a
sum
in
when
rising
from
his
chair
he
would
walk
away
from
repeating
in
a
low
voice
the
same
words
several
times
he
came
to
the
point
at
treating
her

had
a
proposition
made
me
concerning

said
with
an
unnatural
expect

guessed
that

some
reason

matter
with
but
at
that
moment
the
thought
occurred
to
her
that
her
fate
would
be
decided
now
or
she
lowered
her
eyes
so
as
not
to
see
the
gaze
under

she
felt
that
she
could
not

and
happily
but
what

had
said
about

going
straight
on
through

suddenly
the
whispering
of

with
a
gay
as

inviting
her
to

softly
into

found

sobbing
and
laughing
at

from

about
twice
asked
when

she
knew
that
and
remarked
that
they
might
very
likely
be
getting
a

each
time
that
these
hints
began
to
make
the

pricked
up
her
ears
from
the
beginning
of
the
meal
and
was
certain
that
there
was
some
secret
between
her
father
and
anna
that
it
had
something
to
do
with
her
and
that
anna
mikhaylovna
was
preparing

how
sensitive
her
mother
was
to
anything
relating

not
venture
to
ask
any
questions
at

she
was
too
excited
to
eat
anything

wriggling
about
on
her
chair
regardless
of

rushed

after

that
it
was
all
over
and
that
now
an

perhaps
she
deceived

paced
the

in
silence
for

would
have

even
more
of

nasty

they

so
many
that

been
a
heap
of
your
what
a

you
not
a
but
they
are
who
cry
about

you
remember
natasha
suddenly
after
a
sonya
i
remember
but
do
you
remember
so
that
you
remember
him
remember
said
with
an
expressive
evidently
wishing
to
give
her
words
a
very
definite
remember
nikolenka
i
remember
him
she
i
remember
i
remember
him
a
you
remember
asked
sonya
in
not
that
i
know
what
he
is
but
not
as
i
remember
just
shut
my
eyes
and
but
shut
her
nothing
at
said
looking
ecstatically
and
earnestly
at
her
friend
as
if
she
did
not
consider
her
worthy
to
hear
what
she
meant
to
say
and
as
if
she
were
saying
it
to
someone
with
whom
joking
was
out
of
the
am
in
love
with
your
brother
once
for
all
whatever
may
happen
to
him
or
to
shall
never
cease
to
love
him
as
long
as
i
natasha
looked
at
sonya
with
wondering
and
inquisitive
and
said
she
felt
that
sonya
was
speaking
the
that
there
was
such
love
as
sonya
was
speaking
but
natasha
had
not
yet
felt
anything
like
she
believed
it
could
but
did
not
understand
you
write
to
she
sonya
became
the
question
of
how
to
write
to
and
whether
she
ought
to
tormented
now
that
he
was
already
an
officer
and
a
wounded
would
it
be
right
to
remind
him
of
herself
as
it
might
of
the
obligations
to
her
he
had
taken
on
i
think
if
he
i
will
write
she
you
feel
ashamed
to
write
to
sonya
i
should
be
ashamed
to
write
to
not
going
should
you
be
i
awkward
and
would
make
me
i
know
why
be
said
offended
by
previous
because
she
was
in
love
with
that
fat
one
in
was
how
petya
described
his
the
new
count
now
in
love
with
that
meant
italian
singing
why
a
said
more
stupid
than
said
the
with
the
air
of
an
old
the
countess
had
been
prepared
by
anna
hints
at
on
retiring
to
her
own
she
sat
in
an
her
eyes
fixed
on
a
miniature
portrait
of
her
son
on
the
lid
of
a
while
the
tears
kept
coming
into
her
anna
with
the
came
on
tiptoe
to
the
door
and
come
she
said
to
the
old
count
who
was
following
and
she
went
closing
the
door
behind
the
count
put
his
ear
to
the
keyhole
and
at
first
he
heard
the
sound
of
indifferent
then
anna
voice
alone
in
a
long
then
a
then
then
both
voices
together
with
glad
and
then
anna
mikhaylovna
opened
the
her
face
wore
the
proud
expression
of
a
surgeon
who
has
just
performed
a
difficult
operation
and
admits
the
public
to
appreciate
his
is
she
said
to
the
pointing
triumphantly
to
the
who
sat
holding
in
one
hand
the
snuffbox
with
its
portrait
and
in
the
other
the
and
pressing
them
alternately
to
her
when
she
saw
the
she
stretched
out
her
arms
to
embraced
his
bald
over
which
she
again
looked
at
the
letter
and
the
and
in
order
to
press
them
again
to
her
she
slightly
pushed
away
the
bald
and
petya
now
entered
the
and
the
reading
of
the
letter
after
a
brief
description
of
the
campaign
and
the
two
battles
in
which
he
had
taken
and
his
nicholas
said
that
he
kissed
his
and
hands
asking
for
their
and
that
he
kissed
and
besides
he
sent
greetings
to
monsieur
madame
and
his
old
and
asked
them
to
kiss
for
him
whom
he
loved
and
thought
of
just
the
same
as
when
she
heard
this
sonya
blushed
so
that
tears
came
into
her
eyes
unable
to
bear
the
looks
turned
upon
ran
away
into
the
dancing
whirled
round
it
at
full
speed
with
her
dress
puffed
out
like
a
flushed
and
plumped
down
on
the
the
countess
was
are
you
asked
all
he
says
one
should
be
glad
and
not
this
was
quite
but
the
the
and
natasha
looked
at
her
who
is
it
she
takes
thought
the
letter
was
read
over
hundreds
of
and
those
who
were
considered
worthy
to
hear
it
had
to
come
to
the
for
she
did
not
let
it
out
of
her
the
tutors
and
the
and
and
several
and
the
countess
reread
the
letter
each
time
with
fresh
pleasure
and
each
time
discovered
in
it
fresh
proofs
of
how
how
how
joyful
it
that
her
the
scarcely
perceptible
motion
of
whose
tiny
limbs
she
had
felt
twenty
years
ago
within
that
son
about
whom
she
used
to
have
quarrels
with
the
too
indulgent
that
son
who
had
first
learned
to
say
and
then
that
this
son
should
now
be
away
in
a
foreign
land
amid
strange
a
manly
warrior
doing
some
kind
of
work
of
his
without
help
or
the
universal
experience
of
showing
that
children
do
grow
imperceptibly
from
the
cradle
to
did
not
exist
for
the
her
growth
toward
at
each
of
its
had
seemed
as
extraordinary
to
her
as
if
there
had
never
existed
the
millions
of
human
beings
who
grew
up
in
the
same
as
twenty
years
it
seemed
impossible
that
the
little
creature
who
lived
somewhere
under
her
heart
would
ever
suck
her
and
begin
to
so
now
she
could
not
believe
that
that
little
creature
could
be
this
brave
this
model
son
and
officer
judging
by
this
he
now
a
how
charmingly
he
said
reading
the
descriptive
part
of
the
what
a
not
a
word
about
not
a
about
some
denisov
or
though
he
i
dare
is
braver
than
any
of
he
says
nothing
about
his
what
a
how
like
him
it
and
how
he
has
remembered
not
forgetting
i
always
said
when
he
was
only
so
always
for
more
than
a
week
preparations
were
being
rough
drafts
of
letters
to
nicholas
from
all
the
household
were
written
and
copied
while
under
the
supervision
of
the
countess
and
the
solicitude
of
the
money
and
all
things
necessary
for
the
uniform
and
equipment
of
the
newly
commissioned
officer
were
anna
practical
woman
that
she
had
even
managed
by
favor
with
army
authorities
to
secure
advantageous
means
of
communication
for
herself
and
her
she
had
opportunities
of
sending
her
letters
to
the
grand
duke
constantine
who
commanded
the
the
rostovs
supposed
that
the
russian
was
quite
a
definite
and
that
if
a
letter
reached
the
grand
duke
in
command
of
the
guards
there
was
no
reason
why
it
should
not
reach
the
pavlograd
which
was
presumably
somewhere
in
the
same
and
so
it
was
decided
to
send
the
letters
and
money
by
the
grand
courier
to
boris
and
boris
was
to
forward
them
to
the
letters
were
from
the
old
the
and
and
finally
there
were
six
thousand
rubles
for
his
outfit
and
various
other
things
the
old
count
sent
to
his
chapter
vii
on
the
twelfth
of

preparing
to
be
reviewed
next

from

and
next
morning
were
to
come
straight
to
the

the
field
at
olmutz
by
ten
that
day
nicholas
rostov
received
a
letter
from
telling
him
that
the
ismaylov
regiment
was
quartered
for
the
night
ten
miles
from
olmutz
and
that
he
wanted
to
see
him
as
he
had
a
letter
and
money
for
rostov
was
particularly
in
need
of
money
now
that
the
after
their

stationed
near
olmutz
and
the
camp
swarmed
with
sutlers
and
austrian
jews
offering
all
sorts
of
tempting

pavlograds
held

after
celebrating
awards
they
had
received
for
the

made
expeditions
to
olmutz
to
visit
a
certain
caroline

had
recently
opened
a

rode
with

then
set
off

with
a

an

he
wore
a
crumpled
hussar
cap
stuck
jauntily
back
on
one
side
of
his
as
he
rode
up
to
the
camp
he
thought
how
he
would
impress
boris
and
all
his
comrades
of
the
guards
by
his
of
a
fighting
hussar
who
had
been

they
had
come

provided
excellent

for

at
every
halting

entered

left

by

brought
from

he

to

rudeness
of
his
he
be

before

looking
glass
and
brushed
the
hair
on
his
temples
in
the
way
affected
by
the
emperor
having
assured
himself
from
the
way
rostov
looked
at
it
that
his
coat
had
been
left
the
room
with
a
pleasant
what
a
beast
i
muttered
as
he
read

i
he
flushing
have
you
sent
gabriel
for
some
all
right

in
the
letter
from
his
parents
was
enclosed
a
letter
of
recommendation
to
bagration
which
the
old
countess
at
anna
advice
had
obtained
through
an
acquaintance
and
sent
to
her
asking
him
to
take
it
to
its
destination
and
make
use

throwing

some
letter
of
what
the
devil
do
i
want
it
the
said
picking
it
up
and
reading
the
letter
would
be
of
great
use
to
want
and
i
be
inquired
a
are
still
the
same
i
remarked
shaking
his
still
the
same
but
not
the
how
are
asked
as
you
so
far
all
but
i
confess
i
should
much
like
to
be
an
adjutant
and
not
remain
at
the
when
once
a
man
starts
on
military
he
should
try
to
make
as
successful
a
career
of
it
as
said
evidently
thinking
of
something
he
looked
intently
and
inquiringly
into
his
evidently
trying
in
vain
to
find
the
answer
to
some
old
gabriel
brought
in
the
we
now
send
for
asked
would
drink
with
i
send
for
and
how
do
you
get
on
with
that
asked
with
a
contemptuous
is
a
very
and
pleasant
answered
again
rostov
looked
intently
into
eyes
and
berg
and
over
the
bottle
of
wine
conversation
between
the
three
officers
became
the
guardsmen
told
rostov
of
their
march
and
how
they
had
been
made
much
of
in
and
they
spoke
of
the
sayings
and
doings
of
their
the
grand
and
told
stories
of
his
kindness
and
as
kept
silent
when
the
subject
did
not
relate
to
but
in
connection
with
the
stories
of
the
grand
quick
temper
he
related
with
gusto
how
in
galicia
he
had
managed
to
deal
with
the
grand
duke
when
the
latter
made
a
tour
of
the
regiments
and
was
annoyed
at
the
irregularity
of
a
with
a
pleasant
smile
berg
related
how
the
grand
duke
had
ridden
up
to
him
in
a
violent
was
the
favorite
expression
when
he
was
in
a
and
called
for
the
company
you
believe
i
was
not
at
all
because
i
knew
i
was
without
you
i
may
say
that
i
know
the
army
orders
by
heart
and
know
the
regulations
as
well
as
i
do
the
there
never
is
any
negligence
in
my
and
so
my
conscience
was
at
i
came
stood
up
and
showed
how
he
presented
with
his
hand
to
his
and
really
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
a
face
to
express
greater
respect
and
complacency
than
his
he
stormed
at
as
the
saying
stormed
and
stormed
and
it
was
not
a
matter
of
life
but
rather
of
as
the
saying
and
and
said
berg
with
a
sagacious
knew
i
was
in
the
right
so
i
kept
was
not
that
are
you
he
still
i
remained
and
what
do
you
the
next
day
it
was
not
even
mentioned
in
the
orders
of
the
what
keeping
head
the
said
lighting
his
pipe
and
emitting
rings
of
that
was
said
but
boris
noticed
that
he
was
preparing
to
make
fun
of
and
skillfully
changed
the
he
asked
him
to
tell
them
how
and
where
he
got
his
this
pleased
rostov
and
he
began
talking
about
and
as
he
went
on
became
more
and
more
he
told
them
of
his
schon
grabern
just
as
those
who
have
taken
part
in
a
battle
generally
do
describe
that
as
they
would
like
it
to
have
as
they
have
heard
it
described
by
and
as
sounds
but
not
at
all
as
it
really
rostov
was
a
truthful
young
man
and
would
on
no
account
have
told
a
deliberate
he
began
his
story
meaning
to
tell
everything
just
as
it
but
and
inevitably
he
lapsed
into
if
he
had
told
the
truth
to
his
like
himself
had
often
heard
stories
of
attacks
and
had
formed
a
definite
idea
of
what
an
attack
was
and
were
expecting
to
hear
just
such
a
would
either
not
have
believed
him
still
would
have
thought
that
rostov
was
himself
to
blame
since
what
generally
happens
to
the
narrators
of
cavalry
attacks
had
not
happened
to
he
could
not
tell
them
simply
that
everyone
went
at
a
trot
and
that
he
fell
off
his
horse
and
sprained
his
arm
and
then
ran
as
hard
as
he
could
from
a
frenchman
into
the
to
tell
everything
as
it
really
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
make
an
effort
of
will
to
tell
only
what
it
is
very
difficult
to
tell
the
and
young
people
are
rarely
capable
of
his
hearers
expected
a
story
of
how
beside
himself
and
all
aflame
with
he
had
flown
like
a
storm
at
the
cut
his
way
slashed
right
and
how
his
saber
had
tasted
flesh
and
he
had
fallen
and
so
and
so
he
told
them
all
in
the
middle
of
his
just
as
he
was
cannot
imagine
what
a
strange
frenzy
one
experiences
during
an
prince
whom
boris
was
entered
the
prince
who
liked
to
help
young
was
flattered
by
being
asked
for
his
assistance
and
being
well
disposed
toward
who
had
managed
to
please
him
the
day
he
wished
to
do
what
the
young
man
having
been
sent
with
papers
from
kutuzov
to
the
he
looked
in
on
hoping
to
find
him
when
he
came
in
and
saw
an
hussar
of
the
line
recounting
his
military
exploits
andrew
could
not
endure
that
sort
of
he
gave
boris
a
pleasant
frowned
as
with
eyes
he
looked
at
bowed
slightly
and
and
sat
down
languidly
on
the
he
felt
it
unpleasant
to
have
dropped
in
on
bad
rostov
flushed
up
on
noticing
but
he
did
not
this
was
a
mere
at
he
saw
that
he
too
seemed
ashamed
of
the
hussar
of
the
in
spite
of
prince
ironical
in
spite
of
the
contempt
with
which
from
his
fighting
army
point
of
regarded
all
these
little
adjutants
on
the
staff
of
whom
the
newcomer
was
evidently
rostov
felt
and
became
boris
inquired
what
news
there
might
be
on
the
and
without
one
might
ask
about
our
shall
probably
replied
evidently
reluctant
to
say
more
in
the
presence
of
a
berg
took
the
opportunity
to
with
great
as
was
the
allowance
of
forage
money
to
captains
of
companies
would
be
to
this
prince
andrew
answered
with
a
smile
that
he
could
give
no
opinion
on
such
an
important
government
and
berg
laughed
to
your
prince
andrew
addressing
will
talk
of
it
he
looked
round
at
to
me
after
the
review
and
we
will
do
what
is
having
glanced
round
the
prince
andrew
turned
to
whose
state
of
unconquerable
childish
embarrassment
now
changing
to
anger
he
did
not
condescend
to
and
think
you
were
talking
of
the
schon
grabern
were
you
was
said
rostov
as
if
intending
to
insult
the
bolkonski
noticed
the
state
of
and
it
amused
with
a
slightly
contemptuous
he
there
are
many
stories
now
told
about
that
repeated
rostov
looking
with
eyes
suddenly
grown
now
at
now
at
many
but
our
stories
are
the
stories
of
men
who
have
been
under
the
our
stories
have
some
not
like
the
stories
of
those
fellows
on
the
staff
who
get
rewards
without
doing
whom
you
imagine
me
to
be
said
prince
with
a
quiet
and
particularly
amiable
a
strange
feeling
of
exasperation
and
yet
of
respect
for
this
mingled
at
that
moment
in
am
not
talking
about
he
know
you
i
want
i
am
speaking
of
the
staff
in
i
will
tell
you
prince
andrew
interrupted
in
a
tone
of
quiet
wish
to
insult
and
i
am
ready
to
agree
with
you
that
it
would
be
very
easy
to
do
so
if
you
sufficient
but
admit
that
the
time
and
place
are
very
badly
in
a
day
or
two
we
shall
all
have
to
take
part
in
a
greater
and
more
serious
and
who
says
he
is
an
old
friend
of
is
not
at
all
to
blame
that
my
face
has
the
misfortune
to
displease
he
added
know
my
name
and
where
to
find
but
forget
that
i
do
not
regard
either
myself
or
you
as
having
been
at
all
and
as
a
man
older
than
my
advice
is
to
let
the
matter
well
on
friday
after
the
review
i
shall
expect
au
exclaimed
prince
and
with
a
bow
to
them
both
he
went
only
when
prince
andrew
was
gone
did
rostov
think
of
what
he
ought
to
have
and
he
was
still
more
angry
at
having
omitted
to
say
he
ordered
his
horse
at
once
coldly
taking
leave
of
rode
should
he
go
to
headquarters
next
day
and
challenge
that
affected
or
really
let
the
matter
was
the
question
that
worried
him
all
the
he
thought
angrily
of
the
pleasure
he
would
have
at
seeing
the
fright
of
that
small
and
frail
but
proud
man
when
covered
by
his
and
then
he
felt
with
surprise
that
of
all
the
men
he
knew
there
was
none
he
would
so
much
like
to
have
for
a
friend
as
that
very
adjutant
whom
he
so
chapter
viii
the
day
after
rostov
had
been
to
see
a
review
was
held
of
the
austrian
and
russian
both
those
freshly
arrived
from
russia
and
those
who
had
been
campaigning
under
the
two
the
russian
with
his
heir
the
and
the
austrian
with
the
inspected
the
allied
army
of
eighty
thousand
from
early
morning
the
smart
clean
troops
were
on
the
forming
up
on
the
field
before
the
now
thousands
of
feet
and
bayonets
moved
and
halted
at
the
turned
with
banners
formed
up
at
and
wheeled
round
other
similar
masses
of
infantry
in
different
now
was
heard
the
rhythmic
beat
of
hoofs
and
the
jingling
of
showy
cavalry
in
and
green
braided
with
smartly
dressed
bandsmen
in
front
mounted
on
or
gray
then
spreading
out
with
the
brazen
clatter
of
the
polished
shining
cannon
that
quivered
on
the
gun
carriages
and
with
the
smell
of
came
the
artillery
which
crawled
between
the
infantry
and
cavalry
and
took
up
its
appointed
not
only
the
generals
in
full
parade
with
their
thin
or
thick
waists
drawn
in
to
the
their
red
necks
squeezed
into
their
stiff
and
wearing
scarves
and
all
their
not
only
the
pomaded
but
every
soldier
with
his
freshly
washed
and
shaven
face
and
his
weapons
clean
and
polished
to
the
and
every
horse
groomed
till
its
coat
shone
like
satin
and
every
hair
of
its
wetted
mane
lay
that
no
small
matter
was
but
an
important
and
solemn
every
general
and
every
soldier
was
conscious
of
his
own
aware
of
being
but
a
drop
in
that
ocean
of
and
yet
at
the
same
time
was
conscious
of
his
strength
as
a
part
of
that
enormous
from
early
morning
strenuous
activities
and
efforts
had
begun
and
by
ten
all
had
been
brought
into
due
the
ranks
were
drawn
up
on
the
vast
the
whole
army
was
extended
in
three
the
cavalry
in
behind
it
the
and
behind
that
again
the
a
space
like
a
street
was
left
between
each
two
lines
of
the
three
parts
of
that
army
were
sharply
fighting
army
the
pavlograds
on
the
right
flank
of
the
those
recently
arrived
from
both
guards
and
regiments
of
the
and
the
austrian
but
they
all
stood
in
the
same
under
one
and
in
a
like
like
wind
over
leaves
ran
an
excited
alarmed
voices
were
and
a
stir
of
final
preparation
swept
over
all
the
from
the
direction
of
olmutz
in
front
of
a
group
was
seen
and
at
that
though
the
day
was
a
light
gust
of
wind
blowing
over
the
army
slightly
stirred
the
streamers
on
the
lances
and
the
unfolded
standards
fluttered
against
their
it
looked
as
if
by
that
slight
motion
the
army
itself
was
expressing
its
joy
at
the
approach
of
the
one
voice
was
heard
like
the
crowing
of
cocks
at
this
was
repeated
by
others
from
various
sides
and
all
became
in
the
deathlike
stillness
only
the
tramp
of
horses
was
this
was
the
the
emperors
rode
up
to
the
and
the
trumpets
of
the
first
cavalry
regiment
played
the
general
it
seemed
as
though
not
the
trumpeters
were
but
as
if
the
army
rejoicing
at
the
had
naturally
burst
into
amid
these
only
the
youthful
kindly
voice
of
the
emperor
alexander
was
clearly
he
gave
the
words
of
and
the
first
regiment
roared
so
and
joyfully
that
the
men
themselves
were
awed
by
their
multitude
and
the
immensity
of
the
power
they
standing
in
the
front
lines
of
army
which
the
tsar
approached
experienced
the
same
feeling
as
every
other
man
in
that
a
feeling
of
a
proud
consciousness
of
and
a
passionate
attraction
to
him
who
was
the
cause
of
this
he
felt
that
at
a
single
word
from
that
man
all
this
vast
mass
he
himself
an
insignificant
atom
in
would
go
through
fire
and
commit
or
perform
deeds
of
highest
and
so
he
could
not
but
tremble
and
his
heart
stand
still
at
the
imminence
of
that
thundered
from
all
one
regiment
after
another
greeting
the
tsar
with
the
strains
of
the
and
then
then
the
general
and
again
growing
ever
stronger
and
fuller
and
merging
into
a
deafening
till
the
tsar
reached
each
regiment
in
its
silence
and
immobility
seemed
like
a
lifeless
but
as
soon
as
he
came
up
it
became
its
thunder
joining
the
roar
of
the
whole
line
along
which
he
had
already
through
the
terrible
and
deafening
roar
of
those
amid
the
square
masses
of
troops
standing
motionless
as
if
turned
to
hundreds
of
riders
composing
the
suites
moved
carelessly
but
symmetrically
and
above
all
and
in
front
of
them
two
upon
them
the
tensely
passionate
attention
of
that
whole
mass
of
men
was
the
handsome
young
emperor
in
the
uniform
of
the
horse
wearing
a
cocked
hat
with
its
peaks
front
and
with
his
pleasant
face
and
resonant
though
not
loud
attracted
rostov
was
not
far
from
the
and
with
his
keen
sight
had
recognized
the
tsar
and
watched
his
when
he
was
within
twenty
and
nicholas
could
clearly
distinguish
every
detail
of
his
happy
young
he
experienced
a
feeling
of
tenderness
and
ecstasy
such
as
he
had
never
before
every
trait
and
every
movement
of
the
seemed
to
him
stopping
in
front
of
the
the
tsar
said
something
in
french
to
the
austrian
emperor
and
seeing
that
rostov
involuntarily
smiled
himself
and
felt
a
still
stronger
flow
of
love
for
his
he
longed
to
show
that
love
in
some
way
and
knowing
that
this
was
impossible
was
ready
to
the
tsar
called
the
colonel
of
the
regiment
and
said
a
few
words
to
what
would
happen
to
me
if
the
emperor
spoke
to
thought
should
die
of
the
tsar
addressed
the
officers
thank
you
i
thank
you
with
my
whole
to
rostov
every
word
sounded
like
a
voice
from
how
gladly
would
he
have
died
at
once
for
his
have
earned
the
standards
and
will
be
worthy
of
to
to
die
for
thought
the
tsar
said
something
more
which
rostov
did
not
and
the
straining
their
shouted
rostov
bending
over
his
shouted
with
all
his
feeling
that
he
would
like
to
injure
himself
by
that
if
only
to
express
his
rapture
the
tsar
stopped
a
few
minutes
in
front
of
the
hussars
as
if
can
the
emperor
be
thought
but
then
even
this
indecision
appeared
to
him
majestic
and
like
everything
else
the
tsar
that
hesitation
lasted
only
an
the
in
the
narrow
pointed
boot
then
touched
the
groin
of
the
bobtailed
bay
mare
he
his
hand
in
a
white
glove
gathered
up
the
and
he
moved
off
accompanied
by
an
irregularly
swaying
sea
of
farther
and
farther
he
rode
stopping
at
other
till
at
last
only
his
white
plumes
were
visible
to
rostov
from
amid
the
suites
that
surrounded
the
among
the
gentlemen
of
the
rostov
noticed
sitting
his
horse
indolently
and
rostov
recalled
their
quarrel
of
yesterday
and
the
question
presented
itself
whether
he
ought
or
ought
not
to
challenge
course
he
now
it
worth
thinking
or
speaking
of
it
at
such
a
at
a
time
of
such
such
and
such
what
do
any
of
our
quarrels
and
affronts
i
love
and
forgive
everybody
when
the
emperor
had
passed
nearly
all
the
the
troops
began
a
ceremonial
march
past
and
rostov
on
recently
purchased
from
rode
past
at
the
rear
of
his
alone
and
in
full
view
of
the
before
he
reached
who
was
a
splendid
spurred
bedouin
twice
and
successfully
put
him
to
the
showy
trot
in
which
the
animal
went
when
bending
his
foaming
muzzle
to
his
his
tail
as
if
also
conscious
of
the
eye
upon
passed
lifting
his
feet
with
a
high
and
graceful
as
if
flying
through
the
air
without
touching
the
rostov
his
legs
well
back
and
his
stomach
drawn
in
and
feeling
himself
one
with
his
rode
past
the
emperor
with
a
frowning
but
blissful
face
a
vewy
as
denisov
expressed
the
remarked
the
how
happy
i
should
be
if
he
ordered
me
to
leap
into
the
fire
this
thought
when
the
review
was
the
newly
arrived
and
also
collected
in
groups
and
began
to
talk
about
the
about
the
austrians
and
their
about
their
about
and
how
badly
the
latter
would
fare
especially
if
the
essen
corps
arrived
and
prussia
took
our
but
the
talk
in
every
group
was
chiefly
about
the
emperor
his
every
word
and
movement
was
described
with
they
all
had
but
one
to
advance
as
soon
as
possible
against
the
enemy
under
the
commanded
by
the
emperor
himself
they
could
not
fail
to
vanquish
be
it
whom
it
so
thought
rostov
and
most
of
the
officers
after
the
all
were
then
more
confident
of
victory
than
the
winning
of
two
battles
would
have
made
chapter
ix
the
day
after
the
in
his
best
uniform
and
with
his
comrade
best
wishes
for
rode
to
olmutz
to
see
wishing
to
profit
by
his
friendliness
and
obtain
for
himself
the
best
post
he
that
of
adjutant
to
some
important
a
position
in
the
army
which
seemed
to
him
most
is
all
very
well
for
whose
father
sends
him
ten
thousand
rubles
at
a
to
talk
about
not
wishing
to
cringe
to
anybody
and
not
be
but
i
who
have
nothing
but
my
brains
have
to
make
a
career
and
must
not
miss
but
must
avail
myself
of
he
he
did
not
find
prince
andrew
in
olmutz
that
but
the
appearance
of
the
town
where
the
headquarters
and
the
diplomatic
corps
were
stationed
and
the
two
emperors
were
living
with
their
and
courts
only
strengthened
his
desire
to
belong
to
that
higher
he
knew
no
and
despite
his
smart
all
these
exalted
personages
passing
in
the
streets
in
their
elegant
carriages
with
their
and
both
courtiers
and
military
seemed
so
immeasurably
above
an
insignificant
officer
of
the
that
they
not
only
did
not
wish
but
simply
could
be
aware
of
his
at
the
quarters
of
the
where
he
inquired
for
all
the
adjutants
and
even
the
orderlies
looked
at
him
as
if
they
wished
to
impress
on
him
that
a
great
many
officers
like
him
were
always
coming
there
and
that
everybody
was
heartily
sick
of
in
spite
of
or
rather
because
of
next
november
after
dinner
he
again
went
to
olmutz
entering
the
house
occupied
by
asked
for
prince
andrew
was
in
and
boris
was
shown
into
a
large
hall
probably
formerly
used
for
but
in
which
five
beds
now
and
furniture
of
various
a
and
a
one
nearest
the
was
sitting
at
the
table
in
a
persian
dressing
the
stout
lay
on
a
bed
with
his
arms
under
his
laughing
with
an
officer
who
had
sat
down
beside
a
third
was
playing
a
viennese
waltz
on
the
while
a
lying
on
the
sang
the
bolkonski
was
not
none
of
these
gentlemen
changed
his
position
on
seeing
the
one
who
was
writing
and
whom
boris
addressed
turned
round
crossly
and
told
him
bolkonski
was
on
duty
and
that
he
should
go
through
the
door
on
the
left
into
the
reception
room
if
he
wished
to
see
boris
thanked
him
and
went
to
the
reception
where
he
found
some
ten
officers
and
when
he
prince
his
eyes
drooping
contemptuously
that
peculiar
expression
of
polite
weariness
which
plainly
it
were
not
my
duty
i
would
not
talk
to
you
for
a
was
listening
to
an
old
russian
general
with
who
stood
very
almost
on
with
a
obsequious
expression
on
his
purple
reporting
be
so
good
as
to
said
prince
andrew
to
the
in
speaking
with
the
french
intonation
he
affected
when
he
wished
to
speak
and
noticing
prince
paying
no
more
heed
to
the
general
who
ran
after
him
imploring
him
to
hear
something
nodded
and
turned
to
him
with
a
cheerful
at
that
moment
boris
clearly
realized
what
he
had
before
that
in
the
besides
the
subordination
and
discipline
prescribed
in
the
military
which
he
and
the
others
knew
in
the
there
was
more
which
made
this
general
wait
respectfully
while
captain
prince
for
his
own
chose
to
chat
with
lieutenant
more
than
ever
was
boris
resolved
to
serve
in
future
not
according
to
the
written
but
under
this
unwritten
he
felt
now
that
merely
by
having
been
recommended
to
prince
andrew
he
had
already
risen
above
the
general
who
at
the
front
had
the
power
to
annihilate
a
lieutenant
of
the
prince
andrew
came
up
to
him
and
took
his
am
very
sorry
you
did
not
find
me
in
i
was
fussing
about
with
germans
all
we
went
with
weyrother
to
survey
the
when
germans
start
being
no
end
to
boris
as
if
he
understood
what
prince
andrew
was
alluding
to
as
something
generally
but
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
heard
or
even
the
term
my
dear
so
you
still
want
to
be
an
i
have
been
thinking
about
i
was
some
reason
boris
could
not
help
asking
the
he
has
had
a
letter
from
prince
kuragin
about
i
only
wanted
to
ask
because
i
fear
the
guards
be
in
he
added
as
if
in
all
talk
it
replied
prince
let
me
report
this
and
i
shall
be
at
your
while
prince
andrew
went
to
report
about
the
that
not
sharing
conception
of
the
advantages
of
the
unwritten
code
of
so
fixedly
at
the
presumptuous
lieutenant
who
had
prevented
his
finishing
what
he
had
to
say
to
the
adjutant
that
boris
felt
he
turned
away
and
waited
impatiently
for
prince
return
from
the
my
dear
i
have
been
thinking
about
said
prince
andrew
when
they
had
gone
into
the
large
room
where
the
clavichord
no
use
your
going
to
the
he
would
say
a
lot
of
pleasant
ask
you
to
would
not
be
bad
as
regards
the
unwritten
thought
nothing
more
would
come
of
there
will
soon
be
a
battalion
of
us
and
but
this
is
what
i
have
a
good
an
adjutant
general
and
an
excellent
prince
and
though
you
may
not
know
the
fact
is
that
now
kutuzov
with
his
staff
and
all
of
us
count
for
everything
is
now
centered
round
the
so
we
will
go
to
i
have
to
go
there
anyhow
and
i
have
already
spoken
to
him
about
we
shall
see
whether
he
cannot
attach
you
to
himself
or
find
a
place
for
you
somewhere
nearer
the
prince
andrew
always
became
specially
keen
when
he
had
to
guide
a
young
man
and
help
him
to
worldly
under
cover
of
obtaining
help
of
this
kind
for
which
from
pride
he
would
never
accept
for
he
kept
in
touch
with
the
circle
which
confers
success
and
which
attracted
he
very
readily
took
up
cause
and
went
with
him
to
it
was
late
in
the
evening
when
they
entered
the
palace
at
olmutz
occupied
by
the
emperors
and
their
that
same
day
a
council
of
war
had
been
held
in
which
all
the
members
of

hofkriegsrath
and
both
emperors
took
at
that
contrary
to

views
of

old
generals

and
prince

had
been
decided
to
advance
immediately
and
give
battle
to
the
council
of
war
was
just
over
when
prince
andrew
accompanied
by
boris
arrived
at
the
palace
to
find
everyone
at
headquarters
was
still
under
the
spell
of
the
at
which
the
party
of
the
young
had
the
voices
of
those
who
counseled
delay
and
advised
waiting
for
something
else
before
advancing
had
been
so
completely
silenced
and
their
arguments
confuted
by
such
conclusive
evidence
of
the
advantages
of
attacking
that
what
had
been
discussed
at
the
coming
battle
and
the
victory
that
would
certainly
result
from
longer

to
be
in
the
future
but
in
the
all
the
advantages
were
on
our
our
enormous
undoubtedly
superior
to
were
concentrated
in
one
the
troops
inspired
by
the
presence
were
eager
for
the
strategic
position
where
the
operations
would
take
place
was
familiar
in
all
its
details
to
the
austrian
general
a
lucky
accident
had
ordained
that
the
austrian
army
should
maneuver
the
previous
year
on
the
very
fields
where
the
french
had
now
to
be
the
adjacent
locality
was
known
and
shown
in
every
detail
on
the
and
evidently
was
undertaking
one
of
the
warmest
advocates
of
an
had
just
returned
from
the
tired
and
exhausted
but
eager
and
proud
of
the
victory
that
had
been
prince
andrew
introduced
his
but
prince
dolgorukov
politely
and
firmly
pressing
his
hand
said
nothing
to
boris
evidently
unable
to
suppress
the
thoughts
which
were
uppermost
in
his
mind
at
that
addressed
prince
andrew
in
my
dear
what
a
battle
we
have
god
grant
that
the
one
that
will
result
from
it
will
be
as
dear
he
said
abruptly
and
must
confess
to
having
been
unjust
to
the
austrians
and
especially
to
what
what
what
knowledge
of
the
what
foresight
for
every
every
possibility
even
to
the
smallest
my
dear
no
conditions
better
than
our
present
ones
could
have
been
this
combination
of
austrian
precision
with
russian
more
could
be
wished
the
attack
is
definitely
resolved
asked
do
you
my
dear
it
seems
to
me
that
bonaparte
has
decidedly
lost
you
know
that
a
letter
was
received
from
him
today
for
the
dolgorukov
smiled
that
and
what
did
he
inquired
can
he
and
so
merely
to
gain
i
tell
you
he
is
in
our
but
what
was
most
he
with
a
that
we
could
not
think
how
to
address
the
if
not
as
and
of
course
not
as
it
seemed
to
me
it
should
be
to
between
not
recognizing
him
as
emperor
and
calling
him
general
there
is
a
remarked
just
interrupted
dolgorukov
know
a
very
clever
he
suggested
addressing
him
as
and
enemy
of
dolgorukov
laughed
said
the
it
was
bilibin
who
found
a
suitable
form
for
the
he
is
a
wise
and
clever
was
the
head
of
the
french
au
chef
du
gouvernement
said
with
grave
but
he
will
dislike
it
said
very
my
brother
knows
dined
with
present
than
once
in
and
tells
me
he
never
met
a
more
cunning
or
subtle
a
combination
of
french
adroitness
and
italian
do
you
know
the
tale
about
him
and
count
count
markov
was
the
only
man
who
knew
how
to
handle
you
know
the
story
of
the
it
is
and
the
talkative
turning
now
to
now
to
prince
told
how
bonaparte
wishing
to
test
our
purposely
dropped
a
handkerchief
in
front
of
him
and
stood
looking
at
probably
expecting
markov
to
pick
it
up
for
and
how
markov
immediately
dropped
his
own
beside
it
and
picked
it
up
without
touching
said
i
have
come
to
as
a
petitioner
on
behalf
of
this
young
you
but
before
prince
andrew
could
an
came
in
to
summon
dolgorukov
to
the
what
a
said
getting
up
hurriedly
and
pressing
the
hands
of
prince
andrew
and
know
i
should
be
very
glad
to
do
all
in
my
power
both
for
you
and
for
this
dear
young
again
he
pressed
the
hand
of
the
latter
with
an
expression
of
and
animated
you
another
boris
was
excited
by
the
thought
of
being
so
close
to
the
higher
powers
as
he
felt
himself
to
be
at
that
he
was
conscious
that
here
he
was
in
contact
with
the
springs
that
set
in
motion
the
enormous
movements
of
the
mass
of
which
in
his
regiment
he
felt
himself
a
and
insignificant
they
followed
prince
dolgorukov
out
into
the
corridor
and
out
of
the
door
of
the
room
by
which
dolgorukov
had

in
civilian
clothes
with
a
clever
face
and
sharply
projecting
jaw
without
spoiling
his

him
a
peculiar
vivacity
and
shiftiness
of
this
short
man
nodded
to
dolgorukov
as
to
an
intimate
friend
and
stared
at
prince
andrew
with
cool
walking
straight
toward
him
and
evidently
expecting
him
to
bow
or
to
step
out
of
his
prince
andrew
did
a
look
of
animosity
appeared
on
his
face
and
the
other
turned
away
and
went
down
the
side
of
the

asked
is
one
of
the
most
but
to
me
most
unpleasant
of
minister
of
foreign
prince
adam
it
is
such
men
as
he
who
decide
the
fate
of
added
bolkonski
with
a
sigh
he
could
not

they
passed
out
of
the
next
the
army
began
its
and
up
to
the
very
battle
of
boris
was
unable
to
see
either
prince
andrew
or
dolgorukov
again
and
remained
for
a
while
with
the
ismaylov
chapter
x
at
dawn
on
the
sixteenth
of
in
which
nicholas
rostov
served
and
which
was
in

from
the
place
where
it
had
spent

after
going
behind
other
columns
for
about
two
thirds
of
a
mile
was
stopped
on

then
the
first
and
second
squadrons
of
hussars

infantry

artillery
pass
by

go
forward
and
then
generals
bagration
and
dolgorukov
ride
past
with
their
all
the
fear
before
action
which
he
had
experienced
as
all
the
inner
struggle
to
conquer
that
all
his
dreams
of
distinguishing
himself
as
a
true
hussar
in
this
had
been
their
squadron
remained
in
reserve
and
nicholas
rostov
spent
that
day
in
a
dull
and
wretched
at
nine

heard
firing
in
front
and
shouts
of

saw

brought
back

not

at
last
he
saw
how
a
whole
detachment
of
french
cavalry
was
brought
convoyed
by
a
sotnya
of
evidently
the
affair
was
over
though
not
had
been

successful

of
a
brilliant
of
the
occupation
of

town

the
capture
of
a
whole
french
the
day
was
bright
and
sunny
after
a
sharp
night
and
the
cheerful
glitter
of
that
autumn
day
was
in
keeping
with
the
news
of
victory
which
was
not
only
by
the
tales
of
those
who
had
taken
part
in
but
also
by
the
joyful
expression
on
the
faces
of
and
as
they
passed
rostov
going
or
and
who
had
vainly
suffered
all
the
dread
that
precedes
a
battle

had
spent
that
happy
day
in

all
the
more
dwink
to
dwown
our
shouted
who
had
settled
down
by
the
roadside
with
a
flask
and
some
the
officers
gathered
round
eating
and
they
are
bringing
cried
one
of
the
indicating
a
captive
french
dragoon
who
was
being
brought
in
on
foot
by
two
one
of
them
was
leading
by
the
bridle
a
fine
large
french
horse
he
had
taken
from
the
us
that
denisov
called
out
to
the
you
your
the
officers
got
up
and
stood
round
the
cossacks
and
their
the
french
dragoon
was
a
young
alsatian
who
spoke
french
with
a
german
he
was
breathless
with
his
face
was
and
when
he
heard
some
french
spoken
he
at
once
began
speaking
to
the
addressing
first
then
he
said
he
would
not
have
been
it
was
not
his
fault
but
the
who
had
sent
him
to
seize
some
though
he
had
told
him
the
russians
were
and
at
every
word
he
hurt
my
little
and
stroked
the
it
was
plain
that
he
did
not
quite
grasp
where
he
now
he
excused
himself
for
having
been
taken
prisoner
and
imagining
himself
before
his
own
insisted
on
his
soldierly
discipline
and
zeal
in
the
he
brought
with
him
into
our
rearguard
all
the
freshness
of
atmosphere
of
the
french
which
was
so
alien
to
the
cossacks
sold
the
horse
for
two
gold
and
being
the
richest
of
the
officers
now
that
he
had
received
his
bought
hurt
my
little
said
the
alsatian
to
rostov
when
the
animal
was
handed
over
to
the
rostov
smilingly
reassured
the
dragoon
and
gave
him
said
the
touching
the
arm
to
make
him
go
the
was
suddenly
heard
among
the
all
began
to
run
and
and
rostov
saw
coming
up
the
road
behind
him
several
riders
with
white
plumes
in
their
in
a
moment
everyone
was
in
his
rostov
did
not
know
or
remember
how
he
ran
to
his
place
and
instantly
his
regret
at
not
having
been
in
action
and
his
dejected
mood
amid
people
of
whom
he
was
weary
had
instantly
every
thought
of
himself
had
he
was
filled
with
happiness
at
his
nearness
to
the
he
felt
that
this
nearness
by
itself
made
up
to
him
for
the
day
he
had
he
was
happy
as
a
lover
when
the
moment
of
meeting
not
daring
to
look
round
and
without
looking
he
was
ecstatically
conscious
of
his
he
felt
it
not
only
from
the
sound
of
the
hoofs
of
the
approaching
but
because
as
he
drew
near
everything
grew
more
more
and
more
festive
around
nearer
and
nearer
to
rostov
came
that
sun
shedding
beams
of
mild
and
majestic
light
and
already
he
felt
himself
enveloped
in
those
he
heard
his
that
and
majestic
voice
that
was
yet
so
and
as
if
in
accord
with
there
was
a
deathly
stillness
amid
which
was
heard
the
pavlograd
he
replied
a
a
very
human
one
compared
to
that
which
had
pavlograd
the
emperor
drew
level
with
rostov
and
face
was
even
more
beautiful
than
it
had
been
three
days
before
at
the
it
shone
with
such
gaiety
and
such
innocent
that
it
suggested
the
liveliness
of
a
and
yet
it
was
the
face
of
the
majestic
while
surveying
the
the
eyes
met
and
rested
on
them
for
not
more
than
two
whether
or
no
the
emperor
understood
what
was
going
on
in
soul
seemed
to
rostov
that
he
understood
at
any
rate
his
eyes
gazed
for
about
two
seconds
into
a
mild
light
poured
from
then
all
at
once
he
raised
his
abruptly
touched
his
horse
with
his
left
and
galloped
the
younger
emperor
could
not
restrain
his
wish
to
be
present
at
the
battle
in
spite
of
the
remonstrances
of
his
at
twelve
left
the
third
column
with
which
he
had
been
and
galloped
toward
the
before
he
came
up
with
the
several
adjutants
met
him
with
news
of
the
successful
result
of
the
this
which
consisted
in
the
capture
of
a
french
was
represented
as
a
brilliant
victory
over
the
and
so
the
emperor
and
the
whole
especially
while
the
smoke
hung
over
the
believed
that
the
french
had
been
defeated
and
were
retreating
against

a
few
minutes
after
the
emperor
had
the
pavlograd

was
ordered
to
in
wischau
a
petty
german
rostov
saw
the
emperor
in
the
market
where
there
had
been
some
rather
heavy
firing
before
the
lay
several
killed
and
wounded
soldiers
whom
there
had
not
been
time
to
the
surrounded
by
his
suite
of
officers
and
was
riding
a
bobtailed
chestnut
a
different
one
from
that
which
he
had
ridden
at
the
and
bending
to
one
side
he
gracefully
held
a
gold
lorgnette
to
his
eyes
and
looked
at
a
soldier
who
lay
with
blood
on
his
uncovered
the
wounded
soldier
was
so
and
revolting
that
his
proximity
to
the
emperor
shocked
rostov
saw
how
the
rather
round
shoulders
shuddered
as
if
a
cold
shiver
had
run
down
how
his
left
foot
began
convulsively
tapping
the
side
with
the
and
how
the
horse
looked
round
unconcerned
and
did
not
an
lifted
the
soldier
under
the
arms
to
place
him
on
a
stretcher
that
had
been
the
soldier
you
do
it
more
said
the
emperor
apparently
suffering
more
than
the
dying
and
he
rode
rostov
saw
tears
filling
the
eyes
and
heard
as
he
was
riding
say
to
a
terrible
thing

what

the
troops

gratitude

the
men
received
a
double

and
the
songs
resounded

more
merrily
than
on
the

enthusiastic
voices
of
the
and

enthusiastically
and
no
less
sincerely
than
the
when
the
officers
had
emptied
and
smashed
their
kirsten
filled
others
in
shirt
sleeves
and
went
glass
in
hand
to
the
bonfires
and
with
his
long
gray
his
white
chest
showing
under
his
open

stood
in
a
majestic
pose

the
light
of
the
waving

uplifted
to

and
victory

exclaimed
in
his
the
hussars
crowded
round

responded
heartily

loud
late
that
when

his
short
hand

such

you
and
rostov
got
up
and
went
wandering
among
the
dreaming
of
what
happiness
it
would
be
to
in
saving
the
life
did
not
even
dare
to
dream
of
but
simply
to
die
before
his
he
really
was
in
love
with
the
tsar
and
the
glory
of
the
russian
arms
and
the
hope
of
future
and
he
was
not
the
only
man
to
experience
that
feeling
during
those
memorable
days
preceding
the
battle
of
nine
tenths
of
the
men
in
the
russian
army
were
then
in
though
less
with
their
tsar
and
the
glory
of
the
russian
chapter
xi
the
next
day
the
emperor
stopped
at
and
his
was
repeatedly
summoned
to
see
at
headquarters
and
among
the
troops
near
by
the
news
spread
that
the
emperor
was
he
ate
nothing
and
had
slept
badly
that
those
around
him
the
cause
of
this
indisposition
was
the
strong
impression
made
on
his
sensitive
mind
by
the
sight
of
the
killed
and
at
daybreak
on
the
a
french
officer
who
had
come
with
a
flag
of
demanding
an
audience

brought
into

just
fallen
asleep

was
admitted
to
the
and
an
hour
later
he
rode
off
with
prince
dolgorukov
to
the
advanced
post
of
the
french
it
was
rumored
that
savary
had
been
sent
to
propose
to
alexander
a
meeting
with
to
the
joy
and
pride
of
the
whole
a
personal
interview
was
and
instead
of
the
prince
the
victor
at
was
sent
with
savary
to
negotiate
with
napoleon
contrary
to
these
negotiations
were
actuated
by
a
real
desire
for
toward
evening
dolgorukov
came
went
straight
to
the
and
remained
alone
with
him
for
a
long
on
the
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
of
the
army
advanced
two
march
and
the
outposts
after
a
brief
interchange
of
shots
in
the
highest
army
circles
from
midday
on
the
a
excitedly
bustling
activity
began
which
lasted
till
the
morning
of
the
when
the
memorable
battle
of
austerlitz
was
till
midday
on
the
the
eager
running
to
and
and
dispatching
of
confined
to
the
but
on
the
afternoon
of
that
this
activity
reached
headquarters
and
the
staffs
of
the
commanders
of
by
the
adjutants
had
spread
it
to
all
ends
and
parts
of
the
and
in
the
night
from
the
nineteenth
to
the
the
whole
eighty
thousand
allied
troops
rose
from
their
bivouacs
to
the
hum
of
and
the
army
swayed
and
started
in
one
enormous
mass
six
miles
the
concentrated
activity
which
had
begun
at
the
headquarters
in
the
morning
and
had
started
the
whole
movement
that
followed
was
like
the
first
movement
of
the
main
wheel
of
a
large
tower
one
wheel
slowly
another
was
set
in
and
a
and
wheels
began
to
revolve
faster
and
levers
and
cogwheels
to
chimes
to
figures
to
pop
and
the
hands
to
advance
with
regular
motion
as
a
result
of
all
that
just
as
in
the
mechanism
of
a
so
in
the
mechanism
of
the
military
an
impulse
once
given
leads
to
the
final
and
just
as
indifferently
quiescent
till
the
moment
when
motion
is
transmitted
to
them
are
the
parts
of
the
mechanism
which
the
impulse
has
not
yet
wheels
creak
on
their
axles
as
the
cogs
engage
one
another
and
the
revolving
pulleys
whirr
with
the
rapidity
of
their
but
a
neighboring
wheel
is
as
quiet
and
motionless
as
though
it
were
prepared
to
remain
so
for
a
hundred
but
the
moment
comes
when
the
lever
catches
it
and
obeying
the
impulse
that
wheel
begins
to
creak
and
joins
in
the
common
motion
the
result
and
aim
of
which
are
beyond
its
just
as
in
a
the
result
of
the
complicated
motion
of
innumerable
wheels
and
pulleys
is
merely
a
slow
and
regular
movement
of
the
hands
which
show
the
so
the
result
of
all
the
complicated
human
activities
of
russians
and
their
outbursts
of
and
only
the
loss
of
the
battle
of
the
battle
of
the
three
is
to
a
slow
movement
of
the
hand
on
the
dial
of
human
prince
andrew
was
on
duty
that
day
and
in
constant
attendance
on
the
at
six
in
the
kutuzov
went
to
the
headquarters
and
after
staying
but
a
short
time
with
the
tsar
went
to
see
the
grand
marshal
of
the
count
bolkonski
took
the
opportunity
to
go
in
to
get
some
details
of
the
coming
action
from
he
felt
that
kutuzov
was
upset
and
dissatisfied
about
something
and
that
at
headquarters
they
were
dissatisfied
with
and
also
that
at
the
headquarters
everyone
adopted
toward
him
the
tone
of
men
who
know
something
others
do
not
he
therefore
wished
to
speak
to
how
my
dear
said
who
was
sitting
at
tea
with
fete
is
for
how
is
your
old
out
of
say
he
is
out
of
but
i
fancy
he
would
like
to
be
they
heard
him
at
the
council
of
war
and
will
hear
him
when
he
talks
but
to
temporize
and
wait
for
something
now
when
bonaparte
fears
nothing
so
much
as
a
general
battle
is
you
have
seen
said
prince
what
is
bonaparte
how
did
he
impress
i
saw
and
am
convinced
that
he
fears
nothing
so
much
as
a
general
repeated
evidently
prizing
this
general
conclusion
which
he
had
arrived
at
from
his
interview
with
he
afraid
of
a
battle
why
did
he
ask
for
that
why
and
above
all
why
when
to
retreat
is
so
contrary
to
his
method
of
conducting
believe
he
is
afraid
of
a
general
his
hour
has
mark
my
tell
what
is
he
said
prince
andrew
is
a
man
in
a
gray
very
anxious
that
i
should
call
him
but
to
his
got
no
title
from
the
sort
of
man
he
and
nothing
replied
looking
round
at
bilibin
with
a
my
great
respect
for
old
he
should
be
a
nice
set
of
fellows
if
we
were
to
wait
about
and
so
give
him
a
chance
to
or
to
trick
now
that
we
certainly
have
him
in
our
we
forget
suvorov
and
his
to
put
yourself
in
a
position
to
be
but
yourself
to
believe
me
in
war
the
energy
of
young
men
often
shows
the
way
better
than
all
the
experience
of
old
in
what
position
are
we
going
to
attack
i
have
been
at
the
outposts
today
and
it
is
impossible
to
say
where
his
chief
forces
are
said
prince
he
wished
to
explain
to
dolgorukov
a
plan
of
attack
he
had
himself
that
is
all
the
dolgorukov
said
and
getting
up
he
spread
a
map
on
the
eventualities
have
been
if
he
is
standing
before
and
prince
dolgorukov
rapidly
but
indistinctly
explained
plan
of
a
flanking
prince
andrew
began
to
reply
and
to
state
his
own
which
might
have
been
as
good
as
but
for
the
disadvantage
that
had
already
been
as
soon
as
prince
andrew
began
to
demonstrate
the
defects
of
the
latter
and
the
merits
of
his
own
prince
dolgorukov
ceased
to
listen
to
him
and
gazed
not
at
the
but
at
prince
will
be
a
council
of
war
at
you
can
say
all
this
remarked
will
do
said
prince
moving
away
from
the
are
you
bothering
said
till
had
listened
with
an
amused
smile
to
their
conversation
and
now
was
evidently
ready
with
a
tomorrow
brings
victory
or
the
glory
of
our
russian
arms
is
except
your
there
is
not
a
single
russian
in
command
of
a
the
commanders
herr
general
le
comte
de
le
prince
de
le
de
and
finally
and
so
on
like
all
those
polish
said
is
not
there
are
now
two
and
and
there
would
be
a
count
if
his
nerves
were
not
too
i
think
general
kutuzov
has
come
said
prince
wish
you
good
luck
and
he
added
and
went
out
after
shaking
hands
with
dolgorukov
and
on
the
way
prince
andrew
could
not
refrain
from
asking
who
was
sitting
silently
beside
what
he
thought
of
kutuzov
looked
sternly
at
his
adjutant
after
a
think
the
battle
will
be
and
so
i
told
count
tolstoy
and
asked
him
to
tell
the
what
do
you
think
he
my
dear
i
am
engaged
with
rice
and
look
after
military
matters
that
was
the
answer
i
chapter
xii
shortly
after
nine
that
weyrother
drove
with
his
plans
to
quarters
where
the
council
of
war
was
to
be
all
the
commanders
of
columns
were
summoned
to
the
and
with
the
exception
of
prince
who
declined
to
were
all
there
at
the
appointed
who
was
in
full
control
of
the
proposed
by
his
eagerness
and
briskness
presented
a
marked
contrast
to
the
dissatisfied
and
drowsy
who
reluctantly
played
the
part
of
chairman
and
president
of
the
council
of
weyrother
evidently
felt
himself
to
be
at
the
head
of
a
movement
that
had
already
become
he
was
like
a
horse
running
downhill
harnessed
to
a
heavy
whether
he
was
pulling
it
or
being
pushed
by
it
he
did
not
but
rushed
along
at
headlong
speed
with
no
time
to
consider
what
this
movement
might
lead
weyrother
had
been
twice
that
evening
to
the
picket
line
to
reconnoiter
and
twice
to
the
russian
and
to
report
and
and
to
his
headquarters
where
he
had
dictated
the
dispositions
in
and
much
he
arrived
at
he
was
evidently
so
busy
that
he
even
forgot
to
be
polite
to
the
commander
in
he
interrupted
talked
rapidly
and
without
looking
at
the
man
he
was
and
did
not
reply
to
questions
put
to
he
was
bespattered
with
mud
and
had
a
and
distracted
though
at
the
same
time
he
was
haughty
and
kutuzov
was
occupying
a
castle
of
modest
dimensions
near
in
the
large
drawing
room
which
had
become
the
commander
in
office
were
gathered
kutuzov
and
the
members
of
the
council
of
they
were
drinking
and
only
awaited
prince
bagration
to
begin
the
at
last
orderly
came
with
the
news
that
the
prince
could
not
prince
andrew
came
in
to
inform
the
of
this
availing
himself
of
permission
previously
given
him
by
kutuzov
to
be
present
at
the
he
remained
in
the
prince
bagration
is
not
we
may
said
hurriedly
rising
from
his
seat
and
going
up
to
the
table
on
which
an
enormous
map
of
the
environs
of
brunn
was
spread
with
his
uniform
unbuttoned
so
that
his
fat
neck
bulged
over
his
collar
as
if
was
sitting
almost
asleep
in
a
low
with
his
podgy
old
hands
resting
symmetrically
on
its
at
the
sound
of
he
opened
his
one
eye
with
an
if
you
it
is
already
said
and
nodding
his
head
he
let
it
droop
and
again
closed
his
if
at
first
the
members
of
the
council
thought
that
kutuzov
was
pretending
to
the
sounds
his
nose
emitted
during
the
reading
that
followed
proved
that
the
at
that
moment
was
absorbed
by
a
far
more
serious
matter
than
a
desire
to
show
his
contempt
for
the
dispositions
or
anything
was
engaged
in
satisfying
the
irresistible
human
need
for
he
really
was
with
the
gesture
of
a
man
too
busy
to
lose
a
glanced
at
kutuzov
having
convinced
himself
that
he
was
took
up
a
paper
and
in
a
monotonous
voice
began
to
read
out
the
dispositions
for
the
impending
under
a
heading
which
he
also
read
for
an
attack
on
the
enemy
position
behind
kobelnitz
and
november
the
dispositions
were
very
complicated
and
they
began
as
the
left
wing
rests
on
wooded
hills
and
his
right
extends
along
kobelnitz
and
sokolnitz
behind
the
ponds
that
are
while
on
the
other
with
our
left
wing
by
far
outflank
his
it
is
advantageous
to
attack
the
latter
wing
especially
if
we
occupy
the
villages
of
sokolnitz
and
whereby
we
can
both
fall
on
his
flank
and
pursue
him
over
the
plain
between
schlappanitz
and
the
thuerassa
avoiding
the
defiles
of
schlappanitz
and
bellowitz
which
cover
the
for
this
object
it
is
necessary
the
first
column
the
second
column
the
third
column
and
so
read
the
generals
seemed
to
listen
reluctantly
to
the
difficult
the
general
buxhowden
leaning
his
back
against
the
his
eyes
fixed
on
a
burning
and
seemed
not
to
listen
or
even
to
wish
to
be
thought
to
exactly
opposite
with
his
glistening
eyes
fixed
upon
him
and
his
mustache
twisted
sat
the
ruddy
miloradovich
in
a
military
his
elbows
turned
his
hands
on
his
and
his
shoulders
he
remained
stubbornly
gazing
at
and
only
turned
away
his
eyes
when
the
austrian
chief
of
staff
finished
then
miloradovich
looked
round
significantly
at
the
other
but
one
could
not
tell
from
that
significant
look
whether
he
agreed
or
disagreed
and
was
satisfied
or
not
with
the
next
to
weyrother
sat
count
langeron
with
a
subtle
smile
that
never
left
his
typically
southern
french
face
during
the
whole
time
of
the
gazed
at
his
delicate
fingers
which
rapidly
twirled
by
its
corners
a
gold
snuffbox
on
which
was
a
in
the
middle
of
one
of
the
longest
he
stopped
the
rotary
motion
of
the
raised
his
and
with
inimical
politeness
lurking
in
the
corners
of
his
thin
lips
interrupted
wishing
to
say
but
the
austrian
continuing
to
frowned
angrily
and
jerked
his
as
if
to
can
tell
me
your
views
but
now
be
so
good
as
to
look
at
the
map
and
langeron
lifted
his
eyes
with
an
expression
of
turned
round
to
miloradovich
as
if
seeking
an
but
meeting
the
impressive
but
meaningless
gaze
drooped
his
eyes
sadly
and
again
took
to
twirling
his
geography
he
muttered
as
if
to
but
loud
enough
to
be
with
respectful
but
dignified
held
his
hand
to
his
ear
toward
with
the
air
of
a
man
absorbed
in
a
little
sat
opposite
with
an
assiduous
and
modest
and
stooping
over
the
outspread
map
conscientiously
studied
the
dispositions
and
the
unfamiliar
he
asked
weyrother
several
times
to
repeat
words
he
had
not
clearly
heard
and
the
difficult
names
of
weyrother
complied
and
dohkturov
noted
them
when
the
reading
which
lasted
more
than
an
hour
was
langeron
again
brought
his
snuffbox
to
rest
without
looking
at
weyrother
or
at
anyone
in
began
to
say
how
difficult
it
was
to
carry
out
such
a
plan
in
which
the
position
was
assumed
to
be
whereas
it
was
perhaps
not
since
the
enemy
was
in
objections
were
valid
but
it
was
obvious
that
their
chief
aim
was
to
show
general
had
read
his
dispositions
with
as
much
as
if
he
were
addressing
school
he
had
to
not
with
but
with
men
who
could
teach
him
something
in
military
when
the
monotonous
sound
of
voice
kutuzov
opened
his
eye
as
a
miller
wakes
up
when
the
soporific
drone
of
the
mill
wheel
is
he
listened
to
what
langeron
as
if
you
are
still
at
that
silly
quickly
closed
his
eye
and
let
his
head
sink
still
trying
as
virulently
as
possible
to
sting
vanity
as
author
of
the
military
argued
that
bonaparte
might
easily
attack
instead
of
being
and
so
render
the
whole
of
this
plan
perfectly
weyrother
met
all
objections
with
a
firm
and
contemptuous
evidently
prepared
beforehand
to
meet
all
objections
be
they
what
they
he
could
attack
he
would
have
done
so
said
you
think
he
is
said
has
forty
thousand
men
at
replied
with
the
smile
of
a
doctor
to
whom
an
old
wife
wishes
to
explain
the
treatment
of
a
that
case
he
is
inviting
his
doom
by
awaiting
our
said
with
a
subtly
ironical
again
glancing
round
for
support
to
miloradovich
who
was
near
but
miloradovich
was
at
that
moment
evidently
thinking
of
anything
rather
than
of
what
the
generals
were
disputing
said
we
shall
see
all
that
on
the
weyrother
again
gave
that
smile
which
seemed
to
say
that
to
him
it
was
strange
and
ridiculous
to
meet
objections
from
russian
generals
and
to
have
to
prove
to
them
what
he
had
not
merely
convinced
himself
but
had
also
convinced
the
sovereign
emperors
enemy
has
quenched
his
fires
and
a
continual
noise
is
heard
from
his
said
does
that
either
he
is
which
is
the
only
thing
we
need
or
he
is
changing
his
smiled
even
if
he
also
took
up
a
position
in
the
he
merely
saves
us
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
all
our
arrangements
to
the
minutest
detail
remain
the
is
began
prince
who
had
for
long
been
waiting
an
opportunity
to
express
his
kutuzov
here
woke
coughed
and
looked
round
at
the
the
dispositions
for
rather
for
for
it
is
past
now
be
said
have
heard
and
we
shall
all
do
our
but
before
a
there
is
nothing
more
he
to
have
a
good
he
moved
as
if
to
the
generals
bowed
and
it
was
past
prince
andrew
went
the
council
of
at
which
prince
andrew
had
not
been
able
to
express
his
opinion
as
he
had
hoped
left
on
him
a
vague
and
uneasy
whether
dolgorukov
and
or
and
the
others
who
did
not
approve
of
the
plan
of
were
did
not
was
it
really
not
possible
for
kutuzov
to
state
his
views
plainly
to
the
is
it
possible
that
on
account
of
court
and
personal
considerations
tens
of
thousands
of
and
my
my
he
be
it
is
very
likely
that
i
shall
be
killed

at
this

of
a
whole
series
of
most
most
memories
rose
in
his
he
remembered
his
last
parting
from
his
father
and
his
he
remembered
the
days
when
he
first
loved
he
thought
of
her
pregnancy
and
felt
sorry
for
her
and
for
and
in
a
nervously
emotional
and
softened
mood
he
went
out
of
the
hut
in
which
he
was
billeted
with
nesvitski
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
before
the
night
was
foggy
and
through
the
fog
the
moonlight
gleamed
he
everything
may
be
over
for
all
these
memories
will
be
no
none
of
them
will
have
any
meaning
for
tomorrow
even
i
have
a
presentiment
that
for
the
first
time
i
shall
have
to
show
all
i
can
and
his
fancy
pictured
the
its
the
concentration
of
fighting
at
one
and
the
hesitation
of
all
the
and
then
that
happy
that
toulon
for
which
he
had
so
long
presents
itself
to
him
at
he
firmly
and
clearly
expresses
his
opinion
to
to
and
to
the
all
are
struck
by
the
justness
of
his
but
no
one
undertakes
to
carry
them
so
he
takes
a
a
that
no
one
is
to
interfere
with
his
his
division
to
the
decisive
and
gains
the
victory
death
and
suggested
another
prince
did
not
answer
that
voice
and
went
on
dreaming
of
his
the
dispositions
for
the
next
battle
are
planned
by
him
nominally
he
is
only
an
adjutant
on
but
he
does
everything
the
next
battle
is
won
by
him
kutuzov
is
removed
and
he
is
and
asked
the
other
before
that
you
are
not
ten
times
or
what
prince
andrew
answered
know
what
will
happen
and
want
to
and
but
if
i
want
want
to
be
known
to
want
to
be
loved
by
it
is
not
my
fault
that
i
want
it
and
want
nothing
but
that
and
live
only
for
for
that
i
shall
never
tell
oh
what
am
i
to
do
if
i
love
nothing
but
fame
and
the
loss
of
fear
and
precious
and
dear
as
many
persons
are
to
dearest
to
dreadful
and
unnatural
as
it
i
would
give
them
all
at
once
for
a
moment
of
of
triumph
over
of
love
from
men
i
know
and
never
shall
for
the
love
of
these
men
he
as
he
listened
to
voices
in
the
voices
were
those
of
the
orderlies
who
were
packing
one
probably
a
was
teasing
old
cook
whom
prince
andrew
and
who
was
called
he
was
i
returned
the
old
thresh
a
said
the
go
to
the
called
out
a
drowned
by
the
laughter
of
the
orderlies
and
the
i
love
and
value
nothing
but
triumph
over
them
i
value
this
mystic
power
and
glory
that
is
floating
here
above
me
in
this
chapter
xiii
that
same
rostov
was
with
a
platoon
on
skirmishing
duty
in
front
of
his
hussars
were
placed
along
the
line
in
couples
and
he
himself
rode
along
the
line
trying
to
master
the
sleepiness
that
kept
coming
over
an
enormous
with
our
campfires
dimly
glowing
in
the
could
be
seen
behind
in
front
of
him
was
misty
rostov
could
see
peer
as
he
would
into
that
foggy
now
something
gleamed
now
there
was
something
now
little
lights
seemed
to
glimmer
where
the
enemy
ought
to
now
he
fancied
it
was
only
something
in
his
own
his
eyes
kept
and
in
his
fancy
the
now
and
now
moscow
he
again
hurriedly
opened
his
eyes
and
saw
close
before
him
the
head
and
ears
of
the
horse
he
was
and
when
he
came
within
six
paces
of
the
black
figures
of
but
in
the
distance
was
still
the
same
misty
it
might
easily
thought
the
emperor
will
meet
me
and
give
me
an
order
as
he
would
to
any
other
and
find
out
there
are
many
stories
of
his
getting
to
know
an
officer
in
just
such
a
chance
way
and
attaching
him
to
what
if
he
gave
me
a
place
near
how
i
would
guard
how
i
would
tell
him
the
how
i
would
unmask
his
and
in
order
to
realize
vividly
his
love
devotion
to
the
rostov
pictured
to
himself
an
enemy
or
a
deceitful
whom
he
would
not
only
kill
with
pleasure
but
whom
he
would
slap
in
the
face
before
the
suddenly
a
distant
shout
aroused
he
started
and
opened
his
am
oh
in
the
skirmishing
pass
and
what
a
nuisance
that
our
squadron
will
be
in
reserve
he
ask
leave
to
go
to
the
this
may
be
my
only
chance
of
seeing
the
it
be
long
now
before
i
am
off
take
another
turn
and
when
i
get
back
go
to
the
general
and
ask
he
readjusted
himself
in
the
saddle
and
touched
up
his
horse
to
ride
once
more
round
his
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
was
getting
to
the
left
he
saw
a
sloping
descent
lit
and
facing
it
a
black
knoll
that
seemed
as
steep
as
a
on
this
knoll
there
was
a
white
patch
that
rostov
could
not
at
all
make
was
it
a
glade
in
the
wood
lit
up
by
the
or
some
unmelted
or
some
white
he
even
thought
something
moved
on
that
white
expect
that
a
he
not
a
black
she
be
surprised
when
i
tell
her
how
seen
the
take
my
to
the
your
there
are
bushes
came
the
voice
of
an
past
whom
rostov
was
riding
in
the
act
of
falling
rostov
lifted
his
head
that
had
sunk
almost
to
his
mane
and
pulled
up
beside
the
he
was
succumbing
to
childish
what
was
i
i
how
shall
i
speak
to
the
not
oh
saber
the
the
hussars
with
along
the
tverskaya
street
rode
the
hussar
with
i
thought
about
him
just
opposite
old
but
a
fine
but
all
the
chief
thing
is
that
the
emperor
is
how
he
looked
at
me
and
wished
to
say
but
dared
it
was
i
who
dared
but
the
chief
thing
is
not
to
forget
the
important
thing
i
was
thinking
and
his
head
once
more
sank
to
his
all
at
once
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
being
fired
cut
them
said
waking
at
the
moment
he
opened
his
eyes
he
heard
in
front
of
where
the
enemy
the
shouts
of
thousands
of
his
horse
and
the
horse
of
the
hussar
near
him
pricked
their
ears
at
these
over
where
the
shouting
came
a
fire
flared
up
and
went
out
then
and
all
along
the
french
line
on
the
hill
fires
flared
up
and
the
shouting
grew
louder
and
rostov
could
hear
the
sound
of
french
words
but
could
not
distinguish
the
din
of
many
voices
was
too
all
he
could
hear
and
what
do
you
make
of
said
rostov
to
the
hussar
beside
must
be
the
the
hussar
did
not
you
hear
rostov
asked
after
waiting
for
a
can
your
replied
the
hussar
the
it
must
be
the
repeated
may
be
he
or
it
may
be
muttered
the
he
cried
to
his
fidgeting
horse
was
also
getting
it
pawed
the
frozen
pricking
its
ears
at
the
noise
and
looking
at
the
the
shouting
grew
still
louder
and
merged
into
a
general
roar
that
only
an
army
of
several
thousand
men
could
the
lights
spread
farther
and
probably
along
the
line
of
the
french
rostov
no
longer
wanted
to
the
gay
triumphant
shouting
of
the
enemy
army
had
a
stimulating
effect
on
he
now
heard
be
far
probably
just
beyond
the
he
said
to
the
hussar
beside
the
hussar
only
sighed
without
replying
and
coughed
the
sound
of
hoofs
approaching
at
a
trot
along
the
line
of
hussars
was
and
out
of
the
foggy
darkness
the
figure
of
a
sergeant
of
hussars
suddenly
looming
huge
as
an
the
said
the
riding
up
to
still
looking
round
toward
the
fires
and
the
rode
with
the
sergeant
to
meet
some
mounted
men
who
were
riding
along
the
one
was
on
a
white
prince
bagration
and
prince
dolgorukov
with
their
adjutants
had
come
to
witness
the
curious
phenomenon
of
the
lights
and
shouts
in
the
rostov
rode
up
to
reported
to
and
then
joined
the
adjutants
listening
to
what
the
generals
were
said
prince
addressing
is
nothing
but
a
he
has
retreated
and
ordered
the
rearguard
to
kindle
fires
and
make
a
noise
to
deceive
said
saw
them
this
evening
on
that
if
they
had
retreated
they
would
have
withdrawn
from
that
said
bagration
to
the
skirmishers
still
were
there
this
but
now
i
your
shall
i
go
with
some
of
my
hussars
to
replied
bagration
stopped
before
tried
to
see
face
in
the
go
and
he
after
a
rostov
spurred
his
called
to
sergeant
fedchenko
and
two
other
told
them
to
follow
and
trotted
downhill
in
the
direction
from
which
the
shouting
he
felt
both
frightened
and
pleased
to
be
riding
alone
with
three
hussars
into
that
mysterious
and
dangerous
misty
distance
where
no
one
had
been
before
bagration
called
to
him
from
the
hill
not
to
go
beyond
the
but
rostov
pretended
not
to
hear
him
and
did
not
stop
but
rode
on
and
continually
mistaking
bushes
for
trees
and
gullies
for
men
and
continually
discovering
his
having
descended
the
hill
at
a
he
no
longer
saw
either
our
own
or
the
but
heard
the
shouting
of
the
french
more
loudly
and
in
the
valley
he
saw
before
him
something
like
a
but
when
he
reached
it
he
found
it
was
a
having
come
out
onto
the
road
he
reined
in
his
hesitating
whether
to
ride
along
it
or
cross
it
and
ride
over
the
black
field
up
the
to
keep
to
the
road
which
gleamed
white
in
the
mist
would
have
been
safer
because
it
would
be
easier
to
see
people
coming
along
said
crossed
the
and
began
riding
up
the
hill
at
a
gallop
toward
the
point
where
the
french
pickets
had
been
standing
that
there
he
cried
one
of
the
hussars
behind
and
before
rostov
had
time
to
make
out
what
the
black
thing
was
that
had
suddenly
appeared
in
the
there
was
a
followed
by
a
and
a
bullet
whizzing
high
up
in
the
mist
with
a
plaintive
sound
passed
out
of
another
musket
missed
fire
but
flashed
in
the
rostov
turned
his
horse
and
galloped
four
more
reports
followed
at
and
the
bullets
passed
somewhere
in
the
fog
singing
in
different
rostov
reined
in
his
whose
spirits
had
like
his
at
the
and
went
back
at
a
some
some
a
merry
voice
was
saying
in
his
but
no
more
shots
only
when
approaching
bagration
did
rostov
let
his
horse
gallop
and
with
his
hand
at
the
salute
rode
up
to
the
dolgorukov
was
still
insisting
that
the
french
had
retreated
and
had
only
lit
fires
to
deceive
does
that
he
was
saying
as
rostov
rode
might
retreat
and
leave
the
plain
that
they
have
not
all
gone
said
till
tomorrow
find
out
everything
picket
is
still
on
the
your
just
where
it
was
in
the
reported
stooping
forward
with
his
hand
at
the
salute
and
unable
to
repress
the
smile
of
delight
induced
by
his
ride
and
especially
by
the
sound
of
the
very
said
said
i
ask
a
is
our
squadron
is
to
be
in
may
i
ask
to
be
attached
to
the
first
your
very
you
may
stay
in
attendance
on
ilya
asked
but
rostov
did
not
i
may
reckon
on
your
will
give
the
very
likely
i
may
be
sent
with
some
message
to
the
thought
the
fires
and
shouting
in
the
army
were
occasioned
by
the
fact
that
while
proclamation
was
being
read
to
the
troops
the
emperor
himself
rode
round
his
the
on
seeing
lit
wisps
of
straw
and
ran
after
proclamation
was
as
the
russian
army
is
advancing
against
you
to
avenge
the
austrian
army
of
they
are
the
same
battalions
you
broke
at
hollabrunn
and
have
pursued
ever
since
to
this
the
position
we
occupy
is
a
strong
and
while
they
are
marching
to
go
round
me
on
the
right
they
will
expose
a
flank
to
i
will
myself
direct
your
i
will
keep
out
of
fire
if
you
with
your
habitual
valor
carry
disorder
and
confusion
into
the
but
should
victory
be
in
even
for
a
you
will
see
your
emperor
exposing
himself
to
the
first
blows
of
the
for
there
must
be
no
doubt
of
especially
on
this
day
when
what
is
at
stake
is
the
honor
of
the
french
so
necessary
to
the
honor
of
our
do
not
break
your
ranks
on
the
plea
of
removing
the
let
every
man
be
fully
imbued
with
the
thought
that
we
must
defeat
these
hirelings
of
inspired
by
such
hatred
of
our
this
victory
will
conclude
our
campaign
and
we
can
return
to
winter
where
fresh
french
troops
who
are
being
raised
in
france
will
join
and
the
peace
i
shall
conclude
will
be
worthy
of
my
of
and
of
napoleon
chapter
xiv
at
five
in
the
morning
it
was
still
quite
the
troops
of

on

they
were
throwing

cold
and
the
officers
were
hurriedly
drinking
tea
and
the
munching
biscuit
and
beating
a
tattoo
with
their
feet
to
warm
gathering
round
the
fires
throwing
into

the
remains
of

everything
that
they
did
not
want
or
could
not

russian
troops
and
served
as
heralds
of

as
an
austrian
officer
showed
himself

the
monotonous
tramp
of

moved
forward
without

from
the
masses
around

smoke
and

which
they

hemmed
in
and
borne
along
by
his
regiment
as
much
as
a
sailor
is
by
his
however
far
he
has
whatever
and
dangerous
places
he
just
as
a
sailor
is
always
surrounded
by
the
same
and
rigging
of
his

the
soldier
always
has
around
him
the
same
the

the
same

ivan
the
same
company

and
the

on
the
day
of

how
and
stern
note
of

all
are
conscious
sounds
in
the
moral
atmosphere
of
an
announcing
the
approach
of
something
decisive
and
and
awakening
in
the
men
an
unusual
on
the
day
of
battle
the
soldiers
excitedly
try
to
get
beyond
the
interests
of
their
they
listen
look
and
eagerly
ask
concerning
what
is
going
on
around
the
fog
had
grown
so
dense
that
though
it
was
growing
light
they
could
not
see
ten
paces
bushes
looked
like
gigantic
trees
and
level
ground
like
cliffs
and
on
any
one
might
encounter
an
enemy
invisible
ten
paces
but
the
columns
advanced
for
a
long
always
in
the
same
descending
and
ascending
avoiding
gardens
and
going
over
new
and
unknown
and
nowhere
encountering
the
on
the
the
soldiers
became
aware
that
in
and
on
all
other
russian
columns
were
moving
in
the
same
every
soldier
felt
glad
to
know
that
to
the
unknown
place
where
he
was
many
more
of
our
men
were
going
the
kurskies
have
also
gone
was
being
said
in
the
wonderful
what
a
lot
of
our
troops
have
last
night
i
looked
at
the

there
was
no
end
of
a
regular
though
none
of
the

commanders
rode
up

the
ranks
or
talked
to
the
men

we
saw
at
the
council
of

out
of
humor
and
dissatisfied
with
the
and
so
did
not
exert
themselves
to
cheer
the
men
but
merely
carried
out
the
yet
the
troops
marched
as
they
always
do
when
going
into
especially
to
an
but
when
they
had
marched
for
about
an
hour
in
the
dense
the
greater
part
of
the
men
had
to
halt
and
an
unpleasant
consciousness
of
some
dislocation
and
blunder
spread
through
the
how
such
a
consciousness
is
communicated
is
very
difficult
to
but
it
certainly
is
communicated
very
and
flows
and
as
water
does
in
a
had
the
russian
army
been
alone
without
any
it
might
perhaps
have
been
a
long
time
before
this
consciousness
of
mismanagement
became
a
general
but
as
it
the
disorder
was
readily
and
naturally
attributed
to
the
stupid
and
everyone
was
convinced
that
a
dangerous
muddle
had
been
occasioned
by
the
sausage
have
we
is
the
way
or
have
we
already
come
up
against
the
one
hear
be
firing
if
we
were
in
a
hurry
enough
to
start
and
now
here
we
stand
in
the
middle
of
a
field
without
rhyme
or
all
those
damned
what
stupid
send
them
on
in
but
no
crowding
up
and
now
here
we
stand
shall
we
soon
be
they
say
the
cavalry
are
blocking
the
said
an
those
damned
they
know
their
own
said
division
are
shouted
an
riding
why
are
you
you
should
have
gone
on
long
now
you
get
there
till
stupid
they
themselves
know
what
they
are
said
the
officer
and
rode
then
a
general
rode
past
shouting
something
not
in
but
what
jabbering
no
one
can
make
said
a
mimicking
the
general
who
had
ridden
shoot
the
were
ordered
to
be
at
the
place
before
but
we
got
fine
was
being
repeated
on
different
and
the
feeling
of
energy
with
which
the
troops
had
started
began
to
turn
into
vexation
and
anger
at
the
stupid
arrangements
and
at
the
the
cause
of
the
confusion
was
that
while
the
austrian
cavalry
was
moving
toward
our
left
the
higher
command
found
that
our
center
was
too
far
separated
from
our
right
flank
and
the
cavalry
were
all
ordered
to
turn
back
to
the
several
thousand
cavalry
crossed
in
front
of
the
who
had
to
at
the
front
an
altercation
occurred
between
an
austrian
guide
and
a
russian
the
general
shouted
a
demand
that
the
cavalry
should
be
the
austrian
argued
that
not
but
the
higher
was
to
the
troops
meanwhile
stood
growing
listless
and
after
an
delay
they
at
last
moved
descending
the
the
fog
that
was
dispersing
on
the
hill
lay
still
more
densely
where
they
were
in
front
in
the
fog
a
shot
was
heard
and
then
at
first
irregularly
at
varying
then
more
and
more
regularly
and
and
the
action
at
the
goldbach
stream
not
expecting
to
come
on
the
enemy
down
by
the
and
having
stumbled
on
him
in
the
hearing
no
encouraging
word
from
their
and
with
a
consciousness
of
being
too
late
spreading
through
the
and
above
all
being
unable
to
see
anything
in
front
or
around
them
in
the
thick
the
russians
exchanged
shots
with
the
enemy
lazily
and
advanced
and
again
receiving
no
timely
orders
from
the
officers
or
adjutants
who
wandered
about
in
the
fog
in
those
unknown
surroundings
unable
to
find
their
own
in
this
way
the
action
began
for
the
and
third
which
had
gone
down
into
the
the
fourth
with
which
kutuzov
stood
on
the
pratzen
where
the
fight
was
there
was
still
thick
on
the
higher
ground
it
was
but
nothing
could
be
seen
of
what
was
going
on
in
whether
all
the
enemy
forces
as
we
six
miles
or
whether
they
were
near
by
in
that
sea
of
no
one
knew
till
after
eight
it
was
nine
in
the
the
fog
lay
unbroken
like
a
sea
down
but
higher
up
at
the
village
of
schlappanitz
where
napoleon
stood
with
his
marshals
around
it
was
quite
above
him
was
a
clear
blue
and
the
vast
orb
quivered
like
a
huge
crimson
float
on
the
surface
of
that
milky
sea
of
the
whole
french
and
even
napoleon
himself
with
his
were
not
on
the
far
side
of
the
streams
and
hollows
of
sokolnitz
and
schlappanitz
beyond
which
we
intended
to
take
up
our
position
and
begin
the
but
were
on
this
so
close
to
our
own
forces
that
napoleon
with
the
naked
eye
could
distinguish
a
mounted
man
from
one
on
in
the
blue
cloak
which
he
had
worn
on
his
italian
sat
on
his
small
gray
arab
horse
a
little
in
front
of
his
he
gazed
silently
at
the
hills
which
seemed
to
rise
out
of
the
sea
of
mist
and
on
which
the
russian
troops
were
moving
in
the
and
he
listened
to
the
sounds
of
firing
in
the
not
a
single
muscle
of
his
in
those
days
was
still
his
gleaming
eyes
were
fixed
intently
on
one
his
predictions
were
being
part
of
the
russian
force
had
already
descended
into
the
valley
toward
the
ponds
and
lakes
and
part
were
leaving
these
pratzen
heights
which
he
intended
to
attack
and
regarded
as
the
key
to
the
he
saw
over
the
mist
that
in
a
hollow
between
two
hills
near
the
village
of
the
russian
their
bayonets
were
moving
continuously
in
one
direction
toward
the
valley
and
disappearing
one
after
another
into
the
from
information
he
had
received
the
evening
from
the
sound
of
wheels
and
footsteps
heard
by
the
outposts
during
the
by
the
disorderly
movement
of
the
russian
and
from
all
he
saw
clearly
that
the
allies
believed
him
to
be
far
away
in
front
of
and
that
the
columns
moving
near
pratzen
constituted
the
center
of
the
russian
and
that
that
center
was
already
sufficiently
weakened
to
be
successfully
but
still
he
did
not
begin
the
today
was
a
great
day
for
anniversary
of
his
before
dawn
he
had
slept
for
a
few
and
and
in
good
he
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
out
into
the
field
in
that
happy
mood
in
which
everything
seems
possible
and
everything
he
sat
looking
at
the
heights
visible
above
the
and
his
cold
face
wore
that
special
look
of
happiness
that
one
sees
on
the
face
of
a
boy
happily
in
the
marshals
stood
behind
him
not
venturing
to
distract
his
he
looked
now
at
the
pratzen
now
at
the
sun
floating
up
out
of
the
when
the
sun
had
entirely
emerged
from
the
and
fields
and

were
aglow
with
dazzling

awaited

a

with
it
to

ordered
the

by

off
in
different
and
a
few
minutes
later
the
chief
forces
of
the
french
army
moved
rapidly
toward
those
pratzen
heights
which
were
being
more
and
more
denuded
by
russian
troops
moving
down
the
valley
to
their
chapter

rode
to

of

gave
them

indicating

calm
as
a

at
the
approach

was
firmly
convinced
that
this
was
the
day
of
his
or
his
bridge
of
how
it
would
come
about

did
not
but
he
felt
sure
it
would
do
the
locality

the
position
of

known
to
him
as
far
as
they
could
be

turning
to

in

it
still
lay
like
a

visible
in

our
troops
had
descended

from
whence

it
was
there
the

probably
for
something
could
be
on
the
right
the
guards
were
entering
the
misty
region
with
a
sound
of
hoofs
and
wheels
and
now
and
then
a
gleam
of
to
the
left
beyond
the
village
similar
masses
of
cavalry
came
up
and
disappeared
in
the
sea
of

behind

the

standing
at
the
end
of
the
village
letting
the
troops
pass
by
that
morning
kutuzov
seemed
worn
and
the
infantry
passing
before
him
came
to
a
halt
without
any
command
being
apparently
obstructed
by
something
in
order
them
to
form
into
battalion
columns
and
go
round
the
he
said
angrily
to
a
general
who
had
ridden
you
your
my
dear
that
you
must
not
defile
through
narrow
village
streets
when
we
are
marching
against

of
deploying

still
far
your
according
to
the
exclaimed
kutuzov
told
you
kindly
do
as
you
are
dear
nesvitski
whispered
to
prince
old
man
is
as
surly
as
a
an
austrian
officer
in
a
white
uniform
with
green
plumes
in
his
hat
galloped
up
to
kutuzov
and
asked
in
the
name
had
the
fourth
column
advanced
into
kutuzov
turned
round
without
answering
and
his
eye
happened
to
fall
upon
prince
who
was
beside
seeing
malevolent
and
caustic
expression
as
if
admitting
that
what
was
being
done
was
not
his
and
still
not
answering
the
austrian
he
addressed
my
dear
and
see
whether
the
third
division
has
passed
the

to
stop
and
await

he
stopped
ask
whether
sharpshooters
have
been
he
are
they
what
are
they
he
murmured
to
still
not
replying
to
the
prince
andrew
galloped
off
to
execute
the
overtaking
the
battalions
that
continued
to
he
stopped
the
third
division
and
convinced
himself
that
there
really
were
no
sharpshooters
in
front
of
our
the
colonel
at
the
head
of
the
regiment
was
much
surprised
at
the
order
to
throw
out
he
had
felt
perfectly
sure
that
there
were
other
troops
in
front
of
him
and
that
the
enemy
must
be
at
least
six
miles
there
was
really
nothing
to
be
seen
in
front
except
a
barren
descent
hidden
by
dense
having
given
orders
in
the
name
to
rectify
this

andrew
galloped
kutuzov
still
in
the
same
his
stout
body
resting
heavily
in
the
saddle
with
the
lassitude
of
sat
yawning
wearily
with
closed
the
troops
were
no
longer
but
stood
with
the
butts
of
their
muskets
on
the
all
he
said
to
prince
and
turned
to
a
general
watch
in
was
saying
it
was
time
they
started
as
all
the
columns
had
already
of
your
muttered
kutuzov
in
the
midst
of
a
of
he
just
then
at
a
distance
behind
kutuzov
was
heard
the
sound
of
regiments
and
this
sound
rapidly
came
nearer
along
the
whole
extended
line
of
the
advancing
russian
evidently
the
person
they
were
greeting
was
riding
when
the
soldiers
of
the
regiment
in
front
of
which
kutuzov
was
standing
began
to
he
rode
a
little
to
one
side
and
looked
round
with
a
along
the
road
from
pratzen
galloped
what
looked
like
a
squadron
of
horsemen
in
various
two
of
them
rode
side
by
side
in
at
full
one
in
a
black
uniform
with
white
plumes
in
his
hat
rode
a
bobtailed
chestnut
the
other
who
was
in
a
white
uniform
rode

these
were

two

followed
by
their
affecting
the
manners
of
an
old
soldier
at
the
gave
the
command
and
rode
up
to
the
emperors
with
a
his
whole
appearance
and
manner
were
suddenly
he
put
on
the
air
of
a
subordinate
who
obeys
without
with
an
affectation
of
respect
which
evidently
struck
alexander
he
rode
up
and
this
unpleasant
impression
merely
flitted
over
the
young
and
happy
face
of
the
emperor
like
a
cloud
of
haze
across
a
clear
sky
and
after
his
illness
he
looked
rather
thinner
that
day
than
on
the
field
of
olmutz
where
bolkonski
had
seen
him
for
the
first
time
but
there
was
still
the
same
bewitching
combination
of
majesty
and
mildness
in
his
fine
gray
and
on
his
delicate
lips
the
same
capacity
for
varying
expression
and
the
same
prevalent
appearance
of
goodhearted
innocent
at
the
olmutz
review
he
had
seemed
more
here
he
seemed
brighter
and
more
he
was
slightly
flushed
after
galloping
two
and
reining
in
his
horse
he
sighed
restfully
and
looked
round
at
the
faces
of
his
young
and
animated
as
his
prince
and
the
all
richly
dressed
gay
young
men
on
only
slightly
heated
exchanging
remarks
and
had
stopped
behind
the
the
emperor
a
long
faced
young
sat
very
erect
on
his
handsome
black
looking
about
him
in
a
leisurely
and
preoccupied
he
beckoned
to
one
of
his
white
adjutants
and
asked
some
likely
he
is
asking
at
what
they
thought
prince
watching
his
old
acquaintance
with
a
smile
he
could
not
repress
as
he
recalled
his
reception
at
in
the
suite
were
the
picked
young
orderly
officers
of
the
guard
and
line
russian
and
among
them
were
grooms
leading
the
beautiful
relay
horses
covered
with
embroidered
as
when
a
window
is
opened
a
whiff
of
fresh
air
from
the
fields
enters
a
stuffy
so
a
whiff
of
and
confidence
of
success
reached
cheerless
staff
with
the
galloping
advent
of
all
these
brilliant
young
you
michael
said
the
emperor
alexander
hurriedly
to
glancing
courteously
at
the
same
time
at
the
emperor
am
your
answered
bending
forward
the
frowning
bent
his
ear
forward
as
if
he
had
not
quite
your
repeated
andrew
noted
that
upper
lip
twitched
unnaturally
as
he
said
the
word
all
the
columns
have
formed
up
your
the
tsar
heard
but
obviously
did
not
like
the
he
shrugged
his
rather
round
shoulders
and
glanced
at
novosiltsev
who
was
near
as
if
complaining
of
michael
we
are
not
on
the
field
where
a
parade
does
not
begin
till
all
the
troops
are
said
the
tsar
with
another
glance
at
the
emperor
as
if
inviting
him
if
not
to
join
in
at
least
to
listen
to
what
he
was
but
the
emperor
francis
continued
to
look
about
him
and
did
not
is
just
why
i
do
not
said
kutuzov
in
a
resounding
apparently
to
preclude
the
possibility
of
not
being
and
again
something
in
his
face
is
just
why
i
do
not
because
we
are
not
on
parade
and
not
on
the
said
clearly
and
in
the
suite
all
exchanged
rapid
looks
that
expressed
dissatisfaction
and
though
he
may
he
should
he
certainly
should
speak
like
their
glances
seemed
to
the
tsar
looked
intently
and
observantly
into
eye
waiting
to
hear
whether
he
would
say
anything
but
with
respectfully
bowed
seemed
also
to
be
the
silence
lasted
for
about
a
if
you
command
your
said
lifting
his
head
and
again
assuming
his
former
tone
of
a
but
submissive
he
touched

stopped
at

been

two
roads

of

led
downhill

troops
were
marching
along

at

a

of
smoke
spread
all

was
heard
quite
close
at
and
a
voice
of
naive
terror
barely
two
steps
from
prince
andrew
and
at
this
as
if
at
a
everyone
began
to

toward
a
sound
of
artillery

near
having
forced
his

out
of
the

on

amid

kutuzov
despairingly
and
looked
he
his

trembling
from
a
consciousness
of
the
feebleness

pointing
to
the
disordered
battalion
and
at
the
but
before
he
had
finished
prince
feeling
tears
of
shame
and
anger
choking
had
already
leapt
from
his
horse
and
run
to
the
he
shouted
in
a
voice
piercing
as
a
it
thought
seizing
the
staff
of
the
standard
and
hearing
with
pleasure
the
whistle
of
bullets
evidently
aimed
at
several

shouted
prince
scarcely
able
to
hold
up
the
heavy
he
ran
forward
with
full
confidence
that
the
whole
battalion
would
follow
and
really
he
only
ran
a
few
steps
one
soldier
moved
and
then
another
and
soon
the
whole
battalion
ran
forward
shouting
and
overtook
a
sergeant
of
the
battalion
ran
up
and
took
the
flag
that
was
swaying
from
its
weight
in
prince

he
was
immediately
prince

again
seized
the

also
saw
french

soldiers
who
were
seizing
the
artillery
horses
and
turning
the
guns
prince
andrew
and
the
battalion
were
already
within
twenty
paces
of
the
he
heard
the
whistle
of
bullets
above
him
unceasingly
and
to
right
and
left
of
him
soldiers
continually
groaned
and
but
he
did
not
look
at
he
looked
only
at
what
was
going
on
in
front
of
the
he
now
saw
clearly
the
figure
of
a
gunner
with
his
shako
knocked
pulling
one
end
of
a
mop
while
a
french
soldier
tugged
at
the
he
could
distinctly
see
the
distraught
yet
angry
expression
on
the
faces
of
these
two
who
evidently
did
not
realize
what
they
were
are
they
thought
prince
andrew
as
he
gazed
at
the
gunner
run
away
as
he
is
why
the
frenchman
stab
he
will
not
get
away
before
the
frenchman
remembers
his
bayonet
and
stabs
and
really
another
french
trailing
his
ran
up
to
the
struggling
and
the
fate
of
the
who
had
triumphantly
secured
the
mop
and
still
did
not
realize
what
awaited
was
about
to
be
but
prince
andrew
did
not
see
how
it
it
seemed
to
him
as
though
one
of
the
soldiers
near
him
hit
him
on
the
head
with
the
full
swing
of
a
it
hurt
a
but
the
worst
of
it
was
that
the
pain
distracted
him
and
prevented
his
seeing
what
he
had
been
looking

my

opened
his

to
see
how
the

of
the
frenchmen
with
the
gunners
whether
the
gunner
had
been
killed
or
not
and
whether
the
cannon
had
been
captured
or
but
he
saw
above
him
there
was
now
nothing
but
the
lofty
not
clear
yet
still
immeasurably
with
gray
clouds
gliding
slowly
across
and
not
at
all
as
i
thought
prince
as
we
shouting
and
not
at
all
as
the
gunner
and
the
frenchman
with
frightened
and
angry
faces
struggled
for

differently

duty
rostov
had
managed
to
get
a
few
sleep
before
morning
and
felt
and
with
elasticity
of
faith
in
his
good
and
generally
in
that
state
of
mind
which
makes
everything
seem
and
all
his
wishes
were
being
fulfilled
that
there
was
to
be
a
general
engagement
in
which
he
was
taking
more
than
he
was
orderly
to
the
bravest
and
still
he
was
going
with
a
message
to
perhaps
even
to
the
sovereign
the
morning
was
he
had
a
good
horse
under
and
his
heart
was
full
of
joy
and
on
receiving
the
order
he
gave
his
horse
the
rein
and
galloped
along
the
at
first
he
rode
along
the
line
of
which
had
not
yet
advanced
into
action
but
were
standing
then
he
came
to
the
region
occupied
by
cavalry
and
here
he
noticed
a
stir
and
signs
of
preparation
for
having
passed
cavalry
he
clearly
heard
the
sound
of
cannon
and
musketry
ahead
of
the
firing
grew
louder
and
in
the
fresh
morning
air
were
now
not
two
or
three
musket
shots
at
irregular
intervals
as
followed
by
one
or
two
cannon
but
a
roll
of
volleys
of
musketry
from
the
slopes
of
the
hill
before
interrupted
by
such
frequent
reports
of
cannon
that
sometimes
several
of
them
were
not
separated
from
one
another
but
merged
into
a
general
he
could
see
puffs
of
musketry
smoke
that
seemed
to
chase
one
another
down
the
and
clouds
of
cannon
smoke
and
mingling
with
one
he
could
by
the
gleam
of
bayonets
visible
through
the
make
out
moving
masses
of
infantry
and
narrow
lines
of
artillery
with
green
rostov
stopped
his
horse
for
a
moment
on
a
hillock
to
see
what
was
going
but
strain
his
attention
as
he
would
he
could
not
understand
or
make
out
anything
of
what
was
there
in
the
smoke
men
of
some
sort
were
moving
in
front
and
behind
moved
lines
of
but
and
who
they
it
was
impossible
to
make
these
sights
and
sounds
had
no
depressing
or
intimidating
effect
on
on
the
they
stimulated
his
energy
and
go
give
it
he
mentally
exclaimed
at
these
and
again
proceeded
to
gallop
along
the
penetrating
farther
and
farther
into
the
region
where
the
army
was
already
in
it
will
be
there
i
but
all
will
be
thought
after
passing
some
austrian
troops
he
noticed
that
the
next
part
of
the
line
was
already
in
much
the
i
shall
see
it
he
he
was
riding
almost
along
the
front
a
handful
of
men
came
galloping
toward
they
were
our
uhlans
who
with
disordered
ranks
were
returning
from
the
rostov
got
out
of
their
involuntarily
noticed
that
one
of
them
was
and
galloped
is
no
business
of
he
he
had
not
ridden
many
hundred
yards
after
that
before
he
saw
to
his
across
the
whole
width
of
the
an
enormous
mass
of
cavalry
in
brilliant
white
mounted
on
black
trotting
straight
toward
him
and
across
his
rostov
put
his
horse
to
full
gallop
to
get
out
of
the
way
of
these
and
he
would
have
got
clear
had
they
continued
at
the
same
but
they
kept
increasing
their
so
that
some
of
the
horses
were
already
rostov
heard
the
thud
of
their
hoofs
and
the
jingle
of
their
weapons
and
saw
their
their
and
even
their
more
and
more
they
were
our
horse
advancing
to
attack
the
french
cavalry
that
was
coming
to
meet
the
horse
guards
were
but
still
holding
in
their
rostov
could
already
see
their
faces
and
heard
the
shouted
by
an
officer
who
was
urging
his
thoroughbred
to
full
fearing
to
be
crushed
or
swept
into
the
attack
on
the
galloped
along
the
front
as
hard
as
his
horse
could
but
still
was
not
in
time
to
avoid
the
last
of
the
horse
a
huge
pockmarked
frowned
angrily
on
seeing
rostov
before
with
whom
he
would
inevitably
this
guardsman
would
certainly
have
bowled
rostov
and
his
bedouin
over
felt
himself
quite
tiny
and
weak
compared
to
these
gigantic
men
and
had
it
not
occurred
to
rostov
to
flourish
his
whip
before
the
eyes
of
the
the
heavy
black
sixteen
hands
throwing
back
its
but
the
pockmarked
guardsman
drove
his
huge
spurs
in
and
the
flourishing
its
tail
and
extending
its
galloped
on
yet
hardly
had
the
horse
guards
passed
rostov
before
he
heard
them
and
looking
back
saw
that
their
foremost
ranks
were
mixed
up
with
some
foreign
cavalry
with
red
probably
he
could
see
nothing
for
immediately
afterwards
cannon
began
firing
from
somewhere
and
smoke
enveloped
at
that
as
the
horse
having
passed
disappeared
in
the
rostov
hesitated
whether
to
gallop
after
them
or
to
go
where
he
was
this
was
the
brilliant
charge
of
the
horse
guards
that
amazed
the
french
rostov
was
horrified
to
hear
later
that
of
all
that
mass
of
huge
and
handsome
of
all
those
rich
officers
and
who
had
galloped
past
him
on
their
only
eighteen
were
left
after
the
should
i
envy
my
chance
is
not
and
maybe
i
shall
see
the
emperor
thought
rostov
and
galloped
when
he
came
level
with
the
foot
guards
he
noticed
that
about
them
and
around
them
cannon
balls
were
of
which
he
was
aware
not
so
much
because
he
heard
their
sound
as
because
he
saw
uneasiness
on
the
faces
and
unnatural
warlike
solemnity
on
those
of
the
passing
behind
one
of
the
lines
of
a
regiment
of
foot
guards
he
heard
a
voice
calling
him
by
he
not
recognizing
been
in
the
front
our
regiment
said
boris
with
the
happy
smile
seen
on
the
faces
of
young
men
who
have
been
under
fire
for
the
first
rostov
he
how
did
it
drove
them
said
boris
with
growing
you
imagine
and
he
began
describing
how
the
having
taken
up
their
position
and
seeing
troops
before
thought
they
were
and
all
at
once
discovered
from
the
cannon
balls
discharged
by
those
troops
that
they
were
themselves
in
the
front
line
and
had
unexpectedly
to
go
into
rostov
without
hearing
boris
to
the
end
spurred
his
are
you
off
asked
a
message
to
his
he
said
thinking
rostov
had
said
and
pointing
to
the
grand
duke
who
with
his
high
shoulders
and
frowning
brows
stood
a
hundred
paces
away
from
them
in
his
helmet
and
horse
shouting
something
to
a
white
uniformed
austrian
the
grand
and
i
want
the
or
the
said
and
was
about
to
spur
his
shouted
berg
who
ran
up
from
the
other
side
as
eager
as
i
am
wounded
in
my
right
he
showed
his
bleeding
hand
with
a
handkerchief
tied
round
i
remained
at
the
i
held
my
sword
in
my
left
all
our
von
been
he
said
something
but
rostov
did
not
wait
to
hear
it
and
rode
having
passed
the
guards
and
traversed
an
empty
to
avoid
again
getting
in
front
of
the
first
line
as
he
had
done
when
the
horse
guards
followed
the
line
of
going
far
round
the
place
where
the
hottest
musket
fire
and
cannonade
were
suddenly
he
heard
musket
fire
quite
close
in
front
of
him
and
behind
our
where
he
could
never
have
expected
the
enemy
to
can
it
he
enemy
in
the
rear
of
our
and
suddenly
he
was
seized
by
a
panic
of
fear
for
himself
and
for
the
issue
of
the
whole
be
that
what
it
he
is
no
riding
round
it
i
must
look
for
the
commander
in
chief
and
if
all
is
lost
it
is
for
me
to
perish
with
the
the
foreboding
of
evil
that
had
suddenly
come
over
rostov
was
more
and
more
confirmed
the
farther
he
rode
into
the
region
behind
the
village
of
which
was
full
of
troops
of
all
does
it
what
is
whom
are
they
firing
who
is
rostov
kept
asking
as
he
came
up
to
russian
and
austrian
soldiers
running
in
confused
crowds
across
his
devil
killed
all
up
he
was
told
in
and
czech
by
the
crowd
of
fugitives
who
understood
what
was
happening
as
little
as
he
the
shouted
the
devil
take
henker
diese
muttered
a
these
several
wounded
men
passed
along
the
and
words
of
and
groans
mingled
in
a
general
then
the
firing
died
rostov
learned
later
that
russian
and
austrian
soldiers
had
been
firing
at
one
what
does
it
all
thought
where
at
any
moment
the
emperor
may
see
but
these
must
be
only
a
handful
of
it
will
soon
be
it
be
it
only
to
get
past
them
the
idea
of
defeat
and
flight
could
not
enter
though
he
saw
french
cannon
and
french
troops
on
the
pratzen
heights
just
where
he
had
been
ordered
to
look
for
the
he
could
did
not
wish
believe
chapter
xviii
rostov
had
been
ordered
to
look
for
kutuzov
and
the
emperor
near
the
village
of
but
neither
they
nor
a
single
commanding
officer
were
only
disorganized
crowds
of
troops
of
various
he
urged
on
his
already
weary
horse
to
get
quickly
past
these
but
the
farther
he
went
the
more
disorganized
they
the
highroad
on
which
he
had
come
out
was
thronged
with
carriages
of
all
and
russian
and
austrian
soldiers
of
all
some
wounded
and
some
this
whole
mass
droned
and
jostled
in
confusion
under
the
dismal
influence
of
cannon
balls
flying
from
the
french
batteries
stationed
on
the
pratzen
is
the
where
is
rostov
kept
asking
everyone
he
could
but
got
no
answer
from
at
last
seizing
a
soldier
by
his
collar
he
forced
him
to
all
bolted
long
said
the
laughing
for
some
reason
and
shaking
himself
having
left
that
soldier
who
was
evidently
rostov
stopped
the
horse
of
a
batman
or
groom
of
some
important
personage
and
began
to
question
the
man
announced
that
the
tsar
had
been
driven
in
a
carriage
at
full
speed
about
an
hour
before
along
that
very
road
and
that
he
was
dangerously
said
must
have
been
someone
saw
him
replied
the
man
with
a
smile
of
ought
to
know
the
emperor
by
after
the
times
seen
him
in
i
saw
him
just
as
i
see
there
he
sat
in
the
carriage
as
pale
as
how
they
made
the
four
black
horses
gracious
they
did
rattle
time
i
knew
the
imperial
horses
and
ilya
i
think
ilya
drives
anyone
except
the
rostov
let
go
of
the
horse
and
was
about
to
ride
when
a
wounded
officer
passing
by
addressed
is
it
you
he
he
was
killed
by
a
cannon
in
the
breast
before
our
another
officer
corrected
asked
but
his
never
there
are
not
many
left
go
that
to
that
all
the
commanders
are
said
the
pointing
to
the
village
of
and
he
walked
rostov
rode
on
at
a
footpace
not
knowing
why
or
to
whom
he
was
now
the
emperor
was
the
battle
it
was
impossible
to
doubt
it
rostov
rode
in
the
direction
pointed
out
to
in
which
he
saw
turrets
and
a
what
need
to
what
was
he
now
to
say
to
the
tsar
or
to
even
if
they
were
alive
and
this
your
that
way
you
will
be
killed
at
a
soldier
shouted
to
kill
you
what
are
you
talking
said
is
he
to
that
way
is
rostov
and
then
went
in
the
direction
where
they
said
he
would
be
all
the
same
if
the
emperor
is
am
i
to
try
to
save
he
he
rode
on
to
the
region
where
the
greatest
number
of
men
had
perished
in
fleeing
from
the
french
had
not
yet
occupied
that
and
the
uninjured
and
slightly
left
it
long
all
about
the
like
heaps
of
manure
on
lay
from
ten
to
fifteen
dead
and
wounded
to
each
couple
of
the
wounded
crept
together
in
twos
and
threes
and
one
could
hear
their
distressing
screams
and
sometimes
so
it
seemed
to
he
put
his
horse
to
a
trot
to
avoid
seeing
all
these
suffering
and
he
felt
not
for
his
but
for
the
courage
he
needed
and
which
he
knew
would
not
stand
the
sight
of
these
the
who
had
ceased
firing
at
this
field
strewn
with
dead
and
wounded
where
there
was
no
one
left
to
fire
on
seeing
an
adjutant
riding
over
it
trained
a
gun
on
him
and
fired
several
the
sensation
of
those
terrible
whistling
sounds
and
of
the
corpses
around
him
merged
in
mind
into
a
single
feeling
of
terror
and
pity
for
he
remembered
his
last
would
she
thought
she
saw
me
here
now
on
this
field
with
the
cannon
aimed
at
in
the
village
of
hosjeradek
there
were
russian
troops
retiring
from
the
field
of
who
though
still
in
some
confusion
were
less
the
french
cannon
did
not
reach
there
and
the
musketry
fire
sounded
far
here
everyone
clearly
saw
and
said
that
the
battle
was
no
one
whom
rostov
asked
could
tell
him
where
the
emperor
or
kutuzov
some
said
the
report
that
the
emperor
was
wounded
was
others
that
it
was
and
explained
the
false
rumor
that
had
spread
by
the
fact
that
the
carriage
had
really
galloped
from
the
field
of
battle
with
the
pale
and
terrified
count
who
had
ridden
out
to
the
battlefield
with
others
in
the
one
officer
told
rostov
that
he
had
seen
someone
from
headquarters
behind
the
village
to
the
and
thither
rostov
not
hoping
to
find
anyone
but
merely
to
ease
his
when
he
had
ridden
about
two
miles
and
had
passed
the
last
of
the
russian
he
near
a
kitchen
garden
with
a
ditch
round
two
men
on
horseback
facing
the
one
with
a
white
plume
in
his
hat
seemed
familiar
to
the
other
on
a
beautiful
chestnut
horse
rostov
fancied
he
had
seen
rode
up
to
the
struck
his
horse
with
his
and
giving
it
the
rein
leaped
lightly
only
a
little
earth
crumbled
from
the
bank
under
the
hind
turning
the
horse
he
again
jumped
the
and
deferentially
addressed
the
horseman
with
the
white
evidently
suggesting
that
he
should
do
the
the
whose
figure
seemed
familiar
to
rostov
and
involuntarily
riveted
his
made
a
gesture
of
refusal
with
his
head
and
hand
and
by
that
gesture
rostov
instantly
recognized
his
lamented
and
adored
it
be
alone
in
the
midst
of
this
empty
thought
at
that
moment
alexander
turned
his
head
and
rostov
saw
the
beloved
features
that
were
so
deeply
engraved
on
his
the
emperor
was
his
cheeks
sunken
and
his
eyes
but
the
the
mildness
of
his
was
all
the
rostov
was
happy
in
the
assurance
that
the
rumors
about
the
emperor
being
wounded
were
he
was
happy
to
be
seeing
he
knew
that
he
might
and
even
ought
to
go
straight
to
him
and
give
the
message
dolgorukov
had
ordered
him
to
but
as
a
youth
in
love
is
and
dares
not
utter
the
thoughts
he
has
dreamed
of
for
but
looks
around
for
help
or
a
chance
of
delay
and
flight
when
the
moment
comes
and
he
is
alone
with
so
now
that
he
had
attained
what
he
had
longed
for
more
than
anything
else
in
the
did
not
know
how
to
approach
the
and
a
thousand
reasons
occurred
to
him
why
it
would
be
and
impossible
to
do
it
is
as
if
i
were
glad
of
a
chance
to
take
advantage
of
his
being
alone
and
a
strange
face
may
seem
unpleasant
or
painful
to
him
at
this
moment
of
what
can
i
say
to
him
when
my
heart
fails
me
and
my
mouth
feels
dry
at
the
mere
sight
of
not
one
of
the
innumerable
speeches
addressed
to
the
emperor
that
he
had
composed
in
his
imagination
could
he
now
those
speeches
were
intended
for
quite
other
they
were
for
the
most
part
to
be
spoken
at
a
moment
of
victory
and
generally
when
he
was
dying
of
wounds
and
the
sovereign
had
thanked
him
for
heroic
and
while
dying
he
expressed
the
love
his
actions
had
how
can
i
ask
the
emperor
for
his
instructions
for
the
right
flank
now
that
it
is
nearly
four
and
the
battle
is
certainly
i
must
not
approach
i
must
not
intrude
on
his
better
die
a
thousand
times
than
risk
receiving
an
unkind
look
or
bad
opinion
from
rostov
and
sorrowfully
and
with
a
heart
full
despair
he
rode
continually
looking
back
at
the
who
still
remained
in
the
same
attitude
of
while
rostov
was
thus
arguing
with
himself
and
riding
sadly
captain
von
toll
chanced
to
ride
to
the
same
and
seeing
the
emperor
at
once
rode
up
to
offered
his
and
assisted
him
to
cross
the
ditch
on
the
wishing
to
rest
and
feeling
sat
down
under
an
apple
tree
and
von
toll
remained
beside
rostov
from
a
distance
saw
with
envy
and
remorse
how
von
toll
spoke
long
and
warmly
to
the
emperor
and
how
the
evidently
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hand
and
pressed
von
i
might
have
been
in
his
thought
and
hardly
restraining
his
tears
of
pity
for
the
he
rode
on
in
utter
not
knowing
where
to
or
why
he
was
now
his
despair
was
all
the
greater
from
feeling
that
his
own
weakness
was
the
cause
of
his
he
not
only
might
but
have
gone
up
to
the
it
was
a
unique
chance
to
show
his
devotion
to
the
emperor
and
he
had
not
made
use
of
have
i
thought
and
he
turned
round
and
galloped
back
to
the
place
where
he
had
seen
the
but
there
was
no
one
beyond
the
ditch
only
some
carts
and
carriages
were
passing
from
one
of
the
drivers
he
learned
that
staff
were
not
far
in
the
village
the
vehicles
were
going
rostov
followed
in
front
of
him
walked
groom
leading
horses
in
then
came
a
and
behind
that
walked
an
legged
domestic
serf
in
a
peaked
cap
and
sheepskin
i
said
the
answered
the
old
man
thresh
a
you
said
the
old
spitting
some
time
passed
in
and
then
the
same
joke
was
before
five
in
the
evening
the
battle
had
been
lost
at
all
more
than
a
hundred
cannon
were
already
in
the
hands
of
the
przebyszewski
and
his
corps
had
laid
down
their
other
columns
after
losing
half
their
men
were
retreating
in
disorderly
confused
the
remains
of
and
mingled
forces
were
crowding
around
the
dams
and
banks
of
the
ponds
near
the
village
of
after
five
it
was
only
at
the
augesd
dam
that
a
hot
cannonade
by
the
french
was
still
to
be
heard
from
numerous
batteries
ranged
on
the
slopes
of
the
pratzen
directed
at
our
retreating
in
the
dokhturov
and
others
rallying
some
battalions
kept
up
a
musketry
fire
at
the
french
cavalry
that
was
pursuing
our
it
was
growing
on
the
narrow
augesd
dam
where
for
so
many
years
the
old
miller
had
been
accustomed
to
sit
in
his
tasseled
cap
peacefully
while
his
with
shirt
sleeves
rolled
handled
the
floundering
silvery
fish
in
the
watering
on
that
dam
over
which
for
so
many
years
moravians
in
shaggy
caps
and
blue
jackets
had
peacefully
driven
their
carts
loaded
with
wheat
and
had
returned
dusty
with
flour
whitening
their
that
narrow
dam
amid
the
wagons
and
the
under
the
hoofs
and
between
the
wagon
men
disfigured
by
fear
of
death
now
crowded
crushing
one
stepping
over
the
dying
and
killing
one
only
to
move
on
a
few
steps
and
be
killed
themselves
in
the
same
every
ten
seconds
a
cannon
ball
flew
compressing
the
air
or
a
shell
burst
in
the
midst
of
that
dense
killing
some
and
splashing
with
blood
those
near
an
in
the
and
on
with
the
regimental
commander
on
horseback
and
some
ten
men
of
his
represented
all
that
was
left
of
that
whole
impelled
by
the
they
had
got
wedged
in
at
the
approach
to
the
dam
jammed
in
on
all
had
stopped
because
a
horse
in
front
had
fallen
under
a
cannon
and
the
crowd
were
dragging
it
a
cannon
ball
killed
someone
behind
another
fell
in
front
and
splashed
dolokhov
with
the
pushing
forward
squeezed
moved
a
few
and
again
on
a
hundred
yards
and
we
are
certainly
remain
here
another
two
minutes
and
it
is
certain
thought
each
dolokhov
who
was
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
forced
his
way
to
the
edge
of
the
throwing
two
soldiers
off
their
and
ran
onto
the
slippery
ice
that
covered
the
this
he
jumping
over
the
ice
which
creaked
under
this
he
shouted
to
those
with
the
the
ice
bore
him
but
it
swayed
and
and
it
was
plain
that
it
would
give
way
not
only
under
a
cannon
or
a
but
very
soon
even
under
his
weight
the
men
looked
at
him
and
pressed
to
the
hesitating
to
step
onto
the
the
general
on
horseback
at
the
entrance
to
the
dam
raised
his
hand
and
opened
his
mouth
to
address
suddenly
a
cannon
ball
hissed
so
low
above
the
crowd
that
everyone
it
flopped
into
something
and
the
general
fell
from
his
horse
in
a
pool
of
nobody
gave
him
a
look
or
thought
of
raising
onto
the
over
the
go
you
go
innumerable
voices
suddenly
shouted
after
the
ball
had
struck
the
the
men
themselves
not
knowing
or
they
were
one
of
the
hindmost
guns
that
was
going
onto
the
dam
turned
off
onto
the
crowds
of
soldiers
from
the
dam
began
running
onto
the
frozen
the
ice
gave
way
under
one
of
the
foremost
and
one
leg
slipped
into
the
he
tried
to
right
himself
but
fell
in
up
to
his
the
nearest
soldiers
shrank
the
gun
driver
stopped
his
but
from
behind
still
came
the
the
why
do
you
go
go
and
cries
of
horror
were
heard
in
the
the
soldiers
near
the
gun
waved
their
arms
and
beat
the
horses
to
make
them
turn
and
move
the
horses
moved
off
the
the
that
had
held
under
those
on
collapsed
in
a
great
and
some
forty
men
who
were
on
it
some
forward
and
some
drowning
one
still
the
cannon
balls
continued
regularly
to
whistle
and
flop
onto
the
ice
and
into
the
water
and
oftenest
of
all
among
the
crowd
that
covered
the
the
and
the
chapter
xix
on
the
pratzen
where
he
had
fallen
with
the
flagstaff
in
his
lay
prince
andrew
bolkonski
bleeding
profusely
and
unconsciously
uttering
a
and
childlike
toward
evening
he
ceased
moaning
and
became
quite
he
did
not
know
how
long
his
unconsciousness
suddenly
he
again
felt
that
he
was
alive

he
listened
and
heard
the
sound
of
approaching
and
voices
speaking
he
opened
his
above
him
again
was
the
same
lofty
sky
with
clouds
that
had
risen
and
were
floating
still
and
between
them
gleamed
blue
he
did
not
turn
his
head
and
did
not
see
those
judging
by
the
sound
of
hoofs
and
had
ridden
up
and
stopped
near
it
was
napoleon
accompanied
by
two
bonaparte
riding
over
the
battlefield
had
given
final
orders
to
strengthen
the
batteries
firing
at
the
augesd
dam
and
was
looking
at
the
killed
and
wounded
left
on
the
remarked
looking
at
a
dead
russian
with
his
face
buried
in
the
ground
and
a
blackened
lay
on
his
stomach
with
an
already
stiffened
arm
flung
ammunition
for
the
guns
in
position
is
your
said
an
adjutant
who
had
come
from
the
batteries
that
were
firing
at
some
brought
from
the
said
and
having
gone
on
a
few
steps
he
stopped
before
prince
who
lay
on
his
back
with
the
flagstaff
that
had
been
dropped
beside
flag
had
already
been
taken
by
the
french
as
a
a
fine
said
napoleon
as
he
gazed
at
prince
andrew
understood
that
this
was
said
of
him
and
that
it
was
napoleon
who
said
he
heard
the
speaker
addressed
as
but
he
heard
the
words
as
he
might
have
heard
the
buzzing
of
a
not
only
did
they
not
interest
but
he
took
no
notice
of
them
and
at
once
forgot
his
head
was
he
felt
himself
bleeding
to
and
he
saw
above
him
the
and
everlasting
he
knew
it
was
at
that
moment
napoleon
seemed
to
him
such
a
insignificant
creature
compared
with
what
was
passing
now
between
himself
and
that
lofty
infinite
sky
with
the
clouds
flying
over
at
that
moment
it
meant
nothing
to
him
who
might
be
standing
over
or
what
was
said
of
he
was
only
glad
that
people
were
standing
near
him
and
only
wished
that
they
would
help
him
and
bring
him
back
to
which
seemed
to
him
so
beautiful
now
that
he
had
today
learned
to
understand
it
so
he
collected
all
his
to
stir
and
utter
a
he
feebly
moved
his
leg
and
uttered
a
sickly
groan
which
aroused
his
own

young
man

carry
him
to
the
dressing

on
to
meet
marshal
hat
in
rode
up
smiling
to
the
emperor
to
congratulate
him
on
the
prince
andrew
remembered
nothing
he
lost
consciousness
from
the
terrible
pain
of
being
lifted
onto
the
the
jolting
while
being
and
the
probing
of
his
wound
at
the
dressing
he
did
not
regain
consciousness
till
late
in
the
when
with
other
wounded
and
captured
russian
officers
he
was
carried
to
the
during
this
transfer
he
felt
a
little
stronger
and
was
able
to
look
about
him
and
even
the
first
words
he
heard
on
coming
to
his
senses
were
those
of
a
french
convoy
who
said
must
halt
the
emperor
will
pass
here
it
will
please
him
to
see
these
gentlemen
are
so
many
prisoners
nearly
the
whole
russian
that
he
is
probably
tired
of

five
minutes
prince
andrew
had
been
able
to
say
a
few
words
to
the
soldiers
who
were
carrying
now
with
his
eyes
fixed
straight
on
he
was
so
insignificant
at
that
moment
seemed
to
him
all
the
interests
that
engrossed
so
mean
did
his
hero
himself
with
his
paltry
vanity
and
joy
in
victory
compared
to
the
and
kindly
sky
which
he
had
seen
and
that
he
could
not
answer
everything
seemed
so
futile
and
insignificant
in
comparison
with
the
stern
and
solemn
train
of
thought
that
weakness
from
loss
of
and
the
nearness
of
death
aroused
in
looking
into
eyes
prince
andrew
thought
of
the
insignificance
of
the
unimportance
of
life
which
no
one
could
and
the
still
greater
unimportance
of
the
meaning
of
which
no
one
alive
could
understand
or
the
emperor
without
waiting
for
an
answer
turned
away
and
said
to
one
of
the
officers
as
he
these
gentlemen
attended
to
and
taken
to
my
let
my
examine
their
au
prince
and
he
spurred
his
horse
and
galloped
his
face
shone
with
and
the
soldiers
who
had
carried
prince
andrew
had
noticed
and
taken
the
little
gold
icon
princess
mary
had
hung
round
her
but
seeing
the
favor
the
emperor
showed
the
they
now
hastened
to
return
the
holy
prince
andrew
did
not
see
how
and
by
whom
it
was
but
the
little
icon
with
its
thin
gold
chain
suddenly
appeared
upon
his
chest
outside
his
would
be
thought
prince
glancing
at
the
icon
his
sister
had
hung
round
his
neck
with
such
emotion
and
would
be
good
if
everything
were
as
clear
and
simple
as
it
seems
to
how
good
it
would
be
to
know
where
to
seek
for
help
in
this
and
what
to
expect
after
it
beyond
the
how
happy
and
calm
i
should
be
if
i
could
now
have
mercy
on
but
to
whom
should
i
say
either
to
a
power
which
i
not
only
cannot
address
but
which
i
cannot
even
express
in
great
all
or
said
he
to
to
that
god
who
has
been
sewn
into
this
amulet
by
there
is
nothing
nothing
at
all
except
the
unimportance
of
everything
i
and
the
greatness
of
something
incomprehensible
but
the
stretchers
moved
at
every
jolt
he
again
felt
unendurable
his
feverishness
increased
and
he
grew
visions
of
his
and
future
and
the
tenderness
he
had
felt
the
night
before
the
the
figure
of
the
insignificant
little
and
above
all
this
the
lofty
formed
the
chief
subjects
of
his
delirious
the
quiet
home
life
and
peaceful
happiness
of
bald
hills
presented
itself
to
he
was
already
enjoying
that
happiness
when
that
little
napoleon
had
suddenly
appeared
with
his
unsympathizing
look
of
shortsighted
delight
at
the
misery
of
and
doubts
and
torments
had
and
only
the
heavens
promised
toward
morning
all
these
dreams
melted
and
merged
into
the
chaos
and
darkness
of
unconciousness
and
oblivion
which
in
the
opinion
of
was
much
more
likely
to
end
in
death
than
in
is
a
bilious
said
will

were
the

old
card
tables
and
the

chandelier
with
a
cover
over

someone
had
already
seen
the
young
before
he
had
reached
the
drawing
something
flew
out
from
a
side
door
like
a
tornado
and
began
hugging
and
kissing

of
the

tight
by
the
skirt
of
his
sprang
away
and
pranced
up
and
down
in
one
place
like
a
goat
and
shrieked

around

loving
eyes
glistening
with
tears
of
and
all
around
were
lips
seeking
a
sonya

rosy

to
his
arm
radiant
with

eagerly
toward
his
waiting
for
the
look

at
this
moment
of
rapturous
she
gazed
at

smiling
and
holding
her

gave
her
a
grateful
but

still
expectant
and
looking
for
the
old
countess

not
yet
but
now
steps
were
heard
at
the
steps
so
rapid
that
they
could
hardly
be
his
yet
it
was
dressed
in
a
new
gown
which
he
did
not

since
he
had
all
the
others

him
and
he
ran
to
when
they
she
fell
on
his

could
not

her
but
only
pressed
it
to
the
cold
braiding
of

shaggy
figure

her
arms
round

escapade

everybody

shown
to
the
room
prepared
for

the
rostovs

gathered
round

in
the
sitting
the
old
not
letting
go
of
his
hand
and
kissing
it
every

beside

crowding
round
watched
every
or
look
of
never

their
blissfully
adoring
eyes
off
his
brother
and
sisters
struggled
for
the
places
nearest
to
him
and
disputed
with
one
another
who
should
bring
him
his
and
rostov
was
very
happy
in
the
love
they
showed
but
the
first
moment
of
meeting
had
been
so
beatific
that
his
present
joy
seemed
and
he
kept
expecting
something
more
and
yet
next
after
the
fatigues
of
their
the
travelers
slept
till
ten
in
the
room
next
their
bedroom
there
was
a
confusion
of
open
and
dirty

freshly
cleaned
pairs
with
spurs
had
just
been
placed
by
the
the
servants
were
bringing
in

was
a
masculine
odor
and
a
smell

his
disheveled
head
from

a
rustle
of
starched
petticoats
and
the
whispering
and
laughter
of
voices
came
from
the
adjoining
the
door
was
opened
a
crack
and
there
was
a
glimpse
of
something
of
black
and
merry
it
was
and
who
had
come
to
see
whether
they
were
getting
get
voice
was
again
heard
at
the
having
found
and
seized
the
sabers
in
the
outer
with
the
delight
boys
feel
at
the
sight
of
a
military
elder
and
forgetting
that
it
was
unbecoming
for
the
girls
to
see
men
opened
the
bedroom
this
your
he
the
girls
sprang
denisov
hid
his
hairy
legs
under
the
looking
with
a
scared
face
at
his
comrade
for
the
having
let
petya
closed
a
sound
of
laughter
came
from
behind
come
out
in
your
dressing
said
this
your
asked

addressing
the
denisov
with
servile

hurriedly
put
something
on

drew
on
his
dressing
and

put
on
one
spurred
boot
and
was
just
getting
her
foot
into

twirling
round
and

about
to
expand
her
dresses
into
a
balloon
and
sit

were
dressed
in
new
and
were
both
and
sonya
ran
but
taking
her
led
him
into
the
sitting
where
they
began
they
hardly
gave
one
another
time
to
ask
questions
and
give
replies
concerning
a
thousand
little
matters
which
could
not
interest
anyone
but
natasha
laughed
at
every
word
he
said
or
that
she
said
not
because
what
they
were
saying
was
but
because
she
felt
happy
and
was
unable
to
control
her
joy
which
expressed
itself
by
how
how
she
said
to
rostov
felt
under
the
influence
of
the
warm
rays
of
that
childlike
smile
which
had
not
once
appeared
on
his
face
since
he
left
home

the
first
time

eighteen
months

burned
my
arm
for
her
look
she
pulled
up
her
muslin
sleeve
and
showed
him
a
red
scar
on
her
delicate
high
above
the
elbow
on
that
part
that
is
covered
even
by
a
ball
burned
this
to
prove
my
love
for
i
just
heated
a
ruler
in
the
fire
and
pressed
it
sitting
on
the
sofa
with
the
little
cushions
on
its
in
what
used
to
be
his
old
and
looking
into
wildly
bright
rostov
that
world
of
home
and
childhood
which
had
no
meaning
for
anyone
but
gave
him
some
of
the
best
joys
of
his
and
the
burning
of
an
arm
with
a
ruler
as
a
proof
of
love
did
not
seem
to
him
he
understood
and
was
not
surprised
at
and
is
that
he
are
such
such
all
that
ruler
business
was
just
but
we
are
friends
if
she
loves
does
it
for
but
i
understand
i
forget
what
she
loves
me
and
you
like
natasha
suddenly
you
remember
before
you
went
she
says
you
are
to
forget
all
she
shall
love
him
but
let
him
be
that
lovely
and
very
asked
so
seriously
and
excitedly
that
it
was
evident
that
what
she
was
now
saying
she
had
talked
of
with
rostov
became
never
go
back
on
my
he
sonya
is
so
charming
that
only
a
fool
would
renounce
such
cried
and
i
have
already
talked
it
we
knew
say
but
it
because
you
if
you
say
you
consider
yourself
bound
by
your
will
seem
as
if
she
had
not
meant
it
it
makes
it
as
if
you
were
marrying
her
because
you
and
that
do
at
rostov
saw
that
it
had
been
well
considered
by
sonya
had
already
struck
him
by
her
beauty
on
the
preceding
when
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
she
seemed
still
more
she
was
a
charming
girl
of
evidently
passionately
in
love
with
him
did
not
doubt
that
for
an
why
should
he
not
love
her
and
even
marry
rostov
but
just
now
there
were
so
many
other
pleasures
and
interests
before
they
have
taken
a
wise
he
must
remain
said
talk
it
over
later
how
glad
i
am
to
have
and
are
you
still
true
to
he
what
cried
think
about
him
or
anyone
and
i
want
anything
of
the
then
what
are
you
up
to
repeated
and
a
happy
smile
lit
up
her
you
seen
seen
famous
well
you
what
up
curving
her
natasha
held
out
her
skirts
as
dancers
ran
back
a
few
cut
a
brought
her
little
feet
sharply
and
made
some
steps
on
the
very
tips
of
her
she
but
could
not
maintain
herself
on
her
toes
any
what
up
never
marry
but
will
be
a
only
tell
rostov
laughed
so
loud
and
merrily
that
in
his
felt
envious
and
natasha
could
not
help
joining
but
you
think
she
kept
and
so
you
no
longer
wish
to
marry
natasha
flared
want
to
marry
and
tell
him
so
when
i
see
said
all
natasha
chattered
is
denisov
she
well
go
and
is
he
very
asked
vaska
is
a
splendid
call
him
and
is
he
very
be
all
have
breakfast
and
natasha
rose
and
went
out
of
the
room
on
like
a
ballet
but
smiling
as
only
happy
girls
of
fifteen
can
when
rostov
met
sonya
in
the
drawing
he
he
did
not
know
how
to
behave
with
the
evening
in
the
first
happy
moment
of
they
had
kissed
each
but
today
they
felt
it
could
not
be
he
felt
that
including
his
mother
and
was
looking
inquiringly
at
him
and
watching
to
see
how
he
would
behave
with
he
kissed
her
hand
and
addressed
her
not
as
thou
but
as
but
their
eyes
met
and
said
and
exchanged
tender
her
looks
asked
him
to
forgive
her
for
having
by
to
remind
him
of
his
and
then
thanked
him
for
his
his
looks
thanked
her
for
offering
him
his
freedom
and
told
her
that
one
way
or
another
he
would
never
cease
to
love
for
that
would
be
strange
it
said
selecting
a
moment
when
all
were
sonya
and
nicholas
now
say
you
to
one
another
and
meet
like
remark
was
as
her
remarks
always
like
most
of
her
it
made
everyone
feel
not
only
and
but
even
the
old
this
love
affair
which
might
hinder
nicholas
from
making
a
brilliant
blushed
like
a
to
appeared
in
the
drawing
room
with
pomaded
and
in
a
new
looking
just
as
smart
as
he
made
himself
when
going
into
and
he
was
more
amiable
to
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
than
rostov
had
ever
expected
to
see
chapter
ii
on
his
return
to
moscow
from
the
nicholas
rostov
was
welcomed
by
his
home
circle
as
the
best
of
a
and
their
darling
by
his
relations
as
a
and
polite
young
by
his
acquaintances
as
a
handsome
lieutenant
of
a
good
and
one
of
the
best
matches
in
the
the
rostovs
knew
everybody
in
the
old
count
had
money
enough
that
as
all
his
estates
had
been
and
so
acquiring
a
trotter
of
his
very
stylish
riding
breeches
of
the
latest
such
as
no
one
else
yet
had
in
and
boots
of
the
latest
with
extremely
pointed
toes
and
small
silver
passed
his
time
very
after
a
short
period
of
adapting
himself
to
the
old
conditions
of
nicholas
found
it
very
pleasant
to
be
at
home
he
felt
that
he
had
grown
up
and
matured
very
his
despair
at
failing
in
a
scripture
his
borrowing
money
from
gavril
to
pay
a
sleigh
his
kissing
sonya
on
the
now
recalled
all
this
as
childishness
he
had
left
immeasurably
now
he
was
a
lieutenant
of
in
a
jacket
laced
with
and
wearing
the
cross
of
awarded
to
soldiers
for
bravery
in
and
in
the
company
of
and
respected
racing
men
was
training
a
trotter
of
his
own
for
a
he
knew
a
lady
on
one
of
the
boulevards
whom
he
visited
of
an
he
led
the
mazurka
at
the
talked
about
the
war
with
field
marshal
visited
the
english
and
was
on
intimate
terms
with
a
colonel
of
forty
to
whom
denisov
had
introduced
his
passion
for
the
emperor
had
cooled
somewhat
in
but
as
he
did
not
see
him
and
had
no
opportunity
of
seeing
he
often
spoke
about
him
and
about
his
love
for
letting
it
be
understood
that
he
had
not
told
all
and
that
there
was
something
in
his
feelings
for
the
emperor
not
everyone
could
and
with
his
whole
soul
he
shared
the
adoration
then
common
in
moscow
for
the
who
was
spoken
of
as
the
during
short
stay
in
before
rejoining
the
he
did
not
draw
closer
to
but
rather
drifted
away
from
she
was
very
pretty
and
and
evidently
deeply
in
love
with
but
he
was
at
the
period
of
youth
when
there
seems
so
much
to
do
that
there
is
no
time
for
that
sort
of
thing
and
a
young
man
fears
to
bind
himself
and
prizes
his
freedom
which
he
needs
for
so
many
other
when
he
thought
of
during
this
stay
in
he
said
to
there
will
and
there
many
more
such
girls
somewhere
whom
i
do
not
yet
there
will
be
time
enough
to
think
about
love
when
i
want
but
now
i
have
no
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
society
of
women
was
rather
derogatory
to
his
he
went
to
balls
and
into
society
with
an
affectation
of
doing
so
against
his
the
the
english
sprees
with
and
visits
to
a
certain
was
another
matter
and
quite
the
thing
for
a
dashing
young
at
the
beginning
of
old

ilya
rostov
was
very
busy
arranging
a
dinner
in

of

few
men

so
well
how
to
arrange
a
feast
on
an
hospitable
and
still
fewer
men
would
be
so
well
able
and
willing
to
make
up
out
of
their
own
resources
what
might
be
needed
for
the
success
of
the
the
club
cook
and
the
steward
listened
to
the
orders
with
pleased
for
they
knew
that
under
no
other
management
could
they
so
easily
extract
a
good
profit
for
themselves
from
a
dinner
costing
several

remembering
something

returned

back
the
cook

the

and
again
began
giving
a
light
footstep
and
the
clinking
of

his

a
half
smile
betraying
her
sympathy

called

pierre
is
quite
broken
by
his
but
still
tell
him
to
come
to
the
will
all
blow
it
will
be
a
tremendous
next
the
third
of
soon
after
one
two
hundred
and
fifty
members
of
the
english
club
and
fifty
guests
were
awaiting
the
guest
of
honor
and
hero
of
the
austrian
prince
to
on
the
first
arrival
of
the
news
of
the
battle
of
moscow
had
been
at
that
the
russians
were
so
used
to
victories
that
on
receiving
news
of
the
defeat
some
would
simply
not
believe
while
others
sought
some
extraordinary
explanation
of
so
strange
an
in
the
english
where
all
who
were
and
well
informed
foregathered
when
the
news
began
to
arrive
in
nothing
was
said
about
the
war
and
the
last
as
though
all
were
in
a
conspiracy
of
the
men
who
set
the
tone
in
prince
yuri
count
and
prince
not
show
themselves
at
the
but
met
in
private
houses
in
intimate
and
the
moscovites
who
took
their
opinions
from
rostov
among
for
a
while
without
any
definite
opinion
on
the
subject
of
the
war
and
without
the
moscovites
felt
that
something
was
wrong
and
that
to
discuss
the
bad
news
was
and
so
it
was
best
to
be
but
after
a
just
as
a
jury
comes
out
of
its
the
bigwigs
who
guided
the
opinion
and
everybody
began
speaking
clearly
and
reasons
were
found
for
the
and
impossible
event
of
a
russian
everything
became
and
in
all
corners
of
moscow
the
same
things
began
to
be
these
reasons
were
the
treachery
of
the
a
defective
the
treachery
of
the
pole
przebyszewski
and
of
the
frenchman
and
was
the
youth
and
inexperience
of
the
who
had
trusted
worthless
and
insignificant
but
the
the
russian
everyone
was
extraordinary
and
had
achieved
miracles
of
the
and
generals
were
but
the
hero
of
heroes
was
prince
distinguished
by
his
schon
grabern
affair
and
by
the
retreat
from
where
he
alone
had
withdrawn
his
column
unbroken
and
had
all
day
beaten
back
an
enemy
force
twice
as
numerous
as
his
what
also
conduced
to
being
selected
as
hero
was
the
fact
that
he
had
no
connections
in
the
city
and
was
a
stranger
in
his
honor
was
shown
to
a
simple
fighting
russian
soldier
without
connections
and
and
to
one
who
was
associated
by
memories
of
the
italian
campaign
with
the
name
of
paying
such
honor
to
bagration
was
the
best
way
of
expressing
disapproval
and
dislike
of
there
been
no
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
invent
said
the
wit
parodying
the
words
of
kutuzov
no
one
spoke
except
some
who
abused
him
in
calling
him
a
court
weathercock
and
an
old
all
moscow
repeated
prince
you
go
on
modeling
and
modeling
you
must
get
smeared
with
suggesting
consolation
for
our
defeat
by
the
memory
of
former
and
the
words
of
that
french
soldiers
have
to
be
incited
to
battle
by
highfalutin
and
germans
by
logical
arguments
to
show
them
that
it
is
more
dangerous
to
run
away
than
to
but
that
russian
soldiers
only
need
to
be
restrained
and
held
on
all
new
and
fresh
anecdotes
were
heard
of
individual
examples
of
heroism
shown
by
our
officers
and
men
at
one
had
saved
a
another
had
killed
five
a
third
had
loaded
five
cannon
berg
was
by
those
who
did
not
know
as
when
wounded
in
the
right
taken
his
sword
in
the
and
gone
of
nothing
was
and
only
those
who
knew
him
intimately
regretted
that
he
had
died
so
leaving
a
pregnant
wife
with
his
eccentric
chapter
iii
on
that
third
of
all
the
rooms
in
the
english
club
were
filled
with
a
hum
of
like
the
hum
of
bees
swarming
in
the
members
and
guests
of
the
club
wandered
hither
and
and
some
in
uniform
and
some
in
evening
and
a
few
here
and
there
with
powdered
hair
and
in
russian
powdered
in

at

anxiously
noting
every

to
offer
their
most
of
those

were
respected
men
with
fat
and
resolute
gestures

this
class
of
guests

sat
in
certain

met
in

habitual
a
minority
of
those

again

in

the
faces
of
these
young
especially
those
who
were
military
bore
that
expression
of
condescending
respect
for
their
elders
which

prepared
to
respect
and
honor
but
all
the

abandoned

about
the
rooms
fashionably
dressed
but
looking
sad
and
as
he
was
surrounded
by
an
atmosphere
of
subservience
to
his
and
being
in
the
habit
of
lording
it
over
these
he
treated
them
with
by
his
age
he
should
have
belonged
to
the
younger
but
by
his
wealth
and
connections
he
belonged
to
the
groups
of
old
and
honored
and
so
he
went
from
one
group
to
some
of
the
most
important
old

the

of
groups
which
even
strangers
approached
respectfully

hear
the
voices
of

largest
circles

rostopchin
was
describing
how

been
overwhelmed
by

and
had
had
to

their
way
through
them

that

been

to
ascertain

speaking
of
the
meeting
of
the
austrian
council
of

at
which
suvorov
crowed
like
a
cock
in
reply
to
the
nonsense
talked
by
the
austrian
standing
close
tried
to
make
a
saying
that
kutuzov
had
evidently
failed
to
learn
from
suvorov
even
so
simple
a
thing
as
the
art
of
crowing
like

the
elder

glanced
severely
at
the

on
that
it
was
improper
to

of

and
went
about
in
his
soft
boots
between
the
dining
and
drawing
hastily
greeting
the
important
and
all
of
whom
he
as
if
they
were
all
while
his
eyes
occasionally
sought
out
his
fine
young
resting
on
him
and
winking
joyfully
at
young

stood
at
a
window
with
whose
acquaintance
he

lately
made

in

large
drawing
room
by
the
door
of

in
the
doorway
of
the
anteroom
without
hat
or
in
accord
with
the
club
he
had
given
up
to
the
hall
he
had
no
lambskin
cap
on
his
nor
had
he
a
loaded
whip
over
his

when
rostov
had
seen
him
on
the
eve
of
the
battle
of

wore
a
tight
new
uniform
with
russian
and
foreign

the
star
of

just
before
coming
to
the
dinner
he
had
had
his

his
appearance
for

was
something
naively
festive

and
virile

a
rather
comical

at

doorway
to
allow

the
guest
of
to
enter
bagration
was
not
wishing
to
avail
himself
of
their

this
caused
some
delay
at
the
but
after
all
he
did
at
last
enter
he
walked
shyly
and
awkwardly
over
the
parquet
floor
of
the
reception
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
his
he
was
more
accustomed
to
walk
over
a
plowed
field
under
as
he
had
done
at
the
head
of
the
kursk
regiment
at
schon
he
would
have
found
that
the
committeemen
met
him
at
the
first
door
expressing
their
delight
at
seeing
such
a
highly
honored
took
possession
of
him
as
it
without
waiting
for
his
surrounded

led
him
to
the
drawing
it
was
at
first
impossible
to
enter
the
door
for
the
crowd
of
members
and
guests
jostling
one
another
and
trying
to
get
a
good
look
at
bagration
over
each
as
if
he
were
some
rare
count

laughing
and
repeating
the
dear

pushed
through
the
crowd
more
energetically
than
led
the

into

way
through

out
of

and
reappeared
a
minute
later
with
another
carrying
a
large
silver
salver

he
presented
to
prince

the
salver
lay
some
verses

and
printed

seeing

around

as
though
seeking
but
all
eyes
demanded
that
he
should

himself
in

resolutely
took
the
salver
with
both
hands
and
looked
sternly
and
reproachfully
at
the
count
who
had
presented
it
to
someone
obligingly
took
the
dish
from

seemed
to
fixing
his
weary
eyes
on

to

them
with
a
fixed
and
serious
but
the
author
himself
took
the

and
began
reading

but
before
he
had
finished
a
stentorian
announced
that
dinner
was

and
from
the
dining
room
came
the
resounding
strains
of
the
joyful
thunder
valiant
and
count
glancing
angrily
at
the
author
who
went
on
reading
his
bowed
to
everyone
feeling
that
dinner
was
more
important
than
and
again
preceding
all
the
went
in
to
he
was
seated
in
the
place
of
honor
between
two
and
was
a
significant
allusion
to
the
name
of
the
three
hundred
persons
took
their
seats
in
the
dining
according
to
their
rank
and
the
more
important
nearer
to
the
honored
as
naturally
as
water
flows
deepest
where
the
land
lies
just
before
count
ilya
rostov
presented
his
son
to
who
recognized
him
and
said
a
few
words
to
disjointed
and
as
were
all
the
words
he
spoke
that
and
count
ilya
looked
joyfully
and
proudly
around
while
bagration
spoke
to
his
nicholas
with
denisov
and
his
new
sat
almost
at
the
middle
of
the
facing
them
sat
beside
prince
count
ilya
rostov
with
the
other
members
of
the
committee
sat
facing
bagration
as
the
very
personification
of
moscow
did
the
honors
to
the
his
efforts
had
not
been
in
the
both
the
lenten
and
the
other
was
yet
he
could
not
feel
quite
at
ease
till
the
end
of
the
he
winked
at
the
whispered
directions
to
the
and
awaited
each
expected
dish
with
some
everything
was
with
the
second
a
gigantic
sterlet
sight
of
which
ilya
rostov
blushed
with
the
footmen
began
popping
corks
and
filling
the
champagne
after
the
which
made
a
certain
the
count
exchanged
glances
with
the
other
will
be
many
time
to
he
and
taking
up
his
he
all
were
waiting
for
what
he
would
the
health
of
our
the
he
and
at
the
same
moment
his
kindly
eyes
grew
moist
with
tears
of
joy
and
the
band
immediately
struck
up
joyful
thunder
all
rose
and
cried
bagration
also
rose
and
shouted
in
exactly
the
same
voice
in
which
he
had
shouted
it
on
the
field
at
schon
young
ecstatic
voice
could
be
heard
above
the
three
hundred
he
nearly
the
health
of
our
the
he
and
emptying
his
glass
at
one
gulp
he
dashed
it
to
the
many
followed
his
and
the
loud
shouting
continued
for
a
long
when
the
voices
the
footmen
cleared
away
the
broken
glass
and
everybody
sat
down
smiling
at
the
noise
they
had
made
and
exchanging
the
old
count
rose
once
glanced
at
a
note
lying
beside
his
and
proposed
a
the
health
of
the
hero
of
our
last
prince
peter
ivanovich
and
again
his
blue
eyes
grew
cried
the
three
hundred
voices
but
instead
of
the
band
a
choir
began
singing
a
cantata
composed
by
paul
ivanovich
all
barriers
courage
conquest
have
we
not
he
brings
foe
men
to
their
as
soon
as
the
singing
was
another
and
another
toast
was
proposed
and
count
ilya
rostov
became
more
and
more
more
glass
was
and
the
shouting
grew
they
drank
to
to
the
to
all
the
club
members
and
to
all
the
club
and
finally
to
count
ilya
rostov
as
the
organizer
of
the
at
that
the
count
took
out
his
handkerchief
covering
his
wept
chapter
iv
pierre
sat
opposite
dolokhov
and
nicholas
as
he
ate
and
drank
and
but
those
who
knew
him
intimately
noticed
that
some
great
change
had
come
over
him
that
he
was
silent
all
through
dinner
and
looked
blinking
and
with
fixed
eyes
and
a
look
of
complete
kept
rubbing
the
bridge
of
his
his
face
was
depressed
and
he
seemed
to
see
and
hear
nothing
of
what
was
going
on
around
him
and
to
be
absorbed
by
some
depressing
and
unsolved
the
unsolved
problem
that
tormented
him
was
caused
by
hints
given
by
the
his
at
concerning
intimacy
with
his
and
by
an
anonymous
letter
he
had
received
that
which
in
the
mean
jocular
way
common
to
anonymous
letters
said
that
he
saw
badly
through
his
but
that
his
connection
with
dolokhov
was
a
secret
to
no
one
but
pierre
absolutely
disbelieved
both
the
hints
and
the
but
he
feared
now
to
look
at
who
was
sitting
opposite
every
time
he
chanced
to
meet
handsome
insolent
pierre
felt
something
terrible
and
monstrous
rising
in
his
soul
and
turned
quickly
involuntarily
recalling
his
past
and
her
relations
with
pierre
saw
clearly
that
what
was
said
in
the
letter
might
be
or
might
at
least
seem
to
be
true
had
it
not
referred
to
his
he
involuntarily
remembered
how
who
had
fully
recovered
his
former
position
after
the
had
returned
to
petersburg
and
come
to
availing
himself
of
his
friendly
relations
with
pierre
as
a
boon
dolokhov
had
come
straight
to
his
and
pierre
had
put
him
up
and
lent
him
pierre
recalled
how
helene
had
smilingly
expressed
disapproval
of
living
at
their
and
how
cynically
dolokhov
had
praised
his
beauty
to
him
and
from
that
time
till
they
came
to
moscow
had
not
left
them
for
a
he
is
very
thought
i
know
it
would
be
particularly
pleasant
to
him
to
dishonor
my
name
and
ridicule
just
because
i
have
exerted
myself
on
his
befriended
and
helped
i
know
and
understand
what
a
spice
that
would
add
to
the
pleasure
of
deceiving
if
it
really
were
if
it
were
but
i
do
not
believe
i
have
no
right
and
believe
he
remembered
the
expression
face
assumed
in
his
moments
of
as
when
tying
the
policeman
to
the
bear
and
dropping
them
into
the
or
when
he
challenged
a
man
to
a
duel
without
any
or
shot
a
horse
with
a
that
expression
was
often
on
face
when
looking
at
he
is
a
thought
kill
a
man
means
nothing
to
it
must
seem
to
him
that
everyone
is
afraid
of
and
that
must
please
he
must
think
that
am
afraid
of
in
fact
i
am
afraid
of
he
and
again
he
felt
something
terrible
and
monstrous
rising
in
his
and
rostov
were
now
sitting
opposite
pierre
and
seemed
very
rostov
was
talking
merrily
to
his
two
one
of
whom
was
a
dashing
hussar
and
the
other
a
notorious
duelist
and
and
every
now
and
then
he
glanced
ironically
at
whose
and
massive
figure
was
a
very
noticeable
one
at
the
rostov
looked
inimically
at
first
because
pierre
appeared
to
his
hussar
eyes
as
a
rich
the
husband
of
a
and
in
a
old
and
secondly
because
pierre
in
his
preoccupation
and
had
not
recognized
rostov
and
had
not
responded
to
his
when
the
health
was
lost
in
did
not
rise
or
lift
his
are
you
shouted
looking
at
him
in
an
ecstasy
of
you
hear
his
majesty
the
pierre
rose
emptied
his
waiting
till
all
were
seated
turned
with
his
kindly
smile
to
i
recognize
he
but
rostov
was
otherwise
he
was
shouting
you
renew
the
said
dolokhov
to
a
said
should
make
up
to
the
husbands
of
pretty
said
pierre
did
not
catch
what
they
were
but
knew
they
were
talking
about
he
reddened
and
turned
now
to
the
health
of
handsome
said
and
with
a
serious
but
with
a
smile
lurking
at
the
corners
of
his
he
turned
with
his
glass
to
to
the
health
of
lovely
their
he
with
downcast
drank
out
of
his
glass
without
looking
at
dolokhov
or
answering
the
who
was
distributing
leaflets
with
laid
one
before
pierre
as
one
of
the
principal
he
was
just
going
to
take
it
when
leaning
snatched
it
from
his
hand
and
began
reading
pierre
looked
at
dolokhov
and
his
eyes
the
something
terrible
and
monstrous
that
had
tormented
him
all
dinnertime
rose
and
took
possession
of
he
leaned
his
whole
massive
body
across
the
dare
you
take
he
hearing
that
cry
and
seeing
to
whom
it
was
nesvitski
and
the
neighbor
on
his
right
quickly
turned
in
alarm
to
what
are
you
whispered
their
frightened
dolokhov
looked
at
pierre
with
cruel
and
that
smile
of
his
which
seemed
to
this
is
what
i
have
he
said
with
quivering
pierre
snatched
the
i
challenge
he
pushing
back
his
he
rose
from
the
at
the
very
instant
he
did
this
and
uttered
those
pierre
felt
that
the
question
of
his
guilt
which
had
been
tormenting
him
the
whole
day
was
finally
and
indubitably
answered
in
the
he
hated
her
and
was
forever
sundered
from
despite
request
that
he
would
take
no
part
in
the
rostov
agreed
to
be
and
after
dinner
he
discussed
the
arrangements
for
the
duel
with
pierre
went
but
rostov
with
dolokhov
and
denisov
stayed
on
at
the
club
till
listening
to
the
gypsies
and
other
till
tomorrow
at
said
as
he
took
leave
of
rostov
in
the
club
do
you
feel
quite
rostov
dolokhov
you
tell
you
the
whole
secret
of
dueling
in
two
if
you
are
going
to
fight
a
and
you
make
a
will
and
write
affectionate
letters
to
your
and
if
you
think
you
may
be
you
are
a
fool
and
are
lost
for
but
go
with
the
firm
intention
of
killing
your
man
as
quickly
and
surely
as
and
then
all
will
be
as
our
bear
huntsman
at
kostroma
used
to
tell
fears
a
he
when
you
see
one
your
all
and
your
only
thought
is
not
to
let
him
get
and
how
it
is
with
a
mon
till
my
dear
next
at
eight
in
the
pierre
and
nesvitski
drove
to
the
sokolniki
forest
and
found
and
rostov
already
pierre
had
the
air
of
a
man
preoccupied
with
considerations
which
had
no
connection
with
the
matter
in
his
haggard
face
was
he
had
evidently
not
slept
that
he
looked
about
distractedly
and
screwed
up
his
eyes
as
if
dazzled
by
the
he
was
entirely
absorbed
by
two
his
of
which
after
his
sleepless
night
he
had
not
the
slightest
and
the
guiltlessness
of
who
had
no
reason
to
preserve
the
honor
of
a
man
who
was
nothing
to
should
perhaps
have
done
the
same
thing
in
his
thought
even
certain
that
i
should
have
done
the
then
why
this
this
either
i
shall
kill
or
he
will
hit
me
in
the
or
or

from

clearing
in
the
pine

covered
with
melting

forty

were
stuck
into

ten
paces
apart
to

the
it
was

at

nothing

stepped

along

at

went
quickly
missing

and
stepping
into

he
held
the
pistol
in
his
right
hand
at
apparently
afraid
of
shooting
himself
with
his
left
hand
he
held
carefully
because
he
wished
to
support
his
right
hand
with
it
and
knew
he
must
not
do
having
advanced
six
paces
and
strayed
off
the
track
into
the

looked
down
at

then
quickly
glanced
at
dolokhov
bending
his
finger
as

quivered
but
his
still
glittered
with
effort
and

as

mustered

raised

and
cover
yourself
with

denisov
cried
to
his
with
a
gentle
smile
of
pity
and
his
arms
and
legs
helplessly
spread
stood
with
his
broad
chest
directly
facing
dolokhov
looked
sorrowfully
at

nesvitski
closed
their
at
the
same
instant
they
heard
a
report
and
angry
shouted
and
he
lay
face
downwards
on

and
turning
round
went
into
the

through

deep
and
muttering

puckering
his
nesvitski
stopped
him
and
took

rostov
and
denisov
drove
away
with
the
wounded
the
latter
lay
silent
in
the
sleigh
with
closed
eyes
and
did
not
answer
a
word
to
the
questions
addressed
to
but
on
entering
moscow
he
suddenly
came
to
lifting
his
head
with
an
took
who
was
sitting
beside
by
the
rostov
was
struck
by
the
totally
altered
and
unexpectedly
rapturous
and
tender
expression
on
how
do
you

but
not

dolokhov
with
a
gasping
are

i
but
i
have
killed
she
get
over
she
asked
my
my
my
adored
angel
and
dolokhov
pressed
hand
and
burst
into
when
he
had
become
a
little
he
explained
to
rostov
that
he
was
living
with
his
if
she
saw
him
would
not
survive
he
implored
rostov
to
go
on
and
prepare
rostov
went
on
ahead
to
do
what
was
and
to
his
great
surprise
learned
that
dolokhov
the
dolokhov
the
lived
in
moscow
with
an
old
mother
and
a
hunchback
and
was
the
most
affectionate
of
sons
and
chapter
vi
pierre
had
of
late
rarely
seen
his
wife
both
in
petersburg
and
in
moscow
their
house
was
always
full
of
the
night
after
the
duel
he
did
not
go
to
his
bedroom
as
he
often
remained
in
his
that
huge
room
in
which
count
bezukhov
had
he
lay
down
on
the
sofa
meaning
to
fall
asleep
and
forget
all
that
had
happened
to
but
could
not
do
such
a
storm
of
and
memories
suddenly
arose
within
him
that
he
could
not
fall
nor
even
remain
in
one
but
had
to
jump
up
and
pace
the
room
with
rapid
now
he
seemed
to
see
her
in
the
early
days
of
their
with
bare
shoulders
and
a
passionate
look
on
her
and
then
immediately
he
saw
beside
her
and
mocking
face
as
he
had
seen
it
at
the
and
then
that
same
face
and
as
it
had
been
when
he
reeled
and
sank
on
the
has
he
asked
have
killed
her
killed
my
that
was
and
how
did
i
come
to
do
you
married
answered
an
inner
in
what
was
i
to
he
marrying
her
without
loving
in
deceiving
yourself
and
and
he
vividly
recalled
that
moment
after
supper
at
prince
when
he
spoke
those
words
he
had
found
so
difficult
to
love
all
comes
from
even
then
i
felt
he
felt
then
that
it
was
not
that
i
had
no
right
to
do
and
so
it
turns
he
remembered
his
honeymoon
and
blushed
at
the
particularly
and
shameful
was
the
recollection
of
how
one
day
soon
after
his
marriage
he
came
out
of
the
bedroom
into
his
study
a
little
before
noon
in
his
silk
dressing
gown
and
found
his
head
steward
bowing
looked
into
his
face
and
at
his
dressing
gown
and
smiled
as
if
expressing
respectful
understanding
of
his
how
often
i
have
felt
proud
of
proud
of
her
majestic
beauty
and
social
thought
proud
of
my
in
which
she
received
all
proud
of
her
unapproachability
and
so
this
is
what
i
was
proud
i
then
thought
that
i
did
not
understand
how
often
when
considering
her
character
i
have
told
myself
that
i
was
to
blame
for
not
understanding
for
not
understanding
that
constant
composure
and
complacency
and
lack
of
all
interests
or
and
the
whole
secret
lies
in
the
terrible
truth
that
she
is
a
depraved
now
i
have
spoken
that
terrible
word
to
myself
all
has
become
used
to
come
to
borrow
money
from
her
and
used
to
kiss
her
naked
she
did
not
give
him
the
but
let
herself
be
her
father
in
jest
tried
to
rouse
her
and
she
replied
with
a
calm
smile
that
she
was
not
so
stupid
as
to
be
him
do
what
he
she
used
to
say
of
one
day
i
asked
her
if
she
felt
any
symptoms
of
she
laughed
contemptuously
and
said
she
was
not
a
fool
to
want
to
have
and
that
she
was
not
going
to
have
any
children
by
then
he
recalled
the
coarseness
and
bluntness
of
her
thoughts
and
the
vulgarity
of
the
expressions
that
were
natural
to
though
she
had
been
brought
up
in
the
most
aristocratic
not
such
a
just
you
try
it
she
used
to
often
seeing
the
success
she
had
with
young
and
old
men
and
women
pierre
could
not
understand
why
he
did
not
love
clear
out
of
i
never
loved
said
he
to
knew
she
was
a
depraved
he
dared
not
admit
it
to
and
now
dolokhov
sitting
in
the
snow
with
a
forced
smile
and
perhaps
while
meeting
my
remorse
with
some
forced
pierre
was
one
of
those
people
in
spite
of
an
appearance
of
what
is
called
weak
do
not
seek
a
confidant
in
their
he
digested
his
sufferings
is
all
her
he
said
to
what
of
why
did
i
bind
myself
to
why
did
i
say
vous
to
which
was
a
and
worse
than
a
i
am
guilty
and
must
a
slur
on
my
a
misfortune
for
he
slur
on
my
name
and
all
apart
from
i
love
xvi
was
executed
because
they
said
he
was
dishonorable
and
a
came
into
from
their
point
of
view
they
were
as
were
those
too
who
canonized
him
and
died
a
death
for
his
then
robespierre
was
beheaded
for
being
a
who
is
right
and
who
is
no
but
if
you
are
tomorrow
die
as
i
might
have
died
an
hour
and
is
it
worth
tormenting
when
one
has
only
a
moment
of
life
in
comparison
with
but
at
the
moment
when
he
imagined
himself
calmed
by
such
she
suddenly
came
into
his
mind
as
she
was
at
the
moments
when
he
had
most
strongly
expressed
his
insincere
love
for
and
he
felt
the
blood
rush
to
his
heart
and
had
again
to
get
up
and
move
about
and
break
and
tear
whatever
came
to
his
did
i
tell
her
that
vous
he
kept
repeating
to
and
when
he
had
said
it
for
the
tenth
que
diable
faire
dans
cette
occurred
to
and
he
began
to
laugh
at
what
the
devil
was
he
doing
in
that
in
the
night
he
called
his
valet
and
told
him
to
pack
up
to
go
to
he
could
not
imagine
how
he
could
speak
to
her
he
resolved
to
go
away
next
day
and
leave
a
letter
informing
her
of
his
intention
to
part
from
her
next
morning
when
the
valet
came
into
the
room
with
his
pierre
was
lying
asleep
on
the
ottoman
with
an
open
book
in
his
he
woke
up
and
looked
round
for
a
while
with
a
startled
unable
to
realize
where
he
countess
told
me
to
inquire
whether
your
excellency
was
at
said
the
but
before
pierre
could
decide
what
answer
he
would
the
countess
herself
in
a
white
satin
dressing
gown
embroidered
with
silver
and
with
simply
dressed
hair
immense
plaits
twice
round
her
lovely
head
like
a
entered
the
calm
and
except
that
there
was
a
wrathful
wrinkle
on
her
rather
prominent
marble
with
her
imperturbable
calm
she
did
not
begin
to
speak
in
front
of
the
she
knew
of
the
duel
and
had
come
to
speak
about
she
waited
till
the
valet
had
set
down
the
coffee
things
and
left
the
pierre
looked
at
her
timidly
over
his
and
like
a
hare
surrounded
by
hounds
who
lays
back
her
ears
and
continues
to
crouch
motionless
before
her
he
tried
to
continue
but
feeling
this
to
be
senseless
and
he
again
glanced
timidly
at
she
did
not
sit
down
but
looked
at
him
with
a
contemptuous
waiting
for
the
valet

this
what
have
you
been
up
to
i
should
like

opened

her
voice
and
became
more
and
more

better
man
than

in
every
growled
frowning
without
looking
at

not
moving

how

tell

plainly
that

said
pierre
wished
to
say
looked
at
her
with
eyes
whose
strange
expression
she
did
not
and
lay
down
he
was
suffering
physically
at
that
there
was
a
weight
on
his
chest
and
he
could
not
he
knew
that
he
must
do
something
to
put
an
end
to
this
but
what
he
wanted
to
do
was
too
had
better
he
muttered
in
a
broken
very
but
only
if
you
give
me
a
said
a
thing
to
frighten
me
pierre
leaped
up
from
the
sofa
and
rushed
staggering
toward

he
and
seizing
the
marble
top
of
a
table
with
a
strength
he
had
never
before
he
made
a
step
toward
her
brandishing
the
face

she
shrieked
and
sprang
his
nature
showed
itself
in
he
felt
the
fascination
and
delight
of
he
flung
down
the
broke
and
swooping
down
on
her
with
outstretched
hands
in
such
a
terrible
voice
that
the
whole
house
heard
it
with
god
knows
what
he
would
have
done
at
that
moment
had
helene
not
fled
from

chapter
vii
two
months
had
elapsed
since
the
news
of
the
battle
of
austerlitz
and
the
loss
of
prince
andrew
had
reached
bald
and
in
spite
of
the
letters
sent
through
the
embassy
and
all
the
searches
his
body
had
not
been
found
nor
was
he
on
the
list
of
what
was
worst
of
all
for
his
relations
was
the
fact
that
there
was
still
a
possibility
of
his
having
been
picked
up
on
the
battlefield
by
the
people
of
the
place
and
that
he
might
now
be
recovering
or
alone
among
strangers
and
unable
to
send
news
of
the
gazettes
from
which
the
old
prince
first
heard
of
the
defeat
at
austerlitz
as
usual
very
briefly
and
that
after
brilliant
engagements
the
russians
had
had
to
retreat
and
had
made
their
withdrawal
in
perfect
the
old
prince
understood
from
this
official
report
that
our
army
had
been
a
week
after
the
gazette
report
of
the
battle
of
austerlitz
came
a
letter
from
kutuzov
informing
the
prince
of
the
fate
that
had
befallen
his
wrote
before
my
a
standard
in
his
hand
and
at
the
head
of
a
fell
as
a
worthy
of
his
father
and
his
to
the
great
regret
of
myself
and
of
the
whole
army
it
is
still
uncertain
whether
he
is
alive
or
i
comfort
myself
and
you
with
the
hope
that
your
son
is
for
otherwise
he
would
have
been
mentioned
among
the
officers
found
on
the
field
of
a
list
of
whom
has
been
sent
me
under
flag
of
after
receiving
this
news
late
in
the
when
he
was
alone
in
his
the
old
prince
went
for
his
walk
as
usual
next
but
he
was
silent
with
his
the
and
the
and
though
he
looked
very
grim
he
said
nothing
to
when
princess
mary
went
to
him
at
the
usual
hour
he
was
working
at
his
lathe
as
did
not
look
round
at
princess
he
said
suddenly
in
an
unnatural
throwing
down
his
wheel
continued
to
revolve
by
its
own
and
princess
mary
long
remembered
the
dying
creak
of
that
which
merged
in
her
memory
with
what
she
approached
saw
his
and
something
gave
way
within
her
eyes
grew
by
the
expression
of
her
not
not
but
angry
and
working
she
saw
that
hanging
over
her
and
about
to
crush
her
was
some
terrible
the
worst
in
one
she
had
not
yet
irreparable
and
death
of
one
she
the
awkward
princess
with
such
an
indescribable
charm
of
sorrow
and
that
her
father
could
not
bear
her
look
but
turned
away
with
a
not
among
the
prisoners
nor
among
the
kutuzov
and
he
screamed
as
piercingly
as
if
he
wished
to
drive
the
princess
away
by
that
the
princess
did
not
fall
down
or
she
was
already
but
on
hearing
these
words
her
face
changed
and
something
brightened
in
her
radiant
it
was
as
if
supreme
joy
apart
from
the
joys
and
sorrows
of
this
the
great
grief
within
she
forgot
all
fear
of
her

up
to

his
and
drawing
him
down

her
arm
round
his
scraggy

the
old
turning
his
face
away
from
the
destroying
the
and
go
and
tell
the
princess
sank
helplessly
into
an
armchair
beside
her
father
and
she
saw
her
brother
now
as
he
had
been
at
the
moment
when
he
took
leave
of
her
and
of
his
look
tender
yet
she
saw
him
tender
and
amused
as
he
was
when
he
put
on
the
little
he
had

repented
of
his

he
now
there
in
the

when
princess
mary
returned
from
her
the
little
princess
sat
working
and
looked
up
with
that
curious
expression
of
happy
calm
peculiar
to
pregnant
it
was
evident
that
her
eyes
did
not
see
princess
mary
but
were
looking
into
at
something
joyful
and
mysterious
taking
place
within
she
moving
away
from
the
embroidery
frame
and
lying
me
your
she
took
her
hand
and
held
it

down
before

in
the
folds
of
her

am
going
to

and
happy
eyes

her
she
was

the
only

sad
about

wiping
away
her
tears
on
her
several
times
in
the
course
of
the
morning
princess
mary
began
trying
to
prepare
her
and
every
time
began
to
unobservant
as
was
the
little
these
the
cause
of
which
she
did
not
agitated
she
said
nothing
but
looked
about
uneasily
as
if
in
search
of
before
dinner
the
old
of
whom
she
was
always
came
into
her
room
with
a
peculiarly
restless
and
malign
expression
and
went
out
again
without
saying
a
she
looked
at
princess
then
sat
thinking
for
a
while
with
that
expression
of
attention
to
something
within
her
that
is
only
seen
in
pregnant
and
suddenly
began
to
anything

looking
firmly
with
her
radiant
eyes
at

had
determined
not
to

and
persuaded
her
father
to
hide
the
terrible
news
from
her
till
after
her
which
was
expected
within
a
few
princess
mary
and
the
old
prince

bore
and

their
grief
in
their
own

old
prince

not
cherish
any
he
made
up
his
mind
that
prince
andrew
had
been
and
though
he
sent
an
official
to
austria
to
seek
for
traces
of

he
ordered
a
monument
from
moscow
which
he
intended
to
erect
in
his
own
garden
to
his
and
he
told
everybody
that
his
son

princess

prayed
for
her

the
little
princess
after
breakfast
on
the
morning
of
the
nineteenth
and
her
downy
little
lip
rose
from
old
but
as
sorrow
was
manifest
in
every
the
sound
of
every
and
even
every
footstep
in
that
house
since
the
terrible
news
had
so
now
the
smile
of
the
little
by
the
general
mood
though
without
knowing
its
such
as
to

and
was
about
to
leave

besides
the
pallor
and
the
physical
suffering
on
the
little
an
expression
of
childish
fear
of
inevitable
pain
showed
only
say

and
the
little
princess
began
to
cry
capriciously
like
a
suffering
child
and
to
wring
her
little
hands

with
some
princess

out
of
the
room
to

five
minutes
later
princess
mary
from
her
room
heard
something
heavy
being
carried
she
looked
the
men
servants
were
carrying
the
large
leather
sofa
from
prince
study
into
the
on
their
faces
was
a
quiet
and
solemn
princess
mary
sat
alone
in
her
room
listening
to
the
sounds
in
the
now
and
then
opening
her
door
when
someone
passed
and
watching
what
was
going
on
in
the
some
women
passing
with
quiet
steps
in
and
out
of
the
bedroom
glanced
at
the
princess
and
turned
she
did
not
venture
to
ask
any
and
shut
the
door
now
sitting
down
in
her
easy
now
taking
her
prayer
now
kneeling
before
the
icon
to
her
surprise
and
distress
she
found
that
her
prayers
did
not
calm
her
suddenly
her
door
opened
softly
and
her
old
praskovya
who
hardly
ever
came
to
that
room
as
the
old
prince
had
forbidden
appeared
on
the
threshold
with
a
shawl
round
her

the
gilt
candles
before
the
icons
and
sat
down
by
the
door
with
her
princess
mary
took
a
book
and
began
only
when
footsteps
or
voices
were
heard
did
they
look
at
one
the
princess
anxious
and
the
nurse
everyone
in
the
house
was
dominated
by
the
same
feeling
that
princess
mary
experienced
as
she
sat
in
her
but
owing
to
the
superstition
that
the
fewer
the
people
who
know
of
it
the
less
a
woman
in
travail
everyone
tried
to
pretend
not
to
no
one
spoke
of
but
apart
from
the
ordinary
staid
and
respectful
good
manners
habitual
in
the
a
common
a
softening
of
the
and
a
consciousness
that
something
great
and
mysterious
was
being
accomplished
at
that
moment
made
itself
there
was
no
laughter
in
the
large
in
the
men
hall
all
sat
silently
and
in
the
outlying
quarters
torches
and
candles
were
burning
and
no
one
the
old
stepping
on
his
paced
up
and
down
his
study
and
sent
tikhon
to
ask
mary
bogdanovna
what
only
that
prince
told
me
to
and

tikhon
did
not
hear
the
slightest
sound
from
the

a
while

it
as
if

the

lying
on

his
perturbed
shook
his
and
going
up
to
him
silently
kissed
him
on
the
shoulder
and
left
the
room
without
snuffing
the
candles
or
saying
why
he
had
the
most
solemn
mystery
in
the
world
continued
its
evening
night
and
the
feeling
of
suspense
and
softening
of
heart
in
the
presence
of
the
unfathomable
did
not
lessen
but
no
one
it
was
one
of
those
march
nights
when
winter

to

its
sway
and
scatters

and
storms

standing
close
to
the
door
and
as
soon
as
it
opened
his
rough
old
arms
closed
like
a
vise
round
his
and
without
a
word
he
began
to
sob
like
a
three
days
later
the
little
princess
was
and
prince
andrew
went
up
the
steps
to
where
the
coffin
to
give
her
the
farewell
and
there
in
the
coffin
was
the
same
though
with
closed
what
have
you
done
to
it
still
seemed
to
and
prince
andrew
felt
that
something
gave
way
in
his
soul
and
that
he
was
guilty
of
a
sin
he
could
neither
remedy
nor
he
could
not
the
old
man
too
came
up
and
kissed
the
waxen
little
hands
that
lay
quietly
crossed
one
on
the
other
on
her
and
to
her
face
seemed
to
what
have
you
done
to
and
and
at
the
sight
the
old
man
turned
angrily
another
five
days
and
then
the
young
prince
nicholas
andreevich
was
the
wet
nurse
supported
the
coverlet
with
her
while
the
priest
with
a
goose
feather
anointed
the
little
red
and
wrinkled
soles
and
his
who
was
his
trembling
and
afraid
of
dropping
carried
the
infant
round
the
battered
tin
font
and
handed
him
over
to
the
princess
prince
andrew
sat
in
another
faint
with
fear
lest
the
baby
should
be
drowned
in
the
and
awaited
the
termination
of
the
he
looked
up
joyfully
at
the
baby
when
the
nurse
brought
it
to
him
and
nodded
approval
when
she
told
him
that
the
wax
with
the
hair
had
not
sunk
in
the
font
but
had
chapter
x
share
in
duel
with
bezukhov
was
hushed
up
by
the
efforts
of
the
old
and
instead
of
being
degraded
to
the
ranks
as
he
expected
he
was
appointed
an
adjutant
to
the
governor
general
of
as
a
result
he
could
not
go
to
the
country
with
the
rest
of
the
but
was
kept
all
summer
in
moscow
by
his
new
dolokhov
and
rostov
became
very
friendly
with
him
during
his
dolokhov
lay
ill
at
his
who
loved
him
passionately
and
and
old
mary
who
had
grown
fond
of
rostov
for
his
friendship
to
her
often
talked
to
him
about
her
she
would
is
too
noble
and
for
our
depraved
no
one
now
loves
it
seems
like
a
reproach
to
now
tell
was
it
was
it
of
and
with
his
noble
loved
him
and
even
now
never
says
a
word
against
those
pranks
in
petersburg
when
they
played
some
tricks
on
a
they
do
it
and
bezukhov
got
off
while
fedya
had
to
bear
the
whole
burden
on
his
fancy
what
he
had
to
go
true
he
has
been
but
how
could
they
fail
to
do
i
think
there
were
not
many
such
gallant
sons
of
the
fatherland
out
there
as
and
have
these
people
no
or
knowing
him
to
be
an
only
to
challenge
him
and
shoot
so
well
god
had
mercy
on
and
what
was
it
who
have
intrigues
if
he
was
so
as
i
see
things
he
should
have
shown
it
but
he
lets
it
go
on
for
and
then
to
call
him
reckoning
on
fedya
not
fighting
because
he
owed
him
what
what
i
know
you
understand
my
dear
believe
is
why
i
am
so
fond
of
few
people
do
understand
he
is
such
a
heavenly
dolokhov
himself
during
his
convalescence
spoke
to
rostov
in
a
way
no
one
would
have
expected
of
know
people
consider
me
a
bad
he
i
care
a
straw
about
anyone
but
those
i
but
those
i
i
love
so
that
i
would
give
my
life
for
and
the
others
throttle
if
they
stood
in
my
i
have
an
a
priceless
and
two
or
three
among
as
for
the
rest
i
only
care
about
them
in
so
far
as
they
are
harmful
or
and
most
of
them
are
especially
the
dear
he
have
met
but
i
have
not
yet
met
any
or
were
not
i
have
not
yet
met
that
divine
purity
and
devotion
i
look
for
in
if
i
found
such
a
one
give
my
life
for
but
and
he
made
a
gesture
of
believe
if
i
still
value
my
life
it
is
only
because
i
still
hope
to
meet
such
a
divine
who
will
and
elevate
but
you
understand
i
quite
answered
who
was
under
his
new
in
the
autumn
the
rostovs
returned
to
early
in
the
winter
denisov
also
came
back
and
stayed
with
the
first
half
of
the
winter
of
which
nicholas
rostov
spent
in
was
one
of
the
merriest
times
for
him
and
the
whole
nicholas
brought
many
young
men
to
his
vera
was
a
handsome
girl
of
sonya
a
girl
of
sixteen
with
all
the
charm
of
an
opening
half
grown
up
and
half
was
now
childishly
now
girlishly
at
that
time
in
the
house
there
prevailed
an
amorous
atmosphere
characteristic
of
homes
where
there
are
very
young
and
very
charming
every
young
man
who
came
to
the
those
smiling
young
faces
probably
at
their
own
feeling
the
eager
bustle
around
and
hearing
the
fitful
bursts
of
song
and
music
and
the
inconsequent
but
friendly
prattle
of
young
girls
ready
for
anything
and
full
of
the
same
sharing
with
the
young
folk
of
the
household
a
readiness
to
fall
in
love
and
an
expectation
of
among
the
young
men
introduced
by
rostov
one
of
the
first
was
whom
everyone
in
the
house
liked
except
she
almost
quarreled
with
her
brother
about
she
insisted
that
he
was
a
bad
and
that
in
the
duel
with
pierre
was
right
and
dolokhov
and
further
that
he
was
disagreeable
and
nothing
for
me
to
she
cried
out
with
resolute
is
wicked
and
there
i
like
your
denisov
though
he
is
a
rake
and
all
still
i
like
so
you
see
i
do
i
know
how
to
put
with
this
one
everything
is
and
i
like
but
denisov
is
quite
replied
implying
that
even
denisov
was
nothing
compared
to
must
understand
what
a
soul
there
is
in
you
should
see
him
with
his
what
a
i
know
about
but
i
am
uncomfortable
with
and
do
you
know
he
has
fallen
in
love
with
certain
of
prediction
proved
who
did
not
usually
care
for
the
society
of
began
to
come
often
to
the
and
the
question
for
whose
sake
he
came
no
one
spoke
of
was
soon
he
came
because
of
and
though
she
would
never
have
dared
to
say
knew
it
and
blushed
scarlet
every
time
dolokhov
dolokhov
often
dined
at
the
never
missed
a
performance
at
which
they
were
and
went
to
balls
for
young
people
which
the
rostovs
always
he
was
pointedly
attentive
to
sonya
and
looked
at
her
in
such
a
way
that
not
only
could
she
not
bear
his
glances
without
but
even
the
old
countess
and
natasha
blushed
when
they
saw
his
it
was
evident
that
this
strong
man
was
under
the
irresistible
influence
of
the
graceful
girl
who
loved
rostov
noticed
something
new
in
relations
with
but
he
did
not
explain
to
himself
what
these
new
relations
always
in
love
with
he
thought
of
sonya
and
but
he
was
not
as
much
at
ease
with
sonya
and
dolokhov
as
before
and
was
less
frequently
at
in
the
autumn
of
1806
everybody
had
again
begun
talking
of
the
war
with
napoleon
with
even
greater
warmth
than
the
year
orders
were
given
to
raise
ten
men
in
every
thousand
for
the
regular
and
besides
nine
men
in
every
thousand
for
the
everywhere
bonaparte
was
anathematized
and
in
moscow
nothing
but
the
coming
war
was
talked
for
the
rostov
family
the
whole
interest
of
these
preparations
for
war
lay
in
the
fact
that
nicholas
would
not
hear
of
remaining
in
and
only
awaited
the
termination
of
furlough
after
christmas
to
return
with
him
to
their
his
approaching
departure
did
not
prevent
his
amusing
but
rather
gave
zest
to
his
he
spent
the
greater
part
of
his
time
away
from
at
and
chapter
xi
on
the
third
day
after
christmas
nicholas
dined
at
a
thing
he
had
rarely
done
of
it
was
a
grand
farewell
as
he
and
denisov
were
leaving
to
join
their
regiment
after
about
twenty
people
were
including
dolokhov
and
never
had
love
been
so
much
in
the
and
never
had
the
amorous
atmosphere
made
itself
so
strongly
felt
in
the
house
as
at
this
holiday
the
moments
of
love
and
be
that
is
the
only
reality
in
the
all
else
is
it
is
the
one
thing
we
are
interested
in
said
the
spirit
of
the
having
as
usual
exhausted
two
pairs
of
without
visiting
all
the
places
he
meant
to
go
to
and
where
he
had
been
returned
home
just
before
as
soon
as
he
entered
he
noticed
and
felt
the
tension
of
the
amorous
air
in
the
and
also
noticed
a
curious
embarrassment
among
some
of
those
and
the
old
countess
were
especially
and
to
a
lesser
degree
nicholas
understood
that
something
must
have
happened
between
sonya
and
dolokhov
before
and
with
the
kindly
sensitiveness
natural
to
him
was
very
gentle
and
wary
with
them
both
at
on
that
same
evening
there
was
to
be
one
of
the
balls
that
iogel
dancing
gave
for
his
pupils
during
the
will
you
come
to
please
said
asked
and
vasili
dmitrich
is
also
would
i
not
go
at
the
said
who
at
the
had
jocularly
assumed
the
role
of
even
weady
to
dance
the
pas
de
i
have
answered
i
promised
the
they
have
a
he
asked
but
as
soon
as
he
had
asked
the
question
he
noticed
that
it
should
not
have
been
coldly
and
angrily
replied
glancing
at
he
gave
nicholas
just
such
a
look
as
he
had
given
pierre
at
the
club
is
something
thought
and
he
was
further
confirmed
in
this
conclusion
by
the
fact
that
dolokhov
left
immediately
after
he
called
natasha
and
asked
her
what
was
the
i
was
looking
for
said
natasha
running
out
to
told
but
you
would
not
believe
she
said
has
proposed
to
little
as
nicholas
had
occupied
himself
with
sonya
of
something
seemed
to
give
way
within
him
at
this
dolokhov
was
a
suitable
and
in
some
respects
a
brilliant
match
for
the
orphan
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
old
countess
and
of
society
it
was
out
of
the
question
for
her
to
refuse
and
therefore
first
feeling
on
hearing
the
news
was
one
of
anger
with
he
tried
to
of
course
forget
her
childish
promises
and
accept
the
but
before
he
had
time
to
say
it
natasha
began
she
refused
him
quite
after
a
told
him
she
loved
my
sonya
could
not
have
done
thought
as
mamma
pressed
she
and
i
know
she
change
once
she
has
mamma
pressed
said
nicholas
said
you
be
i
know
you
will
not
marry
i
heaven
knows
but
i
know
for
certain
that
you
marry
you
know
that
at
said
i
must
talk
to
what
a
darling
sonya
he
added
with
a
she
is
indeed
a
send
her
to
and
natasha
kissed
her
brother
and
ran
a
minute
later
sonya
came
in
with
a
and
scared
nicholas
went
up
to
her
and
kissed
her
this
was
the
first
time
since
his
return
that
they
had
talked
alone
and
about
their
he
timidly
at
first
and
then
more
and
more
you
wish
to
refuse
one
who
is
not
only
a
brilliant
and
advantageous
match
but
a
noble
he
is
my
sonya
interrupted
have
already
she
said
you
are
refusing
for
my
i
am
afraid
that
sonya
again
she
gave
him
an
frightened
tell
me
she
but
i
it
may
be
arrogant
of
but
still
it
is
best
to
say
if
you
refuse
him
on
my
i
must
tell
you
the
whole
i
love
and
i
think
i
love

more
than

enough
for

but
i
have
been
in
love
a
thousand
times
and
shall
fall
in

though
for
no
one

such
a
feeling
of
and
love
as
i
have
for

i
am
mamma
does
not
wish

to
consider

articulating

as
a
brother
and
always
and
i
want

i
am
afraid

nicholas
again
kissed

chapter
xii
were
the
most
enjoyable
balls
in
so
said
the
mothers
as
they
watched
their
young
people
executing
their
newly
learned
and
so
said
the
youths
and
maidens
themselves
as
they
danced
till
they
were
ready
to
and
so
said
the
young
men
and
women
who
came
to
these
balls
with
an
air
of
condescension
and
found
them
most
that
year
two
marriages
had
come
of
these
the
two
pretty
young
princesses
gorchakov
met
suitors
there
and
were
married
and
so
further
increased
the
fame
of
these
what
distinguished
them
from
others
was
the
absence
of
host
or
hostess
and
the
presence
of
the
flying
about
like
a
feather
and
bowing
according
to
the
rules
of
his
as
he
collected
the
tickets
from
all
his
there
was
the
fact
that
only
those
came
who
wished
to
dance
and
amuse
themselves
as
girls
of
thirteen
and
fourteen
do
who
are
wearing
long
dresses
for
the
first
with
scarcely
any
exceptions
they
all
or
seemed
to
rapturous
were
their
smiles
and
so
sparkling
their
sometimes
the
best
of
the
of
whom
who
was
exceptionally
was
even
danced
the
pas
de
but
at
this
last
ball
only
the
the
and
the
which
was
just
coming
into
were
iogel
had
taken
a
ballroom
in
and
the
as
everyone
was
a
great
there
were
many
pretty
girls
and
the
rostov
girls
were
among
the
they
were
both
particularly
happy
and
that
proud
of
her
and
her
explanation
with
sonya
twirled
about
before
she
left
home
so
that
the
maid
could
hardly
get
her
hair
and
she
was
transparently
radiant
with
impulsive
natasha
no
less
proud
of
her
first
long
dress
and
of
being
at
a
real
ball
was
even
they
were
both
dressed
in
white
muslin
with
pink
natasha
fell
in
love
the
very
moment
she
entered
the
she
was
not
in
love
with
anyone
in
but
with
whatever
person
she
happened
to
look
at
she
was
in
love
with
for
that
how
delightful
it
she
kept
running
up
to
nicholas
and
denisov
were
walking
up
and
looking
with
kindly
patronage

sweet

not

off

beat
time
with
his

in
a
way

clearly
indicated
that

not

was
because
he
would

in

not

and
he
looked
the
fine
fellow
he
felt
himself
to
at
the
right
beat
of
the
music
he
looked
sideways
at
his
partner
with
a
merry
and
triumphant
suddenly
stamped
with
one

from

floor
like
a

flew
round
the
room
taking
his
partner
with

glided
silently
on
one
foot
half
across
the
and
seeming
not
to
notice

dashing
straight
at

abandoning

to

followed
his
lead
hardly
knowing
first
he
spun
her
holding
her
now
with
his
now
with
his
right
then
falling
on
one
knee
he
twirled
her
round
and
again
jumping
dashed
so
impetuously
forward
that
it
seemed
as
if
he
would
rush
through
the
whole
suite
of
rooms
without
drawing
and
then
he
suddenly
stopped
and
performed
some
new
and
unexpected
when
at
smartly
whirling
his
partner
round
in
front
of
her
he
drew
up
with
a
click
of
his
spurs
and
bowed
to
natasha

not

make
him
a

fixed
her
eyes
on
him
in
smiling
as
if
she
did
not

this
she
brought

iogel
did
not
acknowledge
this
to
be
the
real
everyone
was
delighted
with

was
asked
again
and
again
as
a
and
the
old
men
began
smilingly
to
talk
about
poland

the
good
old
flushed
after
the
mazurka
and
mopping
himself
with
his
sat
down
by
natasha
and
did
not
leave
her
for
the
rest
of
the
chapter
xiii
for
two
days
after
that
rostov
did
not
see
dolokhov
at
his
own
or
at
on
the
third
day
he
received
a
note
from
as
i
do
not
intend
to
be
at
your
house
again
for
reasons
you
know
and
am
going
to
rejoin
my
i
am
giving
a
farewell
supper
tonight
to
my

the
english
about
ten
rostov
went
to
the
english
hotel
straight
from
the
where
he
had
been
with
his
family
and
he
was
at
once
shown
to
the
best
which
dolokhov
had
taken
for
that
some
twenty
men
were
gathered
round
a
table
at
which
dolokhov
sat
between
two
on
the
table
was
a
pile
of
gold
and
paper
and
he
was
keeping
the
rostov
had
not
seen
him
since
his
proposal
and
refusal
and
felt
uncomfortable
at
the
thought
of
how
they
would
cold
glance
met
rostov
as
soon
as
he
entered
the
as
though
he
had
long
expected
a
long
time
since
we
he
for
just
finish
and
then
ilyushka
will
come
with
his
called
once
or
twice
at
your
said
dolokhov
made
no
may
he
rostov
recalled
at
that
moment
a
strange
conversation
he
had
once
had
with
but
fools
trust
to
luck
in
dolokhov
had
then
are
you
afraid
to
play
with
dolokhov
now
asked
as
if
guessing
beneath
his
smile
rostov
saw
in
him
the
mood
he
had
shown
at
the
club
dinner
and
at
other
when
as
if
tired
of
everyday
life
he
had
felt
a
need
to
escape
from
it
by
some
and
usually
rostov
felt
ill
at
he
but
to
find
some
joke
with
which
to
reply
to
but
before
he
had
thought
of
looking
straight
in
his
said
slowly
and
deliberately
so
that
everyone
could
you
remember
we
had
a
talk
about
a
fool
who
trusts
to
one
should
make
and
i
want
to
try
his
luck
or
the
rostov
asked
better
not
dolokhov
and
springing
a
new
pack
of
cards
moving
the
money
forward
he
prepared
to
rostov
sat
down
by
his
side
and
at
first
did
not
dolokhov
kept
glancing
at
you
he
and
strange
to
say
nicholas
felt
that
he
could
not
help
taking
up
a
putting
a
small
stake
on
and
beginning
to
have
no
money
with
he
trust
rostov
staked
five
rubles
on
a
card
and
staked
and
again
dolokhov
that
ten
cards
of
said
dolokhov
after
he
had
dealt
for
some
place
your
money
on
the
cards
or
i
may
get
muddled
in
the
one
of
the
players
said
he
hoped
he
might
be
you
but
i
am
afraid
of
getting
the
accounts
so
i
ask
you
to
put
the
money
on
your
replied
stint
settle
he
turning
to
the
game
a
waiter
kept
handing
round
all
cards
were
beaten
and
he
had
eight
hundred
rubles
scored
up
against
he
wrote
on
a
but
while
the
waiter
filled
his
glass
he
changed
his
mind
and
altered
it
to
his
usual
stake
of
twenty
said
though
he
did
not
seem
to
be
even
looking
at
win
it
back
all
the
i
lose
to
the
others
but
win
from
or
are
you
afraid
of
he
asked
rostov
he
let
the
eight
hundred
remain
and
laid
down
a
seven
of
hearts
with
a
torn
which
he
had
picked
up
from
the
he
well
remembered
that
seven
he
laid
down
the
seven
of
on
which
with
a
broken
bit
of
chalk
he
had
written
in
clear
upright
he
emptied
the
glass
of
warm
champagne
that
was
handed
smiled
at
and
with
a
sinking
waiting
for
a
seven
to
turn
gazed
at
hands
which
held
the
much
depended
on
winning
or
losing
on
that
seven
of
on
the
previous
sunday
the
old
count
had
given
his
son
two
thousand
and
though
he
always
disliked
speaking
of
money
difficulties
had
told
nicholas
that
this
was
all
he
could
let
him
have
till
and
asked
him
to
be
more
economical
this
nicholas
had
replied
that
it
would
be
more
than
enough
for
him
and
that
he
gave
his
word
of
honor
not
to
take
anything
more
till
the
now
only
twelve
hundred
rubles
was
left
of
that
so
that
this
seven
of
hearts
meant
for
him
not
only
the
loss
of
sixteen
hundred
but
the
necessity
of
going
back
on
his
with
a
sinking
heart
he
watched
hands
and
make
haste
and
let
me
have
this
card
and
take
my
cap
and
drive
home
to
supper
with
and
and
will
certainly
never
touch
a
card
at
that
moment
his
home
jokes
with
talks
with
duets
with
piquet
with
his
and
even
his
comfortable
bed
in
the
house
on
the
povarskaya
rose
before
him
with
such
and
charm
that
it
seemed
as
if
it
were
all
a
lost
and
unappreciated
long
he
could
not
conceive
that
a
stupid
letting
the
seven
be
dealt
to
the
right
rather
than
to
the
might
deprive
him
of
all
this
newly
appreciated
and
newly
and
plunge
him
into
the
depths
of
unknown
and
undefined
that
could
not
yet
he
awaited
with
a
sinking
heart
the
movement
of
those
reddish
with
hairy
wrists
visible
from
under
the
shirt
laid
down
the
pack
and
took
up
a
glass
and
a
pipe
that
were
handed
you
are
not
afraid
to
play
with
repeated
and
as
if
about
to
tell
a
good
story
he
put
down
the
leaned
back
in
his
and
began
deliberately
with
a
been
told
a
rumor
going
about
moscow
that
a
so
i
advise
you
to
be
exclaimed
those
moscow
said
and
he
took
up
the
cards
with
a
rostov
almost
screamed
lifting
both
hands
to
his
the
seven
he
needed
was
lying
the
first
card
in
the
he
had
lost
more
than
he
could
ruin
said
dolokhov
with
a
side
glance
at
rostov
as
he
continued
to
chapter
xiv
an
hour
and
a
half
later
most
of
the
players
were
but
little
interested
in
their
own
the
whole
interest
was
concentrated
on
instead
of
sixteen
hundred
rubles
he
had
a
long
column
of
figures
scored
against
which
he
had
reckoned
up
to
ten
but
that
as
he
vaguely
must
have
risen
to
fifteen
in
reality
it
already
exceeded
twenty
thousand
dolokhov
was
no
longer
listening
to
stories
or
telling
but
followed
every
movement
of
hands
and
occasionally
ran
his
eyes
over
the
score
against
he
had
decided
to
play
until
that
score
reached
he
had
fixed
on
that
number
because
was
the
sum
of
his
and
joint
leaning
his
head
on
both
sat
at
the
table
which
was
scrawled
over
with
wet
with
spilled
and
littered
with
one
tormenting
impression
did
not
leave
that
those
boned
reddish
hands
with
hairy
wrists
visible
from
under
the
shirt
those
hands
which
he
loved
and
held
him
in
their
hundred
a
a
winning
it
how
pleasant
it
was
at
the
double
or
it
and
why
is
he
doing
this
to
rostov
sometimes
he
staked
a
large
but
dolokhov
refused
to
accept
it
and
fixed
the
stake
nicholas
submitted
to
and
at
one
moment
prayed
to
god
as
he
had
done
on
the
battlefield
at
the
bridge
over
the
and
then
guessed
that
the
card
that
came
first
to
hand
from
the
crumpled
heap
under
the
table
would
save
now
counted
the
cords
on
his
coat
and
took
a
card
with
that
number
and
tried
staking
the
total
of
his
losses
on
then
he
looked
round
for
aid
from
the
other
or
peered
at
the
now
cold
face
of
dolokhov
and
tried
to
read
what
was
passing
in
his
knows
of
course
what
this
loss
means
to
he
want
my
he
my
i
fond
of
but
not
his
he
to
do
if
he
has
such
and
not
my
fault
he
thought
to
have
done
nothing
have
i
killed
or
insulted
or
wished
harm
to
why
such
a
terrible
and
when
did
it
such
a
little
while
ago
i
came
to
this
table
with
the
thought
of
winning
a
hundred
rubles
to
buy
that
casket
for
name
day
and
then
going
i
was
so
so
so
and
i
did
not
realize
how
happy
i
when
did
that
end
and
when
did
this
terrible
state
of
things
what
marked
the
i
sat
all
the
time
in
this
same
place
at
this
chose
and
placed
and
watched
those
agile
hands
in
the
same
when
did
it
happen
and
what
has
i
am
well
and
strong
and
still
the

in
the
same
it
surely
it
will
all
end
in

was
flushed
and
bathed
in
though
the
room
was
not
his
face
was
terrible
and
piteous
to
especially
from
its
helpless
efforts
to
seem

score
against
him
reached
the
fateful
sum
of
rostov
had
just
prepared
a
by
bending
the
corner
of
which
he
meant
to
double
the
three
thousand
just
put
down
to
his
when
slamming
down
the
pack
of
put
it
aside
and
began
rapidly
adding
up
the
total
of
breaking
the
chalk
as
he
marked
the
figures
in
his
bold
time
for
and
here
are
the
some
swarthy
men
and
women
were
really
entering
from
the
cold
outside
and
saying
something
in
their
gypsy
nicholas
understood
that
it
was
all
but
he
said
in
an
indifferent
you
go
i
had
a
splendid
card
all
as
if
it
were
the
fun
of
the
game
which
interested
him
all
thought
a
bullet
through
my
all
left
and
at
the
same
time
he
said
in
a
cheerful
just
this
one
more
little
said
having
finished
the
he
pointing
to
the
figure
by
which
the
total
exceeded
the
round
sum
of
and
taking
up
a
pack
he
prepared
to
rostov
submissively
unbent
the
corner
of
his
card
instead
of
the
six
thousand
he
had
carefully
wrote
all
the
same
to
he
only
want
to
see
whether
you
will
let
me
win
this
or

dolokhov
began
to
deal
how
rostov
detested
at
that
moment
those
hands
with
their
short
reddish
fingers
and
hairy
which
held
him
in
their
the
ten

to
owe

and
stretching
himself
he
rose
from
the

dolokhov

what
a
shock

would
inflict
on
his
father
and
mother
by
the
news
of
this
he
knew
what
a
relief
it
would
be
to
escape
it
and
felt
that
dolokhov
knew
that
he
could
save
him
from
all
this
shame
and
but
wanted
now
to
play
with
him

exclaimed

left
the
chapter
xv
to
say
and
keep
up

dignified
tone

not
but
to
go
home

and
were
grouped
round

soon
as
nicholas
he
was
enfolded
in
that
poetic
atmosphere
of
love
which
pervaded
the
rostov
household
that
winter
now
after
proposal
and
seemed
to
have
grown
thicker
round
sonya
and
natasha
as
the
air
does
before
a
sonya

in
the
dresses
they
had
worn

ruffled

at
the
clavichord
striking
chords
with
his
short

thrown
back

his

rolling
as
he
with
his
but
true
some
verses
called

he
had
and
to
which
he
was
trying
to
fit
to
my
forsaken
lyre
what
magic
power

me
what
spark

set
my
inmost
soul
on

he
was
singing
in
passionate
gazing
with
his
sparkling
agate
eyes
at
the
frightened
and
happy
exclaimed
she
without
noticing
still
the

with

glancing
into

though
she
noticed
she
was
herself
in
such

spirits
at
that
so
far
from

that
she
purposely
deceived
herself
as
young
people
often
i
am
too
happy
now
to
spoil
my

by
sympathy
with
she

she

as

she
going
to
the
very
middle
of
the
where
she
considered
the
resonance
was
having
lifted
her
head
and
let
her
arms
droop
as
ballet
dancers
rising
energetically
from
her
heels
to
her
stepped
to
the
middle
of
the
room
and
stood
she
seemed
to
answering
the
rapt
gaze
with
which
denisov
followed
what
is
she
so
pleased
thought
looking
at
his

dull
and
natasha
took
the
first
her
throat
her
chest
her
eyes
became
at
that
moment
she
was
oblivious
of
her
and
from
her
smiling
lips
flowed
sounds
which
anyone
may
produce
at
the
same
intervals
and
hold
for
the
same
but
which
leave
you
cold
a
thousand
times
and
the
thousand
and
first
time
thrill
you
and
make
you
that
had
for
the
first
time
begun
to
sing
mainly
because
denisov
so
delighted
in
her
she
no
longer
sang
as
a
there
was
no
longer
in
her
singing
that
painstaking
effect
that
had
been
in
it
but
she
did
not
yet
sing
as
all
the
connoisseurs
who
heard
her
is
not
but
it
is
a
beautiful
voice
that
must
be
only
they
generally
said
this
some
time
after
she
had
finished
while
that
untrained
with
its
incorrect
breathing
and
labored
was
even
the
connoisseurs
said
but
only
delighted
in
it
and
wished
to
hear
it
in
her
voice
there
was
a
virginal
an
unconsciousness
of
her
own
and
an
as
yet
untrained
velvety
which
so
mingled
with
her
lack
of
art
in
singing
that
it
seemed
as
if
nothing
in
that
voice
could
be
altered
without
spoiling
is
thought
listening
to
her
with
widely
opened
has
happened
to
how
she
is
singing
and
suddenly
the
whole
world
centered
for
him
on
anticipation
of
the
next
the
next
and
everything
in
the
world
was
divided
into

her

got
up
without

went
downstairs

quarter
of

in

longed
to
kiss

natasha
ran
across
the
drawing

to
the
dancing
where

was
sitting
on
the

chair
by
the

over

and
she
heard
strange
sounds
she
did
not

kissed
his
rough
curly

at
this
they
heard
the
quick
rustle
of
the

came
up
to

thank
you
for

an
embarrassed

it
sounded
severe
to
my

so
and
i
thought
as

would
have
addressed
yourself
first
to

that
case
you
would
not
have
obliged
me
to
give
this
said
with
downcast
eyes
and
a
guilty
he
tried
to
say
but
natasha
could
not
remain
seeing
him
in
such

on

i
so
adore
your

all
your
family
that
i
would
give
my
life
twice
he
looked
at
the
and
seeing
her
severe
face
and
kissing
her
he
left
the
room
with
quick
resolute
without
looking
at

day
rostov

did
not
wish
to
stay
another
day
in
all
moscow
friends
gave
him
a
farewell
entertainment
at
the
with
the
result
that
he
had
no
recollection
of
how
he
was
put
in
the
sleigh
or
of
the
first
three
stages
of
his
after
rostov
spent
another
fortnight
in
without
going
out
of
the
waiting
for
the
money
his
father
could
not
at
once
and
he
spent
most
of
his
time
in
the
sonya
was
more
tender
and
devoted
to
him
than
it
was
as
if
she
wanted
to
show
him
that
his
losses
were
an
achievement
that
made
her
love
him
all
the
but
nicholas
now
considered
himself
unworthy
of

filled
the
albums
with
verses
and
and
having
at
last
sent
dolokhov
the
whole
thousand
rubles
and
received

i
after
his
interview
with
his
wife
pierre
left
for
at
the
torzhok
post
either
there
were
no
horses
or
the
postmaster
would
not
supply
pierre
was
obliged
to
without
he
lay
down
on
the
leather
sofa
in
front
of
a
round
put
his
big
feet
in
their
overboots
on
the
and
began
to
you
have
the
portmanteaus
brought
and
a
bed
got
and
asked
his
pierre
gave
no
for
he
neither
heard
nor
saw
he
had
begun
to
think
of
the
last
station
and
was
still
pondering
on
the
same
so
important
that
he
took
no
notice
of
what
went
on
around
not
only
was
he
indifferent
as
to
whether
he
got
to
petersburg
earlier
or
or
whether
he
secured
accommodation
at
this
but
compared
to
the
thoughts
that
now
occupied
him
it
was
a
matter
of
indifference
whether
he
remained
there
for
a
few
hours
or
for
the
rest
of
his
the
his
the
and
a
peasant
woman
selling
torzhok
embroidery
came
into
the
room
offering
their
without
changing
his
careless
pierre
looked
at
them
over
his
spectacles
unable
to
understand
what
they
wanted
or
how
they
could
go
on
living
without
having
solved
the
problems
that
so
absorbed
he
had
been
engrossed
by
the
same
thoughts
ever
since
the
day
he
returned
from
sokolniki
after
the
duel
and
had
spent
that
first
sleepless
but
in
the
solitude
of
the
they
seized
him
with
special
no
matter
what
he
thought
he
always
returned
to
these
same
questions
which
he
could
not
solve
and
yet
could
not
cease
to
ask
it
was
as
if
the
thread
of
the
chief
screw
which
held
his
life
together
were
so
that
the
screw
could
not
get
in
or
but
went
on
turning
uselessly
in
the
same
the
postmaster
came
in
and
began
obsequiously
to
beg
his
excellency
to
wait
only
two
come
what
he
would
let
his
excellency
have
the
courier
it
was
plain
that
he
was
lying
and
only
wanted
to
get
more
money
from
the
this
good
or
pierre
asked
is
good
for
bad
for
another
and
for
himself
because
he
needs
money
for
the
man
said
an
officer
had
once
given
him
a
thrashing
for
letting
a
private
traveler
have
the
courier
but
the
officer
thrashed
him
because
he
had
to
get
on
as
quickly
as
and
continued
dolokhov
because
i
considered
myself
and
louis

was
executed
because
they
considered
him

a
year
later
they
executed

executed

what
should
one
love

what
what
does
one
live

what

what
is
what
power

there
was
no
answer
to
any
of
these
except
and
that
not
a
logical

not
at
all
a

all

dying

also

torzhok
peddler
in
a
whining
went
on
offering
her
especially
a
pair
of
goatskin

hundreds
of
rubles
i
know
what
to
do
and
she
stands
in
her
tattered
cloak
looking
timidly
at

what
does
she
want
the
money
as
if
that
money
could
add
a
breadth
to
happiness
or
peace
of
can
anything
in
the
world
make
her
or
me
less
a
prey
to
evil
and
which
ends
all
and
must
come
today
or
at
any
in
an

as
compared

again
he
twisted
the
screw
with
the
stripped
and
again
it
turned
uselessly
in
the
same
his
servant
handed
him
a

began
reading
about

again
said
to

can
know

that
we
know
and
the
height
of
human
everything
within
and
around
him
seemed
and
yet
in
this
very
repugnance
to
all
his
circumstances
pierre
found
a
kind
of
tantalizing
make
bold
to
ask
your
excellency
to
move
a
little
for
this
said
the
entering
the
room
followed
by
another
also
detained
for
lack
of
the
newcomer
was
a
wrinkled
old
with
gray
bushy
eyebrows
overhanging
bright
eyes
of
an
indefinite
grayish
pierre
took
his
feet
off
the
stood
and
lay
down
on
a
bed
that
had
been
got
ready
for
glancing
now
and
then
at
the
with
a
gloomy
and
tired
was
wearily
taking
off
his
wraps
with
the
aid
of
his
and
not
looking
at

a
pair
of
felt
boots
on
his
thin
bony
and
keeping
on
a
sheepskin
the
traveler
sat
down
on
the
leaned
back
his
big
head
with
its
broad
temples
and
and
looked
at
the
and
penetrating
expression
of
that
look
struck
he
felt
a
wish
to
speak
to
the
but
by
the
time
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
ask
him
a
question
about

the
traveler
had
closed
his
his
shriveled
old
hands
were
folded
and
on
the
finger
of
one
of
them
pierre
noticed
a
large
cast
iron
ring
with
a
seal
representing
a
the
stranger
sat
without
either
resting
as
it
seemed
to
sunk
in
profound
and
calm
his
servant
was
also
a
wrinkled
old
without
beard
or
evidently
not
because
he
was
shaven
but
because
they
had

began
to
feel
a
sense
of

the
even

of
entering
into
conversation
with
this
the
servant
brought
back
his
tumbler
turned
upside
with
an
unfinished
bit
of

and
asked
if
anything
more
would
be
to
indicate

did
not

me
the
said
the
the
servant
handed
him
a
book
which
pierre
took
to
be
a
devotional
and
the
traveler
became
absorbed
in

at
all

leaning
with
his

on

his

looked
at
him
and
had
not
time
to
turn
away
when
the
old
opening
his
fixed
his
steady
and
severe
gaze
straight
on
pierre
felt
confused
and
wished
to
avoid
that
but
the
bright
old
eyes
attracted
him
chapter
ii

the
pleasure
of
addressing

said
the
stranger
in
a
deliberate
and
loud
pierre
looked
silently
and
inquiringly
at
him
over

seemed
to
emphasize
the
last
as

to
you
in
moscow
was
a
regret

my

flushed
hurriedly
putting
his
legs
down
from

bent
forward
toward
the

forced
and
timid

for
greater

his
gaze
still
on

moved
aside
on
the
sofa
by
way
of
inviting

to
take
a
seat
beside

reluctant
to
enter
into

sat
down

a
forced
am
very
grateful
to
where
are
you
traveling
the
face
was
not
it
was
even
cold
and
but
in
spite
of
both
the
face
and
words
of
his
new
acquaintance
were
irresistibly
attractive
to
if
for
reason
you
feel
inclined
to
talk
to
said
the
old
my
dear
and
he
suddenly
in
an
unexpected
and
tenderly
paternal
not
at

the

am
very
glad
to
make
your
said

glancing
at

looked
more
closely
at

its

to
he
you
a
i
belong
to
the
brotherhood
of
the
said

looking
deeper

deeper
into

my
own
i
hold
out
a
brotherly
hand
to

said
and
wavering
between
the
confidence
the
personality
of
the
freemason
inspired
in
him
and
his
own
habit
of
ridiculing
the
masonic
am
afraid
i
am
very
far
from

i
to

am
afraid
my
way
of
looking
at
the
world
is
so
opposed
to
yours
that
we
shall
not
understand
one
know
your
said
the
the
view
of
life
you
and
which
you
think
is
the
result
of
your
own
mental
is
the
one
held
by
the
majority
of
and
is
the
invariable
fruit
of
and
forgive
my
dear
but
if
i
had
not
known
it
i
should
not
have
addressed
your
view
of
life
is
a
regrettable
as
i
may
suppose
you
to
be
said
with
a
faint
should
never
dare
to
say
that
i
know
the
said
the
whose
words
struck
pierre
more
and
more
by
their
precision
and
one
can
attain
to
truth
by
only
by
laying
stone
on
stone
with
the
cooperation
of
by
the
millions
of
generations
from
our
forefather
adam
to
our
own
is
that
temple
reared
which
is
to
be
a
worthy
dwelling
place
of
the
great
he
and
closed
his
ought
to
tell
you
that
i
do
not
do
not
believe
in
said
regretfully
and
with
an
feeling
it
essential
to
speak
the
whole
the
mason
looked
intently
at
pierre
and
smiled
as
a
rich
man
with
millions
in
hand
might
smile
at
a
poor
fellow
who
told
him
that
poor
had
not
the
five
rubles
that
would
make
him
you
do
not
know
my
dear
said
the
cannot
know
you
do
not
know
him
and
that
is
why
you
are
i
am
assented
what
am
i
to
know
him
my
dear
and
so
you
are
very
you
do
not
know
but
he
is
he
is
in
he
is
in
my
he
is
in
and
even
in
those
blasphemous
words
thou
hast
just
pronounced
the
mason
in
a
stern
and
tremulous
he
paused
and
evidently
trying
to
calm
he
were
he
said
and
i
would
not
be
speaking
of
my
dear
of
of
are
we
whom
hast
thou
he
suddenly
asked
with
exulting
austerity
and
authority
in
his
invented
if
he
did
not
whence
came
thy
conception
of
the
existence
of
such
an
incomprehensible
didst
and
why
did
the
whole
conceive
the
idea
of
the
existence
of
such
an
incomprehensible
a
being
and
infinite
in
all
his
he
stopped
and
remained
silent
for
a
long
pierre
could
not
and
did
not
wish
to
break
this
but
to
understand
him
is
the
mason
began
looking
not
at
pierre
but
straight
before
and
turning
the
leaves
of
his
book
with
his
old
hands
which
from
excitement
he
could
not
keep
it
were
a
man
whose
existence
thou
didst
doubt
i
could
bring
him
to
could
take
him
by
the
hand
and
show
him
to
but
how
can
an
insignificant
show
his
his
and
all
his
mercy
to
one
who
is
or
who
shuts
his
eyes
that
he
may
not
see
or
understand
him
and
may
not
see
or
understand
his
own
vileness
and
he
paused
art
thou
dreamest
that
thou
art
wise
because
thou
couldst
utter
those
blasphemous
he
went
with
a
somber
and
scornful
thou
art
more
foolish
and
unreasonable
than
a
little
playing
with
the
parts
of
a
skillfully
made
dares
to
say
as
he
does
not
understand
its
he
does
not
believe
in
the
master
who
made
to
know
him
is
for
from
our
forefather
adam
to
our
own
we
labor
to
attain
that
knowledge
and
are
still
infinitely
far
from
our
but
in
our
lack
of
understanding
we
see
only
our
weakness
and
his
pierre
listened
with
swelling
gazing
into
the
face
with
shining
not
interrupting
or
questioning
but
believing
with
his
whole
soul
what
the
stranger
whether
he
accepted
the
wise
reasoning
contained
in
the
or
believed
as
a
child
in
the
tone
of
conviction
and
or
the
tremor
of
the
sometimes
almost
those
brilliant
aged
eyes
grown
old
in
this
or
the
calm
firmness
and
certainty
of
his
which
radiated
from
his
whole
being
which
struck
pierre
especially
by
contrast
with
his
own
dejection
and
any
pierre
longed
with
his
whole
soul
to
believe
and
he
did
and
felt
a
joyful
sense
of
and
return
to
is
not
to
be
apprehended
by
but
by
said
the
do
not
said
feeling
with
dismay
doubts
he
was
afraid
of
any
want
of
any
in
the
he
dreaded
not
to
be
able
to
believe
in
he
it
is
that
the
mind
of
man
cannot
attain
the
knowledge
of
which
you
the
mason
smiled
with
his
gentle
fatherly
highest
wisdom
and
truth
are
like
the
purest
liquid
we
may
wish
to
he
i
receive
that
pure
liquid
into
an
impure
vessel
and
judge
of
its
only
by
the
inner
purification
of
myself
can
i
retain
in
some
degree
of
purity
the
liquid
i
that

said
pierre
highest
wisdom
is
not
founded
on
reason
not
on
those
worldly
sciences

the
into
which
intellectual
knowledge

the
highest

is
the

it
is
necessary

so
before
one
can
it
is
necessary
to
believe
and
to
perfect
and
to
attain
this

have
the
light
called

that
god

implanted

tired
by

leaned
his
arms
on
the
back
of
the
sofa
and
closed
his
pierre
looked
at
that
almost
lifeless
face
and
moved
his
lips
without
uttering
a

wished
to
a
vicious
but
dared
not
break
the
the
mason
cleared
his
throat
as
old
men
and
called
his
about
the
he
without
looking
at
exchange
horses
have
just
answered
the
you
not
rest
tell
them
to
he
really
be
going
away
leaving
me
alone
without
having
told
me
and
without
promising
to
help
thought
rising
with
downcast
and
he
began
to
pace
the
glancing
occasionally
at
the
i
never
thought
of
but
i
have
led
a
contemptible
and
profligate
though
i
did
not
like
it
and
did
not
want
thought
this
man
knows
the
truth
if
he
wished
could
disclose
it
to
pierre
wished
to
say
this
to
the
but
did
not
dare
the
having
packed
his
things
with
his

fastening

when

turned
to
and
said
in
a
tone
of
indifferent
are
you
going
to
my
dear
going

answered
in
a
hesitating
thank
i
agree
with
all
you
have
but
do
not
suppose
me
to
be
so
with
my
whole
soul
i
wish
to
be
what
you
would
have
me
but
i
have
never
had
help
from
but
it
is
above
who
am
to
blame
for
help
teach
and
perhaps
i
pierre
could
not
go
he
gulped
and
turned
the
mason
remained
silent
for
a
long
evidently
comes
from
god
he
such
measure
of
help
as
our
order
can
bestow
it
will
render
my
dear
you
are
going
to

this
to
count
took
out
his
notebook
and
wrote
a
few
words
on
a
large
sheet
of
paper
folded
in
me
to
give
you
a
piece
of
when
you
reach
the
first

some
time
to
solitude
and
and
do
not
resume
your
former
way

seeing
that
his
servant

joseph
alexeevich
as
pierre
saw
from
the
bazdeev
had
been
one
of
the
freemasons
and
even
in
for
a
long
while
after
he
had
pierre
did
not
go
to
bed
or
order
horses
but
paced
up
and
down
the
pondering
over
his
vicious
and
with
a
rapturous
sense
of
beginning
anew
pictured
to
himself
the
virtuous
future
that
seemed
to
him
so
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
been
vicious
only
because
he
had
somehow
forgotten
how
good
it
is
to
be
not
a
trace
of
his
former
doubts
remained
in
his
he
firmly
believed
in
the
possibility
of
the
brotherhood
of
men
united
in
the
aim
of
supporting
one
another
in
the
path
of
and
that
is
how
freemasonry
presented
itself
to

iii
on
reaching
petersburg
pierre
did
not
let
anyone
know
of
his
he
went
nowhere
and
spent
whole
days
in
reading
thomas
a
whose
book
had
been
sent
him
by
someone
one
thing
he
continually
realized
as
he
read
that
the
hitherto
unknown

of
believing
in
the
possibility
of
attaining
and
in
the
possibility
of
active
brotherly
love
among
which
joseph
alexeevich
had
revealed
to
a
week
after
his
the
young
polish
whom
pierre
had
known
slightly
in
petersburg
came
into
his
room
one
evening
in
the
official
and
ceremonious
manner
in
which
second
had
called

having
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
satisfied
himself
that
there
was
nobody
else
in
the
addressed

come
to
you
with
a
message
and
an

said

sitting

very
high
standing

our
brotherhood

made
application
for
you
to
be

proposed

consider
it
a
sacred
duty
to
fulfill
that
do
you
wish
to
enter
the
brotherhood
of
freemasons
under
my
the
austere
tone
of
this
whom
he
had
almost
always
before
met
at
amiably
smiling
in
the
society
of
the
most
brilliant
surprised

willarski
bowed

i
beg
you
to
answer

all
as
a
future

but
as
an
honest
have
you
renounced
your
former

was
silent
throughout
the
to
inquiries
as
to
what
he
must
do
and
how
he
should
willarski
only
replied
that
brothers
more
worthy
than
he
would
test
him
and
that
pierre
had
only
to
tell
the
having
entered
the
courtyard
of
a
large
house
where
the
lodge
had
its
and
having
ascended
a
dark
they
entered
a
small
anteroom
where
they
took
off
their
cloaks
without
the
aid
of
a
from
there
they
passed
into
another
a
man
in
strange
attire
appeared
at
the
stepping
toward
said
something
to
him
in
french
in
an
undertone
and
then
went
up
to
a
small
wardrobe
in
which
pierre
noticed
garments
such
as
he
had
never
seen
having
taken
a
kerchief
from
the
willarski
bound
eyes
with
it
and
tied
it
in
a
knot
catching
some
hairs
painfully
in
the
then
he
drew
his
face
kissed
and
taking
him
by
the
hand
led
him
the
hairs
tied
in
the
knot
hurt
pierre
and
there
were
lines
of
pain
on
his
face
and
a
shamefaced
his
huge
with
arms
hanging
down
and
with
a
though
smiling
moved
after
willarski
with
timid
having
led
him
about
ten
willarski
happens
to
he
must
bear
it
all
manfully
if
you
have
firmly
resolved
to
join
our
nodded
you
hear
a
knock
at
the
you
will
uncover
your
added
wish
you
courage
and
pressing
he
went
left
pierre
went
on
smiling
in
the
same
once
or
twice
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
raised
his
hand
to
the
as
if
wishing
to
take
it
but
let
it
drop
the
five
minutes
spent
with
his
eyes
bandaged
seemed
to
him
an
his
arms
felt
his
legs
almost
gave
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
tired
he
experienced
a
variety
of
most
complex
he
felt
afraid
of
what
would
happen
to
him
and
still
more
afraid
of
showing
his
he
felt
curious
to
know
what
was
going
to
happen
and
what
would
be
revealed
to
but
most
of
he
felt
joyful
that
the
moment
had
come
when
he
would
at
last
start
on
that
path
of
regeneration
and
on
the
actively
virtuous
life
of
which
he
had
been
dreaming
since
he
met
joseph
loud
knocks
were
heard
at
the
pierre
took
the
bandage
off
his
eyes
and
glanced
around
the
room
was
in
black
only
a
small
lamp
was
burning
inside
something
pierre
went
nearer
and
saw
that
the
lamp
stood
on
a
black
table
on
which
lay
an
open
the
book
was
the
and
the
white
thing
with
the
lamp
inside
was
a
human
skull
with
its
cavities
and
after
reading
the
first
words
of
the
the
beginning
was
the
word
and
the
word
was
with
pierre
went
round
the
table
and
saw
a
large
open
box
filled
with
it
was
a
coffin
with
bones
he
was
not
at
all
surprised
by
what
he
hoping
to
enter
on
an
entirely
new
life
quite
unlike
the
old
he
expected
everything
to
be
even
more
unusual
than
what
he
was
a
a
the
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
expected
all
this
and
even
trying
to
stimulate
his
emotions
he
looked
the
brotherhood
of
he
kept
saying
to
associating
these
words
with
vague
yet
joyful
the
door
opened
and
someone
came
by
the
dim
to
which
pierre
had
already
become
he
saw
a
rather
short
having
evidently
come
from
the
light
into
the
the
man
then
moved
with
cautious
steps
toward
the
table
and
placed
on
it
his
small
this
short
man
had
on
a
white
leather
apron
which
covered
his
chest
and
part
of
his
he
had
on
a
kind
of
necklace
above
which
rose
a
high
white
outlining
his
rather
long
face
which
was
lit
up
from
what
have
you
come
asked
the
turning
in
direction
at
a
slight
rustle
made
by
the
have
who
do
not
believe
in
the
truth
of
the
light
and
who
have
not
seen
the
come
what
do
you
seek
from
at
the
moment
the
door
opened
and
the
stranger
came
pierre
felt
a
sense
of
awe
and
veneration
such
as
he
had
experienced
in
his
boyhood
at
he
felt
himself
in
the
presence
of
one
socially
a
complete
yet
nearer
to
him
through
the
brotherhood
of
with
bated
breath
and
beating
heart
he
moved
toward
the
rhetor
which
name
the
brother
who
prepared
a
seeker
for
entrance
into
the
brotherhood
was
drawing
he
recognized
in
the
rhetor
a
man
he
and
it
mortified
him
to
think
that
the
newcomer
was
an
wished
him
simply
a
brother
and
a
virtuous
for
a
long
time
he
could
not
utter
a
so
that
the
rhetor
had
to
repeat
his
desire
pierre
uttered
with
said
and
went
on
at
you
any
idea
of
the
means
by
which
our
holy
order
will
help
you
to
reach
your
said
he
quietly
and
for
in
said
with
a
trembling
voice
and
some
difficulty
in
utterance
due
to
his
excitement
and
to
being
unaccustomed
to
speak
of
abstract
matters
in
is
your
conception
of
imagine
that
freemasonry
is
the
fraternity
and
equality
of
men
who
have
virtuous
said
feeling
ashamed
of
the
inadequacy
of
his
words
for
the
solemnity
of
the
as
he
said
the
rhetor
apparently
satisfied
with
this
you
sought
for
means
of
attaining
your
aim
in
i
considered
it
erroneous
and
did
not
follow
said
so
softly
that
the
rhetor
did
not
hear
him
and
asked
him
what
he
was
have
been
an
answered
are
seeking
for
truth
in
order
to
follow
its
laws
in
your
therefore
you
seek
wisdom
and
is
that
not
said
the
after
a
assented
the
rhetor
cleared
his
crossed
his
gloved
hands
on
his
and
began
to
i
must
disclose
to
you
the
chief
aim
of
our
he
if
this
aim
coincides
with
you
may
enter
our
brotherhood
with
the
first
and
chief
object
of
our
the
foundation
on
which
it
rests
and
which
no
human
power
can
is
the
preservation
and
handing
on
to
posterity
of
a
certain
important
which
has
come
down
to
us
from
the
remotest
even
from
the
first
mystery
on
which
perhaps
the
fate
of
mankind
but
since
this
mystery
is
of
such
a
nature
that
nobody
can
know
or
use
it
unless
he
be
prepared
by
long
and
diligent
not
everyone
can
hope
to
attain
it
hence
we
have
a
secondary
that
of
preparing
our
members
as
much
as
possible
to
reform
their
to
purify
and
enlighten
their
by
means
handed
on
to
us
by
tradition
from
those
who
have
striven
to
attain
this
and
thereby
to
render
them
capable
of
receiving
purifying
and
regenerating
our
members
we
to
improve
the
whole
human
offering
it
in
our
members
an
example
of
piety
and
and
thereby
try
with
all
our
might
to
combat
the
evil
which
sways
the
think
this
over
and
i
will
come
to
you
combat
the
evil
which
sways
the
pierre
and
a
mental
image
of
his
future
activity
in
this
direction
rose
in
his
he
imagined
men
such
as
he
had
himself
been
a
fortnight
and
he
addressed
an
edifying
exhortation
to
he
imagined
to
himself
vicious
and
unfortunate
people
whom
he
would
assist
by
word
and
imagined
oppressors
whose
victims
he
would
of
the
three
objects
mentioned
by
the
this
that
of
improving
especially
appealed
to
the
important
mystery
mentioned
by
the
though
it
aroused
his
did
not
seem
to
him
and
the
second
that
of
purifying
and
regenerating
did
not
much
interest
him
because
at
that
moment
he
felt
with
delight
that
he
was
already
perfectly
cured
of
his
former
faults
and
was
ready
for
all
that
was
half
an
hour
the
rhetor
returned
to
inform
the
seeker
of
the
seven
corresponding
to
the
seven
steps
of
which
every
freemason
should
cultivate
in
these
virtues
the
keeping
of
the
secrets
of
the
obedience
to
those
of
higher
ranks
in
the
love
of
the
love
of
the
seventh
by
the
frequent
thought
of
the
rhetor
bring
yourself
to
regard
it
not
as
a
dreaded
but
as
a
friend
that
frees
the
soul
grown
weary
in
the
labors
of
virtue
from
this
distressful
and
leads
it
to
its
place
of
recompense
and
that
must
be
thought
when
after
these
words
the
rhetor
went
leaving
him
to
solitary
must
be
but
i
am
still
so
weak
that
i
love
my
the
meaning
of
which
is
only
now
gradually
opening
before
but
five
of
the
other
virtues
which
pierre
counting
them
on
his
he
felt
already
in
his
love
of
and
especially
did
not
even
seem
to
him
a
but
a
now
felt
so
glad
to
be
free
from
his
own
lawlessness
and
to
submit
his
will
to
those
who
knew
the
indubitable
he
forgot
what
the
seventh
virtue
was
and
could
not
recall
the
third
time
the
rhetor
came
back
more
quickly
and
asked
pierre
whether
he
was
still
firm
in
his
intention
and
determined
to
submit
to
all
that
would
be
required
of
am
ready
for
said
must
also
inform
said
the
our
order
delivers
its
teaching
not
in
words
only
but
also
by
other
which
may
perhaps
have
a
stronger
effect
on
the
sincere
seeker
after
wisdom
and
virtue
than
mere
this
chamber
with
what
you
see
therein
should
already
have
suggested
to
your
if
it
is
more
than
words
could
you
will
perhaps
also
see
in
your
further
initiation
a
like
method
of
our
order
imitates
the
ancient
societies
that
explained
their
teaching
by
a
said
the
an
emblem
of
something
not
cognizable
by
the
senses
but
which
possesses
qualities
resembling
those
of
the
pierre
knew
very
well
what
a
hieroglyph
but
dared
not
he
listened
to
the
rhetor
in
feeling
from
all
he
said
that
his
ordeal
was
about
to
you
are
i
must
begin
your
said
the
rhetor
coming
closer
to
token
of
generosity
i
ask
you
to
give
me
all
your
i
have
nothing
replied
supposing
that
he
was
asked
to
give
up
all
he
you
have
with
pierre
quickly
took
out
his
purse
and
but
could
not
manage
for
some
time
to
get
the
wedding
ring
off
his
fat
when
that
had
been
the
rhetor
token
of
i
ask
you
to
pierre
took
off
his
and
left
boot
according
to
the
the
mason
drew
the
shirt
back
from
left
and
stooping
down
pulled
up
the
left
leg
of
his
trousers
to
above
the
pierre
hurriedly
began
taking
off
his
right
boot
also
and
was
going
to
tuck
up
the
other
trouser
leg
to
save
this
stranger
the
but
the
mason
told
him
that
was
not
necessary
and
gave
him
a
slipper
for
his
left
with
a
childlike
smile
of
and
which
appeared
on
his
face
against
his
pierre
stood
with
his
arms
hanging
down
and
legs
before
his
brother
and
awaited
his
further
in
token
of
i
ask
you
to
reveal
to
me
your
chief
said
the
i
have
had
so
replied
passion
which
more
than
all
others
caused
you
to
waver
on
the
path
of
said
the
pierre
seeking
a
he
went
over
his
vices
in
his
not
knowing
to
which
of
them
to
give
the
he
said
in
a
scarcely
audible
the
mason
did
not
move
and
for
a
long
time
said
nothing
after
this
at
last
he
moved
up
to
pierre
taking
the
kerchief
that
lay
on
the
again
bound
his
the
last
time
i
say
to
all
your
attention
upon
put
a
bridle
on
your
and
seek
not
in
passion
but
in
your
own
the
source
of
blessedness
is
not
without
us
but
pierre
had
already
long
been
feeling
in
himself
that
refreshing
source
of
blessedness
which
now
flooded
his
heart
with
glad
chapter
iv
soon
after
this
there
came
into
the
dark
chamber
to
fetch
not
the
rhetor
but
whom
he
recognized
by
his
to
fresh
questions
as
to
the
firmness
of
his
resolution
pierre
i
and
with
a
childlike
his
fat
chest
stepping
unevenly
and
timidly
in
one
slippered
and
one
booted
he
while
willarski
held
a
sword
to
his
bare
he
was
conducted
from
that
room
along
passages
that
turned
backwards
and
forwards
and
was
at
last
brought
to
the
doors
of
the
willarski
he
was
answered
by
the
masonic
knock
with
the
doors
opened
before
a
bass
voice
was
still
questioned
him
as
to
who
he
when
and
where
he
was
and
so
then
he
was
again
led
somewhere
still
and
as
they
went
along
he
was
told
allegories
of
the
toils
of
his
of
holy
of
the
eternal
architect
of
the
and
of
the
courage
with
which
he
should
endure
toils
and
during
these
pierre
noticed
that
he
was
spoken
of
now
as
the
now
as
the
and
now
as
the
to
the
accompaniment
of
various
knockings
with
mallets
and
as
he
was
being
led
up
to
some
object
he
noticed
a
hesitation
and
uncertainty
among
his
he
heard
those
around
him
disputing
in
whispers
and
one
of
them
insisting
that
he
should
be
led
along
a
certain
after
that
they
took
his
right
placed
it
on
and
told
him
to
hold
a
pair
of
compasses
to
his
left
breast
with
the
other
hand
and
to
repeat
after
someone
who
read
aloud
an
oath
of
fidelity
to
the
laws
of
the
the
candles
were
then
extinguished
and
some
spirit
as
pierre
knew
by
the
and
he
was
told
that
he
would
now
see
the
lesser
the
bandage
was
taken
off
his
eyes
by
the
faint
light
of
the
burning
as
in
a
saw
several
men
standing
before
wearing
aprons
like
the
and
holding
swords
in
their
hands
pointed
at
his
among
them
stood
a
man
whose
white
shirt
was
stained
with

seeing
pierre
moved
forward
with
his
breast
toward
the
meaning
them
to
pierce
but
the
swords
were
drawn
back
from
him
and
he
was
at
once
blindfolded

hast
seen
the
lesser

a
then
the
candles
were
relit
and
he
was
told
that
he
would
see
the
full
the
bandage
was
again
removed
and
more
than
ten
voices
said
transit
gloria
pierre
gradually
began
to
recover
himself
and
looked
about
at
the
room
and
at
the
people
in
round
a
long
table
covered
with
black
sat
some
twelve
men
in
garments
like
those
he
had
already
some
of
them
pierre
had
met
in
petersburg
in
the
chair
sat
a
young
man
he
did
not
with
a
peculiar
cross
hanging
from
his
on
his
right
sat
the
italian
abbe
whom
pierre
had
met
at
anna
two
years
there
were
also
present
a
very
distinguished
dignitary
and
a
swiss
who
had
formerly
been
tutor

a
solemn
listening
to
the
words
of
the
who
held
a
mallet
in
his
let
into
the
wall
was
a
at
one
side
of
the
table
was
a
small
carpet
with
various
figures
worked
upon
at
the
other
was
something
resembling
an
altar
on
which
lay
a
testament
and
a
round
it
stood
seven
large
candlesticks
like
those
used
in
two
of
the
brothers
led
pierre
up
to
the
placed
his
feet
at
right
and
bade
him
lie
saying
that
he
must
prostrate
himself
at
the
gates
of
the
must
first
receive
the
whispered
one
of
the
said
looked
round
with
his
shortsighted
eyes
without
and
suddenly
doubts
arose
in
his
am
what
am
i
they
laughing
at
i
be
ashamed
to
remember
but
these
doubts
only
lasted
a
pierre
glanced
at
the
serious
faces
of
those
remembered
all
he
had
already
gone
and
realized
that
he
could
not
stop
he
was
aghast
at
his
hesitation
trying
to
arouse
his
former
devotional
prostrated
himself
before
the
gates
of
the
and
the
feeling
of
devotion
returned
to
him
even
more
strongly
than
when
he
had
lain
there
some
he
was
told
to
get
and
a
white
leather
such
as
the
others
was
put
on
he
was
given
a
trowel
and
three
pairs
of
and
then
the
grand
master
addressed
he
told
him
that
he
should
try
to
do
nothing
to
stain
the
whiteness
of
that
which
symbolized
strength
and
then
of
the
unexplained
he
told
him
to
toil
with
it
to
cleanse
his
own
heart
from
and
indulgently
to
smooth
with
it
the
heart
of
his
as
to
the
first
pair
of
a
he
said
that
pierre
could
not
know
their
meaning
but
must
keep
the
second
pair
of
gloves
he
was
to
wear
at
the
and
finally
of
the
a
pair
of
he
these
gloves
are
intended
for

them
to
the
woman
whom
you
shall
honor

of
this
gift

be
a

of
your
purity
of

you

worthy

after
a

that
these
gloves
do
not
deck
hands
that
are
while
the
grand
master
said
these
last
words
it
seemed
to
pierre
that
he
grew
pierre
himself
grew
still
more
blushed
like
a
child
till
tears
came
to
his
began
looking
about
him
and
an
awkward
pause
this
silence
was
broken
by
one
of
the
who
led
pierre
up
to
the
rug
and
began
reading
to
him
from
a
manuscript
book
an
explanation
of
all
the
figures
on
the
the

a
plumb

a
rough

a
squared

so
then
a
place
was
assigned
to

shown
the
signs
of
the
told

and
at
last
was
permitted
to
sit

reading

were
very
and
from

was
not
in
a
state
to
understand
what

managed
to
follow
only
the
last
words

finished
getting
embraced
and
kissed
with
tears
of
joy
in
his
looked
round
not
knowing
how
to
answer
the
congratulations
and
greetings
from
acquaintances
that
met
him
on
all
he
acknowledged
no
acquaintances
but
saw
in
all
these

only
and
burned
with
impatience
to

to
work
with

grand
master

with
his
all
the
masons

down
in
their
and
one
of
them
read
an
exhortation
on
the
necessity
of

that

duty
should
be

round
to

have
liked
to
subscribe
all

but
fearing
that
it
might
look
like
pride
subscribed
the
same
amount
as
the
the
meeting
was
at
an
and
on
reaching
home

felt
as
if
he
had
returned
from
a
long
journey
on
which
he
had
spent
dozens
of
had
become
completely
and
had
quite
left
behind
his
former
habits
and
way
of
chapter
v
the
day
after
he
had
been
received
into
the
pierre
was
sitting
at
home
reading
a
book
and
trying
to
fathom
the
significance
of
the
one
side
of
which
symbolized
another
moral
a
third
physical
and
the
fourth
a
combination
of
now
and
then
his
attention
wandered
from
the
book
and
the
square
and
he
formed
in
imagination
a
new
plan
of
on
the
previous
evening
at
the
he
had
heard
that
a
rumor
of
his
duel
had
reached
the
emperor
and
that
it
would
be
wiser
for
him
to
leave
pierre
proposed
going
to
his
estates
in
the
south
and
there
attending
to
the
welfare
of
his
he
was
joyfully
planning
this
new
when
prince
vasili
suddenly
entered
the
dear
what
have
you
been
up
to
in
why
have
you
quarreled
with
mon
you
are
under
a
said
prince
as
he
know
all
about
and
i
can
tell
you
positively
that
helene
is
as
innocent
before
you
as
christ
was
before
the
pierre
was
about
to
but
prince
vasili
interrupted
why
you
simply
come
straight
to
me
as
to
a
i
know
all
about
it
and
understand
it
he
behaved
as
becomes
a
man
who
values
his
perhaps
too
but
we
go
into
but
consider
the
position
in
which
you
are
placing
her
and
me
in
the
eyes
of
and
even
of
the
he
lowering
his
is
living
in
moscow
and
you
are
dear
and
he
drew
arm
is
simply
a
i
expect
you
feel
it
so
let
us
write
her
a
letter
at
and
come
here
and
all
will
be
or
my
dear
let
me
tell
you
quite
likely
have
to
suffer
for
prince
vasili
gave
pierre
a
significant
know
from
reliable
sources
that
the
dowager
empress
is
taking
a
keen
interest
in
the
whole
you
know
she
is
very
gracious
to
pierre
tried
several
times
to
on
one
prince
vasili
did
not
let
him
on
the
pierre
himself
feared
to
begin
to
speak
in
the
tone
of
decided
refusal
and
disagreement
in
which
he
had
firmly
resolved
to
answer
his
the
words
of
the
masonic
kindly
and
recurred
to
he
went
got
up
and
sat
down
struggling
with
himself
to
do
what
was
for
him
the
most
difficult
thing
in
say
an
unpleasant
thing
to
a
to
say
what
the
whoever
he
might
did
not
he
was
so
used
to
submitting
to
prince
tone
of
careless
that
he
felt
he
would
be
unable
to
withstand
it
but
he
also
felt
that
on
what
he
said
now
his
future
he
would
follow
the
same
old
or
that
new
path
so
attractively
shown
him
by
the
on
which
he
firmly
believed
he
would
be
reborn
to
a
new
dear
said
prince
vasili
and
write
to
her
and
we
will
kill
the
fatted
but
before
prince
vasili
had
finished
his
playful
without
looking
at
and
with
a
kind
of
fury
that
made
him
like
his
muttered
in
a
i
did
not
ask
you
please
and
he
jumped
up
and
opened
the
door
for
he
amazed
at
himself
and
glad
to
see
the
look
of
confusion
and
fear
that
showed
itself
on
prince
the
matter
with
are
you
the
quivering
voice
and
prince
vasili
had
to
go
without
receiving
any
a
week
having
taken
leave
of
his
new
the
and
leaving
large
sums
of
money
with
them
for
went
away
to
his
his
new
brethren
gave
him
letters
to
the
kiev
and
odessa
masons
and
promised
to
write
to
him
and
guide
him
in
his
new
chapter
vi
the
duel
between
pierre
and
dolokhov
was
hushed
up
in
spite
of
the
severity
regarding
duels
at
that
neither
the
principals
nor
their
seconds
suffered
for
but
the
story
of
the
confirmed
by
rupture
with
his
was
the
talk
of
pierre
who
had
been
regarded
with
patronizing
condescension
when
he
was
an
illegitimate
and
petted
and
extolled
when
he
was
the
best
match
in
had
sunk
greatly
in
the
esteem
of
society
after
his
when
the
marriageable
daughters
and
their
mothers
had
nothing
to
hope
from
as
he
did
not
know
and
did
not
to
court
now
he
alone
was
blamed
for
what
had
he
was
said
to
be
insanely
jealous
and
subject
like
his
father
to
fits
of
bloodthirsty
and
when
after
departure
helene
returned
to
she
was
received
by
all
her
acquaintances
not
only
but
even
with
a
shade
of
deference
due
to
her
when
conversation
turned
on
her
husband
helene
assumed
a
dignified
which
with
characteristic
tact
she
had
acquired
though
she
did
not
understand
its
this
expression
suggested
that
she
had
resolved
to
endure
her
troubles
uncomplainingly
and
that
her
husband
was
a
cross
laid
upon
her
by
prince
vasili
expressed
his
opinion

he
shrugged
his
shoulders
when
pierre
was
mentioned
pointing
to
his
bit

before
anyone
insisted
on
her
that
senseless
young
man
was
spoiled
by
the
depraved
ideas
of
these
i
said
so
even
at
the
time
when
everybody
was
in
raptures
about
when
he
had
just
returned
from

if

he
posed

then
and
foretold
all

to
give
on
free
evenings
the

kind
of
soirees
as
as
she
alone
had
the
gift

which
was
to
be

good
the
bloom
of
the
intellectual
essence
of
as
she
herself
put
besides
this
refined
selection
of
society
anna
receptions
were
also
distinguished
by
the
fact
that
she
always
presented
some
new
and
interesting
person
to
the
visitors
and
that
nowhere
else
was
the
state
of
the
political
thermometer
of
legitimate
petersburg
court
society
so
dearly
and
distinctly
toward
the
end
of
when
all
the
sad
details
of
destruction
of
the
prussian
army
at
jena
and
auerstadt
and
the
surrender
of
most
of
the
prussian
fortresses
had
been
when
our
troops
had
already
entered
prussia
and
our
second

with
napoleon
was

of
the
fascinating

by
her
the
delightful
prince
hippolyte
who
had
just
returned
from
two

young
man
referred
to
in

as
man

honor
and
her
and
several
other
less
noteworthy
the
novelty
anna
pavlovna
was
setting
before
her
guests
that
evening
was
boris
who
had
just
arrived
as
a
special
messenger
from
the
prussian
army
and
was
to
a
very
important
the
temperature
shown
by
the
political
thermometer
to
the
company
that
evening
was

and
commanders
may
do
to
countenance
and
to
cause
and
us
in
annoyance
and
our
opinion
of
bonaparte
cannot
we
shall
not
cease
to
express
our
sincere
views
on
that
and
can
only
say
to
the
king
of
prussia
and
much
the
worse
for
tu
george
all
we
have
to
say
about
when
who
was
to
be
served
up
to
the
entered
the
drawing
almost
all
the
company
had
and
the
guided
by
anna
was
about
our
diplomatic
relations
with
austria
and
the
hope
of
an
alliance
with
grown
more
manly
and
looking
rosy
and
entered
the
drawing
room
elegantly
dressed
in
the
uniform
of
an
camp
and
was
duly
conducted
to
pay
his
respects
to
the
aunt
and
then
brought
back
to
the
general
anna
pavlovna
gave
him
her
shriveled
hand
to
kiss
and
introduced
him
to
several
persons
whom
he
did
not
giving
him
a
whispered
description
of
hippolyte
the
charge
from
profound
and
man
of
great
of
the
man
usually
so
thanks
to
anna
his
own
and
the
peculiarities
of
his
reserved
boris
had
managed
during
his
service
to
place
himself
very
he
was
to
a
very
important
had
been
sent
on
a
very
important
mission
to
and
had
just
returned
from
there
as
a
special
he
had
become
thoroughly
conversant
with
that
unwritten
code
with
which
he
had
been
so
pleased
at
olmutz
and
according
to
which
an
ensign
might
rank
incomparably
higher
than
a
and
according
to
which
what
was
needed
for
success
in
the
service
was
not
effort
or
or
or
but
only
the
knowledge
of
how
to
get
on
with
those
who
can
grant
and
he
was
himself
often
surprised
at
the
rapidity
of
his
success
and
at
the
inability
of
others
to
understand
these
in
consequence
of
this
discovery
his
whole
manner
of
all
his
relations
with
old
all
his
plans
for
his
were
completely
he
was
not
but
would
spend
his
last
groat
to
be
better
dressed
than
and
would
rather
deprive
himself
of
many
pleasures
than
allow
himself
to
be
seen
in
a
shabby
equipage
or
appear
in
the
streets
of
petersburg
in
an
old
he
made
friends
with
and
sought
the
acquaintance
of
only
those
above
him
in
position
and
who
could
therefore
be
of
use
to
he
liked
petersburg
and
despised
the
remembrance
of
the
house
and
of
his
childish
love
for
natasha
was
unpleasant
to
him
and
he
had
not
once
been
to
see
the
rostovs
since
the
day
of
his
departure
for
the
to
be
in
anna
drawing
room
he
considered
an
important
step
up
in
the
and
he
at
once
understood
his
letting
his
hostess
make
use
of
whatever
interest
he
had
to
he
himself
carefully
scanned
each
appraising
the
possibilities
of
establishing
intimacy
with
each
of
those
and
the
advantages
that
might
he
took
the
seat
indicated
to
him
beside
the
fair
helene
and
listened
to
the
general
considers
the
bases
of
the
proposed
treaty
so
unattainable
that
not
even
a
continuity
of
most
brilliant
successes
would
secure
and
she
doubts
the
means
we
have
of
gaining
that
is
the
actual
phrase
used
by
the
vienna
said
the
danish
charge
doubt
is
said
man
of
profound
with
a
subtle
must
distinguish
between
the
vienna
cabinet
and
the
emperor
of
said
emperor
of
austria
can
never
have
thought
of
such
a
it
is
only
the
cabinet
that
says
my
dear
put
in
anna
some
reason
she
called
it
urope
as
if
that
were
a
specially
refined
french
pronunciation
which
she
could
allow
herself
when
conversing
with
a
ne
sera
jamais
notre
alliee
will
never
be
our
sincere
after
that
anna
pavlovna
led
up
to
the
courage
and
firmness
of
the
king
of
in
order
to
draw
boris
into
the
boris
listened
attentively
to
each
of
the
awaiting
his
but
managed
meanwhile
to
look
round
repeatedly
at
his
the
beautiful
whose
eyes
several
times
met
those
of
the
handsome
young
with
a
speaking
of
the
position
of
anna
pavlovna
very
naturally
asked
boris
to
tell
them
about
his
journey
to
glogau
and
in
what
state
he
found
the
prussian
speaking
with
told
them
in
correct
french
many
interesting
details
about
the
armies
and
the
carefully
abstaining
from
expressing
an
opinion
of
his
own
about
the
facts
he
was
for
some
time
he
engrossed
the
general
and
anna
pavlovna
felt
that
the
novelty
she
had
served
up
was
received
with
pleasure
by
all
her
the
greatest
attention
of
all
to
narrative
was
shown
by
she
asked
him
several
questions
about
his
journey
and
seemed
greatly
interested
in
the
state
of
the
prussian
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
she
turned
to
him
with
her
usual
absolutely
must
come
and
see
she
said
in
a
tone
that
implied
for
certain
considerations
he
could
not
know
this
was
absolutely
tuesday
between
eight
and
it
will
give
me
great
boris
promised
to
fulfill
her
wish
and
was
about
to
begin
a
conversation
with
when
anna
pavlovna
called
him
away
on
the
pretext
that
her
aunt
wished
to
hear
know
her
of
said
anna
closing
her
eyes
and
indicating
helene
with
a
sorrowful
she
is
such
an
unfortunate
and
charming
mention
him
before
it
is
too
painful
for
chapter
vii
when
boris
and
anna
pavlovna
returned
to
the
others
prince
hippolyte
had
the
ear
of
the
bending
forward
in
his
armchair
he
roi
de
and
having
said
this
everyone
turned
toward
roi
de
hippolyte
said
again
and
then
calmly
and
seriously
sat
back
in
his
anna
pavlovna
waited
for
him
to
go
but
as
he
seemed
quite
decided
to
say
no
more
she
began
to
tell
of
how
at
potsdam
the
impious
bonaparte
had
stolen
the
sword
of
frederick
the
is
the
sword
of
frederick
the
great
which
she
but
hippolyte
interrupted
her
with
the
roi
de
and
as
soon
as
all
turned
toward
excused
himself
and
said
no
anna
pavlovna
addressed
him
what
about
your
roi
de
hippolyte
laughed
as
if
ashamed
of
i
only
wished
to
wanted
to
repeat
a
joke
he
had
heard
in
vienna
and
which
he
had
been
trying
all
that
evening
to
get
only
wished
to
say
that
we
are
wrong
to
fight
pour
le
roi
de
boris
smiled
so
that
it
might
be
taken
as
ironical
or
appreciative
according
to
the
way
the
joke
was
everybody
joke
is
too
witty
but
said
anna
shaking
her
little
shriveled
finger
at
are
not
fighting
pour
le
roi
de
but
for
right
that
wicked
prince
she
the
conversation
did
not
flag
all
evening
and
turned
chiefly
on
the
political
it
became
particularly
animated
toward
the
end
of
the
evening
when
the
rewards
bestowed
by
the
emperor
were
know
received
a
snuffbox
with
the
portrait
last
said
man
of
profound
get
the
same
a
snuffbox
with
the
portrait
is
a
reward
but
not
a
said
the
are
i
may
mention
replied
you
the
ribbon
of
the
order
is
a
different
when
everybody
rose
to
helene
who
had
spoken
very
little
all
the
evening
again
turned
to
asking
him
in
a
tone
of
caressing
significant
command
to
come
to
her
on
is
of
great
importance
to
she
turning
with
a
smile
toward
anna
and
anna
with
the
same
sad
smile
with
which
she
spoke
of
her
exalted
supported
it
seemed
as
if
from
some
words
boris
had
spoken
that
evening
about
the
prussian
helene
had
suddenly
found
it
necessary
to
see
she
seemed
to
promise
to
explain
that
necessity
to
him
when
he
came
on
but
on
tuesday
having
come
to
splendid
boris
received
no
clear
explanation
of
why
it
had
been
necessary
for
him
to
there
were
other
guests
and
the
countess
talked
little
to
and
only
as
he
kissed
her
hand
on
taking
leave
said
unexpectedly
and
in
a
with
a
strangely
unsmiling
to
dinner
in
the
you
must
during
that
stay
in
boris
became
an
intimate
in
the
chapter
viii
the
war
was
flaming
up
and
nearing
the
russian
everywhere
one
heard
curses
on
enemy
of
militiamen
and
recruits
were
being
enrolled
in
the
and
from
the
seat
of
war
came
contradictory
false
as
usual
and
therefore
variously
the
life
of
old
prince
prince
and
princess
mary
had
greatly
changed
since
in
1806
the
old
prince
was
made
one
of
the
eight
commanders
in
chief
then
appointed
to
supervise
the
enrollment
decreed
throughout
despite
the
weakness
of
which
had
become
particularly
noticeable
since
the
time
when
he
thought
his
son
had
been
he
did
not
think
it
right
to
refuse
a
duty
to
which
he
had
been
appointed
by
the
emperor
and
this
fresh
opportunity
for
action
gave
him
new
energy
and
he
was
continually
traveling
through
the
three
provinces
entrusted
to
was
pedantic
in
the
fulfillment
of
his
severe
to
cruel
with
his
and
went
into
everything
down
to
the
minutest
details
princess
mary
had
ceased
taking
lessons
in
mathematics
from
her
and
when
the
old
prince
was
at
home
went
to
his
study
with
the
wet
nurse
and
little
prince
nicholas
his
grandfather
called
the
baby
prince
nicholas
lived
with
his
wet
nurse
and
nurse
savishna
in
the
late
rooms
and
princess
mary
spent
most
of
the
day
in
the
taking
a
place
to
her
little
nephew
as
best
she
mademoiselle
seemed
passionately
fond
of
the
and
princess
mary
often
deprived
herself
to
give
her
friend
the
pleasure
of
dandling
the
little
she
called
her
playing
with
near
the
altar
of
the
church
at
bald
hills
there
was
a
chapel
over
the
tomb
of
the
little
and
in
this
chapel
was
a
marble
monument
brought
from
representing
an
angel
with
outspread
wings
ready
to
fly
the
upper
lip
was
slightly
raised
as
though
about
to
and
once
on
coming
out
of
the
chapel
prince
andrew
and
princess
mary
admitted
to
one
another
that
the
face
reminded
them
strangely
of
the
little
but
what
was
still
though
of
this
prince
andrew
said
nothing
to
his
was
that
in
the
expression
the
sculptor
had
happened
to
give
the
prince
andrew
read
the
same
mild
reproach
he
had
read
on
the
face
of
his
dead
why
have
you
done
this
to
soon
after
prince
return
the
old
prince
made
over
to
him
a
large
about
miles
from
bald
partly
because
of
the
depressing
memories
associated
with
bald
partly
because
prince
andrew
did
not
always
feel
equal
to
bearing
with
his
and
partly
because
he
needed
prince
andrew
made
use
of

building
and
spent
most
of
his
time
after
the
austerlitz
campaign
prince
andrew
had
firmly
resolved
not
to
continue
his
military
and
when
the
war
recommenced
and
everybody
had
to

took
a
post
under
his
father
in
the
recruitment
so
as
to
avoid
active
the
old
prince
and
his
son
seemed
to
have
changed
roles
since
the
campaign
of
the
old

by
expected
the
best
results
from
the
new
while
prince
andrew
on
the
taking
no
part
in
the
war
and
secretly
regretting
saw

still
had
all
the
letters
in
his
opening

mechanically
he
began
the
old
now
and
then
using
wrote
in
his
large
elongated
hand
on
blue
paper
as
have
just
this
moment

by
special
messenger

joyful

obtained
a
complete
victory

and
the
rewards

to
the
army
are
though
he
is
a
congratulate

make
out
what
the
commander
at
certain
up
till
now
the
additional
men
and

not

at
once
and
say

his
head
off
if
everything
is
not
here
in
a
have
received
another
letter
about
the
battle
from
took
part
in
all
when
meddle
even
a
german
beats
he
is
said
to
be
fleeing
in
great
mind
you
gallop
off
to
korchevo
without
delay
and
carry
out
prince
andrew
sighed
and
broke
the
seal
of
another
it
was
a
closely
written
letter
of
two
sheets
from
he
folded
it
up
without
reading
it
and
reread
his
ending
with
the
off
to
korchevo
and
carry
out
pardon
i
go
now
till
the
child
is
thought
going
to
the
door
and
looking
into
the
princess
mary
was
still
standing
by
the
gently
rocking
the
and
what
else
did
he
say
thought
prince
recalling
his
we
have
gained
a
victory
over
just
when
not
always
poking
fun
at
let
and
he
began
reading
letter
which
was
written
in
he
read
without
understanding
half
of
read
only
to
if
but
for
a
what
he
had
too
long
been
thinking
of
so
painfully
to
the
exclusion
of
all
chapter
ix
bilibin
was
now
at
army
headquarters
in
a
diplomatic
and
though
he
wrote
in
french
and
used
french
jests
and
french
he
described
the
whole
campaign
with
a
fearless
and
derision
genuinely
bilibin
wrote
that
the
obligation
of
diplomatic
discretion
tormented
and
he
was
happy
to
have
in
prince
andrew
a
reliable
correspondent
to
whom
he
could
pour
out
the
bile
he
had
accumulated
at
the
sight
of
all
that
was
being
done
in
the
the
letter
was
having
been
written
before
the
battle
at
the
day
of
our
brilliant
success
at
wrote
you
my
dear
i
never
leave
i
have
certainly
acquired
a
taste
for
and
it
is
just
as
well
for
what
i
have
seen
during
these
last
three
months
is
begin
ab
enemy
of
the
human
as
you
attacks
the
the
prussians
are
our
faithful
allies
who
have
only
betrayed
us
three
times
in
three
we
take
up
their
but
it
turns
out
that
enemy
of
the
human
pays
no
heed
to
our
fine
speeches
and
in
his
rude
and
savage
way
throws
himself
on
the
prussians
without
giving
them
time
to
finish
the
parade
they
had
and
in
two
twists
of
the
hand
he
breaks
them
to
smithereens
and
installs
himself
in
the
palace
at
most
ardently
writes
the
king
of
prussia
to
your
majesty
should
be
received
and
treated
in
my
palace
in
a
manner
agreeable
to
and
in
so
far
as
circumstances
i
have
hastened
to
take
all
steps
to
that
may
i
have
the
prussian
generals
pride
themselves
on
being
polite
to
the
french
and
lay
down
their
arms
at
the
first
head
of
the
garrison
at
with
ten
thousand
asks
the
king
of
prussia
what
he
is
to
do
if
he
is
summoned
to
all
this
is
absolutely
hoping
to
settle
matters
by
taking
up
a
warlike
it
turns
out
that
we
have
landed
ourselves
in
and
what
is
in
war
on
our
own
with
and
for
the
king
of
we
have
everything
in
perfect
only
one
little
thing
is
a
commander
in
as
it
was
considered
that
the
austerlitz
success
might
have
been
more
decisive
had
the
not
been
so
all
our
octogenarians
were
and
of
prozorovski
and
kamenski
the
latter
was
the
general
comes
to
in
a
and
is
received
with
acclamations
of
joy
and
the
the
first
courier
arrives
from
the
mails
are
taken
to
the
field
for
he
likes
to
do
everything
i
am
called
in
to
help
sort
the
letters
and
take
those
meant
for
the
field
marshal
looks
on
and
waits
for
letters
addressed
to
we
but
none
are
to
be
the
field
marshal
grows
impatient
and
sets
to
work
himself
and
finds
letters
from
the
emperor
to
count
prince
and
then
he
bursts
into
one
of
his
wild
furies
and
rages
at
everyone
and
seizes
the
opens
and
reads
those
from
the
emperor
addressed
to
so
the
way
they
treat
no
confidence
in
ordered
to
keep
an
eye
on
very
well
get
along
with
so
he
writes
the
famous
order
of
the
day
to
general
am
wounded
and
cannot
ride
and
consequently
cannot
command
the
you
have
brought
your
army
corps
to
here
it
is
and
without
fuel
or
so
something
must
be
as
you
yourself
reported
to
count
buxhowden
you
must
think
of
retreating
to
our
do
all
my
he
writes
to
the
have
got
a
saddle
sore
coming
after
all
my
previous
quite
prevents
my
riding
and
commanding
so
vast
an
so
i
have
passed
on
the
command
to
the
general
next
in
count
having
sent
him
my
whole
staff
and
all
that
belongs
to
advising
him
if
there
is
a
lack
of
to
move
farther
into
the
interior
of
for
only
one
ration
of
bread
and
in
some
regiments
none
at
as
reported
by
the
division
ostermann
and
and
all
that
the
peasants
had
has
been
eaten
i
myself
will
remain
in
hospital
at
ostrolenka
till
i
in
regard
to
which
i
humbly
submit
my
with
the
information
that
if
the
army
remains
in
its
present
bivouac
another
fortnight
there
will
not
be
a
healthy
man
left
in
it
by
leave
to
retire
to
his
country
seat
to
an
old
man
who
is
already
in
any
case
dishonored
by
being
unable
to
fulfill
the
great
and
glorious
task
for
which
he
was
i
shall
await
your
most
gracious
permission
here
in
that
i
may
not
have
to
play
the
part
of
a
secretary
rather
than
commander
in
the
my
removal
from
the
army
does
not
produce
the
slightest
blind
man
has
left
there
are
thousands
such
as
i
in
field
marshal
is
angry
with
the
emperor
and
he
punishes
us
it
is
the
first
those
that
follow
are
naturally
increasingly
interesting
and
after
the
field
departure
it
appears
that
we
are
within
sight
of
the
enemy
and
must
give
buxhowden
is
by
but
general
bennigsen
does
not
quite
see
more
particularly
as
it
is
he
and
his
corps
who
are
within
sight
of
the
enemy
and
he
wishes
to
profit
by
the
opportunity
to
fight
a
battle
his
own
as
the
germans
he
does
this
is
the
battle
of
which
is
considered
a
great
victory
but
in
my
opinion
was
nothing
of
the
we
as
you
have
a
very
bad
way
of
deciding
whether
a
battle
was
won
or
those
who
retreat
after
a
battle
have
lost
it
is
what
we
and
according
to
that
it
is
we
who
lost
the
battle
of
in
we
retreat
after
the
battle
but
send
a
courier
to
petersburg
with
news
of
a
and
general
hoping
to
receive
from
petersburg
the
post
of
commander
in
chief
as
a
reward
for
his
does
not
give
up
the
command
of
the
army
to
general
during
this
interregnum
we
begin
a
very
original
and
interesting
series
of
our
aim
is
no
as
it
should
to
avoid
or
attack
the
but
solely
to
avoid
general
buxhowden
who
by
right
of
seniority
should
be
our
so
energetically
do
we
pursue
this
aim
that
after
crossing
an
unfordable
river
we
burn
the
bridges
to
separate
ourselves
from
our
who
at
the
moment
is
not
bonaparte
but
general
buxhowden
was
all
but
attacked
and
captured
by
a
superior
enemy
force
as
a
result
of
one
of
these
maneuvers
that
enabled
us
to
escape
buxhowden
pursues
he
hardly
crosses
the
river
to
our
side
before
we
recross
to
the
at
last
our
catches
us
and
both
generals
are
and
the
result
is
a
challenge
on
part
and
an
epileptic
fit
on
but
at
the
critical
moment
the
courier
who
carried
the
news
of
our
victory
at
pultusk
to
petersburg
returns
bringing
our
appointment
as
and
our
first
is
we
can
now
turn
our
thoughts
to
the
but
as
it
turns
just
at
that
moment
a
third
enemy
rises
before
the
orthodox
russian
loudly
demanding
and
the
stores
are
the
roads
the
orthodox
begin
and
in
a
way
of
which
our
last
campaign
can
give
you
no
half
the
regiments
form
bands
and
scour
the
countryside
and
put
everything
to
fire
and
the
inhabitants
are
totally
the
hospitals
overflow
with
and
famine
is
twice
the
marauders
even
attack
our
and
the
has
to
ask
for
a
battalion
to
disperse
during
one
of
these
attacks
they
carried
off
my
empty
portmanteau
and
my
dressing
the
emperor
proposes
to
give
all
commanders
of
divisions
the
right
to
shoot
but
i
much
fear
this
will
oblige
one
half
the
army
to
shoot
the
at
first
prince
andrew
read
with
his
eyes
but
after
a
in
spite
of
himself
he
knew
how
far
it
was
safe
to
trust
what
he
had
read
began
to
interest
him
more
and
when
he
had
read
thus
he
crumpled
the
letter
up
and
threw
it
it
was
not
what
he
had
read
that
vexed
but
the
fact
that
the
life
out
there
in
which
he
had
now
no
part
could
perturb
he
shut
his
rubbed
his
forehead
as
if
to
rid
himself
of
all
interest
in
what
he
had
and
listened
to
what
was
passing
in
the
suddenly
he
thought
he
heard
a
strange
noise
through
the
he
was
seized
with
alarm
lest
something
should
have
happened
to
the
child
while
he
was
reading
the
he
went
on
tiptoe
to
the
nursery
door
and
opened
just
as
he
went
in
he
saw
that
the
nurse
was
hiding
something
from
him
with
a
scared
look
and
that
princess
mary
was
no
longer
by
the
he
heard
what
seemed
to
him
her
despairing
whisper
behind
as
often
happens
after
long
sleeplessness
and
long
he
was
seized
by
an
unreasoning
occurred
to
him
that
the
child
was
all
that
he
saw
and
heard
seemed
to
confirm
this
is
he
and
a
cold
sweat
broke
out
on
his
he
went
to
the
cot
in
sure
that
he
would
find
it
empty
and
that
the
nurse
had
been
hiding
the
dead
he
drew
the
curtain
aside
and
for
some
time
his
restless
eyes
could
not
find
the
at
last
he
saw
the
rosy
boy
had
tossed
about
till
he
lay
across
the
bed
with
his
head
lower
than
the
and
was
smacking
his
lips
in
his
sleep
and
breathing
prince
andrew
was
as
glad
to
find
the
boy
like
as
if
he
had
already
lost
he
bent
over
him
as
his
sister
had
taught
tried
with
his
lips
whether
the
child
was
still
the
soft
forehead
was
prince
andrew
touched
the
head
with
his
even
the
hair
was
so
profusely
had
the
child
he
was
not
but
evidently
the
crisis
was
over
and
he
was
prince
andrew
longed
to
snatch
to
to
hold
to
his
this
helpless
little
but
dared
not
do
he
stood
over
gazing
at
his
head
and
at
the
little
arms
and
legs
which
showed
under
the
he
heard
a
rustle
behind
him
and
a
shadow
appeared
under
the
curtain
of
the
he
did
not
look
but
still
gazing
at
the
face
listened
to
his
regular
the
dark
shadow
was
princess
who
had
come
up
to
the
cot
with
noiseless
lifted
the
and
dropped
it
again
behind
prince
andrew
recognized
her
without
looking
and
held
out
his
hand
to
she
pressed
has
said
prince
was
coming
to
tell
you
the
child
moved
slightly
in
his
and
rubbed
his
forehead
against
the
prince
andrew
looked
at
his
in
the
dim
shadow
of
the
curtain
her
luminous
eyes
shone
more
brightly
than
usual
from
the
tears
of
joy
that
were
in
she
leaned
over
to
her
brother
and
kissed
slightly
catching
the
curtain
of
the
each
made
the
other
a
warning
gesture
and
stood
still
in
the
dim
light
beneath
the
curtain
as
if
not
wishing
to
leave
that
seclusion
where
they
three
were
shut
off
from
all
the
prince
andrew
was
the
first
to
move
ruffling
his
hair
against
the
muslin
of
the
this
is
the
one
thing
left
me
he
said
with
a
chapter
x
soon
after
his
admission
to
the
masonic
pierre
went
to
the
kiev
where
he
had
the
greatest
number
of
taking
with
him
full
directions
which
he
had
written
down
for
his
own
guidance
as
to
what
he
should
do
on
his
when
he
reached
kiev
he
sent
for
all
his
stewards
to
the
head
office
and
explained
to
them
his
intentions
and
he
told
them
that
steps
would
be
taken
immediately
to
free
his
that
till
then
they
were
not
to
be
overburdened
with
women
while
nursing
their
babies
were
not
to
be
sent
to
assistance
was
to
be
given
to
the
punishments
were
to
be
admonitory

the

from
this
speech
how
they

the
chief
steward
expressed
great
sympathy
with
but
remarked
that
besides
these
changes
it
would
be
necessary
to
go
into
the
general
state
of
affairs
which
was
far
from
despite
count
enormous
since
he
had
come
into
an
income
which
was
said
to
amount
to
five
hundred
thousand
rubles
a
pierre
felt
himself
far
poorer
than
when
his
father
had
made
him
an
allowance
of
ten
thousand
he
had
a
dim
perception
of
the
following
about

in
payments
on
all
the
estates
to
the
land
about
went
for
the
upkeep
of
the
estate
near
the
town
and
the
allowance
to
the
three
about
was
given
in
pensions
and
the
same
amount
for
alimony
was
sent
to
the
about
went
for
interest
on
the
building
of
a
new
previously
had
cost
about
in
each
of
the
last
two
and
he
did
not
know
how
the
about
was
and
almost
every
year
he
was
obliged
to
besides
this
the
chief
steward
wrote
every
year
telling
him
of
fires
and
bad
or
of
the
necessity
of
rebuilding
factories
and
so
the
first
task
pierre
had
to
face
was
one
for
which
he
had
very
little
aptitude
or
he
discussed
estate
affairs
every
day
with
his
chief
but
he
felt
that
this
did
not
forward
matters
at
he
felt
that
these
consultations
were
detached
from
real
affairs
and
did
not
link
up
with
them
or
make
them
on
the
one
the
chief
steward
put
the
state
of
things
to
him
in
the
very
worst
pointing
out
the
necessity
of
paying
off
the
debts
and
undertaking
new
activities
with
serf
to
which
pierre
did
not
on
the
other
pierre
demanded
that
steps
should
be
taken
to
liberate
the
which
the
steward
met
by
showing
the
necessity
of
first
paying
off
the
loans
from
the
land
and
the
consequent
impossibility
of
a
speedy
the
steward
did
not
say
it
was
quite
but
suggested
selling
the
forests
in
the
province
of
the
land
lower
down
the
and
the
crimean
in
order
to
make
it
all
of
which
operations
according
to
him
were
connected
with
such
complicated
removal
of
and
so
that
pierre
became
quite
bewildered
and
only
do
pierre
had
none
of
the
practical
persistence
that
would
have
enabled
him
to
attend
to
the
business
himself
and
so
he
disliked
it
and
only
tried
to
pretend
to
the
steward
that
he
was
attending
to
the
steward
for
his
part
tried
to
pretend
to
the
count
that
he
considered
these
consultations
very
valuable
for
the
proprietor
and
troublesome
to
in
kiev
pierre
found
some
people
he
and
strangers
hastened
to
make
his
acquaintance
and
joyfully
welcomed
the
rich
the
largest
landowner
of
the
temptations
to
greatest
the
one
to
which
he
had
confessed
when
admitted
to
the
so
strong
that
he
could
not
resist
again
whole
and
months
of
his
life
passed
in
as
great
a
rush
and
were
as
much
occupied
with
evening
and
giving
him
no
time
for
as
in
instead
of
the
new
life
he
had
hoped
to
lead
he
still
lived
the
old
only
in
new
of
the
three
precepts
of
freemasonry
pierre
realized
that
he
did
not
fulfill
the
one
which
enjoined
every
mason
to
set
an
example
of
moral
and
that
of
the
seven
virtues
he
lacked
and
the
love
of
he
consoled
himself
with
the
thought
that
he
fulfilled
another
of
the
of
reforming
the
human
had
other
of
his
and
especially
in
the
spring
of
1807
he
decided
to
return
to
on
the
way
he
intended
to
visit
all
his
estates
and
see
for
himself
how
far
his
orders
had
been
carried
out
and
in
what
state
were
the
serfs
whom
god
had
entrusted
to
his
care
and
whom
he
intended
to
the
chief
who
considered
the
young
attempts
almost
to
to
the
and
to
the
some
continuing
to
represent
the
liberation
of
the
serfs
as
he
arranged
for
the
erection
of
large
and
all
the
estates
before
the
master
everywhere
preparations
were
made
not
for
ceremonious
welcomes
he
knew
pierre
would
not
but
for
just
such
gratefully
religious
with
offerings
of
icons
and
the
bread
and
salt
of
according
to
his
understanding
of
his
would
touch
and
delude

comfortable
rapid
traveling
in
a
vienna
and
the
solitude
of
the
all
had
a
gladdening
effect
on
the
estates
he
had
not
before
visited
were
each
more
picturesque
than
the
the
serfs
everywhere
seemed
thriving
and
touchingly
grateful
for
the
benefits
conferred
on
everywhere
were
which
though
they
embarrassed
pierre
awakened
a
joyful
feeling
in
the
depth
of
his
in
one
place
the
peasants
presented
him
with
bread
and
salt
and
an
icon
of
saint
peter
and
saint
asking
as
a
mark
of
their
gratitude
for
the
benefits
he
had
conferred
on
to
build
a
new
chantry
to
the
church
at
their
own
expense
in
honor
of
peter
and
his
patron
in
another
place
the
women
with
infants
in
arms
met
him
to
thank
him
for
releasing
them
from
hard

bearing

came
to
meet
him
surrounded
by
children
by
the
he
was
instructing
in
and
on
all
his
estates
pierre
saw
with
his
own
eyes
brick
buildings
erected
or
in
course
of
all
on
one
for
and
which
were
soon
to
be
everywhere
he
saw
the
according
to
which
the
manorial
labor
had
been
and
heard
the
touching
thanks
of
deputations
of
serfs
in
their
blue
what
pierre
did
not
know
was
that
the
place
where
they
presented
him
with
bread
and
salt
and
wished
to
build
a
chantry
in
honor
of
peter
and
paul
was
a
market
village
where
a
fair
was
held
on
and
that
the
richest
peasants
formed
the
had
begun
the
chantry
long
but
that
nine
tenths
of
the
peasants
in
that
villages
were
in
a
state
of
the
greatest
he
did
not
know
that
since
the
nursing
mothers
were
no
longer
sent
to
work
on
his
they
did
still
harder
work
on
their
own
he
did
not
know
that
the
priest
who
met
him
with
the
cross
oppressed
the
peasants
by
his
and
that
the
parents
wept
at
having
to
let
him
take
their
children
and
secured
their
release
by
heavy
he
did
not
know
that
the
brick
built
to
were
being
built
by
serfs
whose
manorial
labor
was
thus
though
lessened
on
he
did
not
know
that
where
the
steward
had
shown
him
in
the
accounts
that
the
payments
had
been
diminished
by
a
their
obligatory
manorial
work
had
been
increased
by
a
and
so
pierre
was
delighted
with
his
visit
to
his
estates
and
quite
recovered
the
philanthropic
mood
in
which
he
had
left
and
wrote
enthusiastic
letters
to
his
as
he
called
the
grand
easy
it
how
little
effort
it
to
do
so
much
thought
how
little
attention
we
pay
to
he
was
pleased
at
the
gratitude
he
but
felt
abashed
at
receiving
this
gratitude
reminded
him
of
how
much
more
he
might
do
for
these
kindly
the
chief
a
very
stupid
but
cunning
man
who
saw
perfectly
through
the
naive
and
intelligent
count
and
played
with
him
as
with
a
seeing
the
effect
these
prearranged
receptions
had
on
pressed
him
still
harder
with
proofs
of
the
impossibility
and
above
all
the
uselessness
of
freeing
the
who
were
quite
happy
as
it
pierre
in
his
secret
soul
agreed
with
the
steward
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
happier
and
that
god
only
knew
what
would
happen
to
them
when
they
were
but
he
though
on
what
he
thought
the
steward
promised
to
do
all
in
his
power
to
carry
out
the
seeing
clearly
that
not
only
would
the
count
never
be
able
to
find
out
whether
all
measures
had
been
taken
for
the
sale
of
the
land
and
forests
and
to
release
them
from
the
land
but
would
probably
never
even
inquire
and
would
never
know
that
the
newly
erected
buildings
were
standing
empty
and
that
the
serfs
continued
to
give
in
money
and
work
all
that
other

all
that

of

not

with

with

bare

at

end
of
a

stretched
along

of
a

in
reply
to
inquiries
as
to
where
the
prince
pointed
out
a
small
newly
built
lodge
close
to

a
man
who
had
looked
after

his
helped

that
the
prince
was
at
and
showed
him
into
a
clean
little

was
struck
by
the
modesty
of
the
small
though
clean
house
after
the
brilliant
surroundings
in
which
he
had
last
met
his
friend
in

quickly
entered
the

with
its
wooden
walls
redolent

would
have
gone

ran

answered
him
to
and
the
sound
was
heard
of
a
chair
being
pushed
pierre
went
with
rapid
steps
to
the
door
and
suddenly
came
face
to
face
with
prince
who
came
out
frowning
and
looking
pierre
embraced
him
and
lifting
his
spectacles
kissed
his
friend
on
the
cheek
and
looked
at
him
i
did
not
expect
i
am
very
said
prince
pierre
said
he
looked
fixedly
at
his
friend
with
he
was
struck
by
the
change
in
his
words
were
kindly
and
there
was
a
smile
on
his
lips
and
but
his
eyes
were
dull
and
lifeless
and
in
spite
of
his
evident
wish
to
do
so
he
could
not
give
them
a
joyous
and
glad
prince
andrew
had
grown
and
more
but
what
amazed
and
estranged
pierre
till
he
got
used
to
it
were
his
inertia
and
a
wrinkle
on
his
brow
indicating
prolonged
concentration
on
some
one
as
is
usually
the
case
with
people
meeting
after
a
prolonged
it
was
long
before
their
conversation
could
settle
on
they
put
questions
and
gave
brief
replies
about
things
they
knew
ought
to
be
talked
over
at
at
last
the
conversation
gradually
settled
on
some
of
the
topics
at
first
lightly
touched
their
past
plans
for
the
journeys
and
the
and
so
the
preoccupation
and
despondency
which
pierre
had
noticed
in
his
look
was
now
still
more
clearly
expressed
in
the
smile
with
which
he
listened
to
especially
when
he
spoke
with
joyful
animation
of
the
past
or
the
it
was
as
if
prince
andrew
would
have
liked
to
sympathize
with
what
pierre
was
but
could
the
latter
began
to
feel
that
it
was
in
bad
taste
to
speak
of
his
and
hopes
of
happiness
or
in
prince
he
was
ashamed
to
express
his
new
masonic
which
had
been
particularly
revived
and
strengthened
by
his
late
he
checked
fearing
to
seem
yet
he
felt
an
irresistible
desire
to
show
his
friend
as
soon
as
possible
that
he
was
now
a
quite
and
pierre
than
he
had
been
in
tell
you
how
much
i
have
lived
through
since
i
hardly
know
myself
we
have
altered
very
since
said
prince
and
what
are
your
repeated
prince
andrew
he
as
if
astonished
at
the
you
i
mean
to
settle
here
altogether
next
pierre
looked
silently
and
searchingly
into
prince
which
had
grown
much
i
meant
to
pierre
but
prince
andrew
interrupted
why
talk
of
talk
to
tell
me
about
your
travels
and
all
you
have
been
doing
on
your
pierre
began
describing
what
he
had
done
on
his
trying
as
far
as
possible
to
conceal
his
own
part
in
the
improvements
that
had
been
prince
andrew
several
times
prompted
story
of
what
he
had
been
as
though
it
were
all
an
and
he
listened
not
only
without
interest
but
even
as
if
ashamed
of
what
pierre
was
telling
pierre
felt
uncomfortable
and
even
depressed
in
his
company
and
at
last
became
tell
you
my
dear
said
prince
who
evidently
also
felt
depressed
and
constrained
with
his
am
only
bivouacking
here
and
have
just
come
to
look
i
am
going
back
to
my
sister
i
will
introduce
you
to
but
of
course
you
know
her
he
evidently
trying
to
entertain
a
visitor
with
whom
he
now
found
nothing
in
will
go
after
and
would
you
now
like
to
look
round
my
they
went
out
and
walked
about
till
talking
of
the
political
news
and
common
acquaintances
like
people
who
do
not
know
each
other
prince
andrew
spoke
with
some
animation
and
interest
only
of
the
new
homestead
he
was
constructing
and
its
but
even
while
on
the
in
the
midst
of
a
talk
explaining
the
future
arrangements
of
the
he
interrupted
this
is
not
at
all
let
us
have
and
then
set
at
conversation
turned
on
was
very
much
surprised
when
i
heard
of
said
prince
pierre
as
he
always
did
when
it
was
and
said
will
tell
you
some
time
how
it
all
but
you
know
it
is
all
and
said
prince
you
know
how
it
all
you
heard
of
the
so
you
had
to
go
through
that
thing
i
thank
god
for
is
that
i
did
not
kill
that
said
asked
prince
kill
a
vicious
dog
is
a
very
good
thing
to
kill
a
man
is
is
it
urged
prince
is
not
given
to
man
to
know
what
is
right
and
what
is
men
always
did
and
always
will
and
in
nothing
more
than
in
what
they
consider
right
and
does
harm
to
another
is
said
feeling
with
pleasure
that
for
the
first
time
since
his
arrival
prince
andrew
was
had
begun
to
and
wanted
to
express
what
had
brought
him
to
his
present
who
has
told
you
what
is
bad
for
another
he
exclaimed
all
know
what
is
bad
for
we
know
but
the
harm
i
am
conscious
of
in
myself
is
something
i
cannot
inflict
on
said
prince
growing
more
and
more
animated
and
evidently
wishing
to
express
his
new
outlook
to
he
spoke
in
only
know
two
very
real
evils
in
remorse
and
the
only
good
is
the
absence
of
those
to
live
for
myself
avoiding
those
two
evils
is
my
whole
philosophy
love
of
and
began
i
agree
with
to
live
only
so
as
not
to
do
evil
and
not
to
have
to
repent
is
not
i
lived
like
i
lived
for
myself
and
ruined
my
and
only
now
when
i
am
or
at
least
modesty
made
him
correct
live
for
only
now
have
i
understood
all
the
happiness
of
i
shall
not
agree
with
and
you
do
not
really
believe
what
you
are
prince
andrew
looked
silently
at
pierre
with
an
ironic
you
see
my
princess
get
on
with
he
you
are
right
for
he
added
after
a
short
everyone
lives
in
his
own
you
lived
for
yourself
and
say
you
nearly
ruined
your
life
and
only
found
happiness
when
you
began
living
for
i
experienced
just
the
i
lived
for
and
after
all
what
is
the
same
love
of
a
desire
to
do
something
for
a
desire
for
their
i
lived
for
and
not
but
ruined
my
and
i
have
become
calmer
since
i
began
to
live
only
for
what
do
you
mean
by
living
only
for
asked
growing
about
your
your
and
your
just
the
same
as
are
not
explained
prince
le
as
you
and
princess
mary
call
are
the
chief
source
of
all
error
and
le
kiev
peasants
to
whom
you
want
to
do
and
he
looked
at
pierre
with
a
challenging
he
evidently
wished
to
draw
him
are
replied
growing
more
and
more
error
or
evil
can
there
be
in
my
wishing
to
do
and
even
doing
a
i
did
very
little
and
did
it
very
what
evil
can
there
be
in
it
if
unfortunate
our
people
like
were
growing
up
and
dying
with
no
idea
of
god
and
truth
beyond
ceremonies
and
meaningless
prayers
and
are
now
instructed
in
a
comforting
belief
in
future
and
what
evil
and
error
are
there
in
if
people
were
dying
of
disease
without
help
while
material
assistance
could
so
easily
be
and
i
supplied
them
with
a
a
and
an
asylum
for
the
and
is
it
not
a
unquestionable
good
if
a
or
a
woman
with
a
has
no
rest
day
or
night
and
i
give
them
rest
and
said
hurrying
and
i
have
done
that
though
badly
and
to
a
small
but
i
have
done
something
toward
it
and
you
cannot
persuade
me
that
it
was
not
a
good
and
more
than
you
make
me
believe
that
you
do
not
think
so
and
the
main
thing
he
i
and
know
for
that
the
enjoyment
of
doing
this
good
is
the
only
sure
happiness
in
if
you
put
it
like
that
quite
a
different
said
prince
build
a
house
and
lay
out
a
and
you
build
the
one
and
the
other
may
serve
as
a
but
right
and
good
must
be
judged
by
one
who
knows
but
not
by
you
want
an
he
on
they
rose
from
the
table
and
sat
down
in
the
entrance
porch
which
served
as
a
argue
said
prince
talk
of
he
went
crooking
a
and
so
that
you
want
to
raise
to
a
peasant
who
passed
by
them
taking
off
his
his
animal
condition
and
awaken
in
him
spiritual
while
it
seems
to
me
that
animal
happiness
is
the
only
happiness
and
that
is
just
what
you
want
to
deprive
him
i
envy
but
you
want
to
make
him
what
i
without
giving
him
my
then
you
his
but
as
i
see
physical
labor
is
as
essential
to
as
much
a
condition
of
his
as
mental
activity
is
to
you
or
you
help
i
go
to
bed
after
two
in
the
thoughts
come
and
i
sleep
but
toss
about
till
because
i
think
and
help
just
as
he
help
plowing
and
if
he
he
would
go
to
the
drink
shop
or
fall
just
as
i
could
not
stand
his
terrible
physical
labor
but
should
die
of
it
in
a
so
he
could
not
stand
my
physical
but
would
grow
fat
and
the
third
else
was
it
you
talked
and
prince
andrew
crooked
a
third
he
has
a
he
is
and
you
come
and
bleed
him
and
patch
him
he
will
drag
about
as
a
a
burden
to
for
another
ten
it
would
be
far
easier
and
simpler
for
him
to
others
are
being
born
and
there
are
plenty
of
them
as
it
it
would
be
different
if
you
grudged
losing
a
how
i
regard
you
want
to
cure
him
from
love
of
and
he
does
not
want
and
what
a
notion
that
medicine
ever
cured
killed
said
frowning
angrily
and
turning
away
from
prince
andrew
expressed
his
ideas
so
clearly
and
distinctly
that
it
was
evident
he
had
reflected
on
this
subject
more
than
and
he
spoke
readily
and
rapidly
like
a
man
who
has
not
talked
for
a
long
his
glance
became
more
animated
as
his
conclusions
became
more
that
is
said
understand
how
one
can
live
with
such
i
had
such
moments
myself
not
long
in
moscow
and
when
but
at
such
times
i
collapsed
so
that
i
live
at
seems
hateful
to
myself
most
of
then
i
and
how
is
it
with
not
that
is
not
said
prince
the
contrary
one
must
try
to
make
life
as
pleasant
as
that
is
not
my
so
i
must
live
out
my
life
as
best
i
can
without
hurting
with
such
ideas
what
motive
have
you
for
one
would
sit
without
undertaking
as
it
is
leaves
one
no
i
should
be
thankful
to
do
but
here
on
the
one
hand
the
local
nobility
have
done
me
the
honor
to
choose
me
to
be
their
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
get
out
of
they
could
not
understand
that
i
have
not
the
necessary
qualifications
for
kind
of
fussy
shallowness
necessary
for
the
then
this
which
must
be
built
in
order
to
have
a
nook
of
own
in
which
to
be
and
now
this
you
serving
in
the
said
prince
andrew
thank
you
very
i
have
promised
myself
not
to
serve
again
in
the
active
russian
and
i
even
if
bonaparte
were
here
at
smolensk
threatening
bald
then
i
serve
in
the
russian
as
i
was
he
recovering
his
this
my
father
is
chief
in
command
of
the
third
and
my
only
way
of
avoiding
active
service
is
to
serve
under
you
are
he
paused
a
little
why
do
you
for
this
my
father
is
one
of
the
most
remarkable
men
of
his
but
he
is
growing
and
though
not
exactly
cruel
he
has
too
energetic
a
he
is
so
accustomed
to
unlimited
power
that
he
is
and
now
he
has
this
authority
of
a
of
the
granted
by
the
if
i
had
been
two
hours
late
a
fortnight
ago
he
would
have
had
a
clerk
at
yukhnovna
said
prince
andrew
with
a
i
am
serving
because
i
alone
have
any
influence
with
my
and
now
and
then
can
save
him
from
actions
which
would
torment
him
there
you
but
it
is
not
as
you
prince
andrew
did
and
do
in
the
least
care
about
that
scoundrel
of
a
clerk
who
had
stolen
some
boots
from
the
i
should
even
have
been
very
glad
to
see
him
but
i
was
sorry
for
my
again
is
for
prince
andrew
grew
more
and
more
his
eyes
glittered
feverishly
while
he
tried
to
prove
to
pierre
that
in
his
actions
there
was
no
desire
to
do
good
to
his
you
wish
to
liberate
your
he
is
a
very
good
but
not
for
suppose
you
ever
had
anyone
flogged
or
sent
to
still
less
for
your
if
they
are
or
sent
to
i
suppose
they
are
any
the
worse
in
siberia
they
lead
the
same
animal
and
the
stripes
on
their
bodies
and
they
are
happy
as
but
it
is
a
good
thing
for
proprietors
who
perish
bring
remorse
upon
stifle
this
remorse
and
grow
as
a
result
of
being
able
to
inflict
punishments
justly
and
it
is
those
people
i
and
for
their
sake
i
should
like
to
liberate
the
you
may
not
have
but
i
have
how
good
men
brought
up
in
those
traditions
of
unlimited
in
time
when
they
grow
more
become
cruel
and
are
conscious
of
but
cannot
restrain
themselves
and
grow
more
and
more
prince
andrew
spoke
so
earnestly
that
pierre
could
not
help
thinking
that
these
thoughts
had
been
suggested
to
prince
andrew
by
his
he
did
not
what
sorry
peace
of
and
not
the
backs
and
beat
and
shave
as
you
always
remain
the
same
backs
and
a
thousand
times
i
shall
never
agree
with
said
chapter
xii
in
the
evening
andrew
and
pierre
got
into
the
open
carriage
and
drove
to
bald
prince
glancing
at
broke
the
silence
now
and
then
with
remarks
which
showed
that
he
was
in
a
good
pointing
to
the
he
spoke
of
the
improvements
he
was
making
in
his
pierre
remained
gloomily
answering
in
monosyllables
and
apparently
immersed
in
his
own
he
was
thinking
that
prince
andrew
was
had
gone
did
not
see
the
true
and
that
ought
to
and
raise
but
as
soon
as
he
thought
of
what
he
should
he
felt
that
prince
andrew
with
one
one
would
upset
all
his
and
he
shrank
from
afraid
of
exposing
to
possible
ridicule
what
to
him
was
precious
and
but
why
do
you
think
pierre
suddenly
lowering
his
head
and
looking
like
a
bull
about
to
do
you
think
you
should
not
think
what
asked
prince
andrew
with
about
it
be
i
myself
thought
like
and
do
you
know
what
saved
freemasonry
is
not
a
religious
ceremonial
as
i
thought
it
freemasonry
is
the
best
expression
of
the
the
aspects
of
and
he
began
to
explain
freemasonry
as
he
understood
it
to
prince
he
said
that
freemasonry
is
the
teaching
of
christianity
freed
from
the
bonds
of
state
and
a
teaching
of
and
our
holy
brotherhood
has
the
real
meaning
of
all
the
rest
is
a
said
my
dear
that
outside
this
union
all
is
filled
with
deceit
and
falsehood
and
i
agree
with
you
that
nothing
is
left
for
an
intelligent
and
good
man
but
to
live
out
his
like
merely
trying
not
to
harm
but
make
our
fundamental
convictions
your
join
our
give
yourself
up
to
let
yourself
be
and
you
will
at
once
feel
as
i
have
felt
a
part
of
that
vast
invisible
chain
the
beginning
of
which
is
hidden
in
said
prince
looking
straight
in
front
of
listened
in
silence
to
more
than
when
the
noise
of
the
wheels
prevented
his
catching
what
pierre
he
asked
him
to
repeat
and
by
the
peculiar
glow
that
came
into
prince
eyes
and
by
his
pierre
saw
that
his
words
were
not
in
vain
and
that
prince
andrew
would
not
interrupt
him
or
laugh
at
what
he
they
reached
a
river
that
had
overflowed
its
banks
and
which
they
had
to
cross
by
while
the
carriage
and
horses
were
being
placed
on
they
also
stepped
on
the
prince
leaning
his
arms
on
the
raft
gazed
silently
at
the
flooding
waters
glittering
in
the
setting
what
do
you
think
about
pierre
are
you
do
i
think
about
i
am
listening
to
all
very
you
join
our
brotherhood
and
we
will
show
you
the
aim
of
the
destiny
of
and
the
laws
which
govern
the
but
who
are
how
is
it
you
know
why
do
i
alone
not
see
what
you
you
see
a
reign
of
goodness
and
truth
on
but
i
see
pierre
interrupted
you
believe
in
a
future
he
future
prince
andrew
but
giving
him
no
time
to
took
the
repetition
for
a
the
more
readily
as
he
knew
prince
former
atheistic
say
you
see
a
reign
of
goodness
and
truth
on
nor
could
and
it
cannot
be
seen
if
one
looks
on
our
life
here
as
the
end
of
on
here
on
this
pointed
to
the
is
no
all
is
false
and
but
in
the
in
the
whole
universe
there
is
a
kingdom
of
and
we
who
are
now
the
children
of
earth
of
the
whole
i
feel
in
my
soul
that
i
am
part
of
this
vast
harmonious
i
feel
that
i
form
one
one
between
the
lower
and
higher
in
this
vast
harmonious
multitude
of
beings
in
whom
the
supreme
power
if
you
prefer
the
if
i
clearly
that
ladder
leading
from
plant
to
why
should
i
suppose
it
breaks
off
at
me
and
does
not
go
farther
and
i
feel
that
i
cannot
since
nothing
vanishes
in
this
but
that
i
shall
always
exist
and
always
have
i
feel
that
beyond
me
and
above
me
there
are
and
that
in
this
world
there
is
that
is
said
prince
it
is
not
that
which
can
convince
dear
and
death
are
what
what
convinces
is
when
one
sees
a
being
dear
to
bound
up
with
own
before
whom
one
was
to
blame
and
had
hoped
to
make
it
voice
trembled
and
he
turned
suddenly
that
being
is
seized
with
and
ceases
to
it
cannot
be
that
there
is
no
and
i
believe
there
what
that
is
what
has
convinced
said
prince
of
said
that
what
all
i
say
is
that
it
is
not
argument
that
convinces
me
of
the
necessity
of
a
future
but
when
you
go
hand
in
hand
with
someone
and
all
at
once
that
person
vanishes
into
and
you
yourself
are
left
facing
that
and
look
and
i
have
looked
it
you
know
that
there
is
a
there
and
there
is
a
there
is
the
future
the
someone
prince
andrew
did
not
the
carriage
and
horses
had
long
since
been
taken
onto
the
farther
and
the
sun
had
sunk
half
below
the
horizon
and
an
evening
frost
was
starring
the
puddles
near
the
but
pierre
and
to
the
astonishment
of
the
and
still
stood
on
the
raft
and
there
is
a
god
and
future
there
is
truth
and
and
highest
happiness
consists
in
striving
to
attain
we
must
we
must
and
we
must
believe
that
we
live
not
only
today
on
this
scrap
of
but
have
lived
and
shall
live
in
the
said
and
he
pointed
to
the
prince
andrew
stood
leaning
on
the
railing
of
the
raft
listening
to
and
he
gazed
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
red
reflection
of
the
sun
gleaming
on
the
blue
there
was
perfect
pierre
became
the
raft
had
long
since
stopped
and
only
the
waves
of
the
current
beat
softly
against
it
prince
andrew
felt
as
if
the
sound
of
the
waves
kept
up
a
refrain
to
is
believe
he
and
glanced
with
a
tender
look
at
flushed
and
but
yet
shy
before
his
superior
if
it
only
were
said
prince
it
is
time
to
get
he
stepping
off
the
he
looked
up
at
the
sky
to
which
pierre
had
and
for
the
first
time
since
austerlitz
saw
that
everlasting
sky
he
had
seen
while
lying
on
that
and
something
that
had
long
been
something
that
was
best
within
suddenly
joyful
and
in
his
it
vanished
as
soon
as
he
returned
to
the
customary
conditions
of
his
but
he
knew
that
this
feeling
which
he
did
not
know
how
to
develop
existed
within
his
meeting
with
pierre
formed
an
epoch
in
prince
though
outwardly
he
continued
to
live
in
the
same
old
inwardly
he
began
a
new
chapter
xiii
it
was
getting
dusk
when
prince
andrew
and
pierre
drove
up
to
the
front
entrance
of
the
house
at
bald
as
they
approached
the
prince
andrew
with
a
smile
drew
attention
to
a
commotion
going
on
at
the
back
a
bent
with
with
a
wallet
on
her
and
a
young
man
in
a
black
garment
had
rushed
back
to
the
gate
on
seeing
the
carriage
driving
two
women
ran
out
after
and
all
looking
round
at
the
ran
in
dismay
up
the
steps
of
the
back
are
said
prince
have
mistaken
us
for
my
this
is
the
one
matter
in
which
she
disobeys
he
orders
these
pilgrims
to
be
driven
but
she
receives
what
are
asked
prince
andrew
had
no
time
to
the
servants
came
out
to
meet
and
he
asked
where
the
old
prince
was
and
whether
he
was
expected
back
the
old
prince
had
gone
to
the
town
and
was
expected
back
any
prince
andrew
led
pierre
to
his
own
which
were
always
kept
in
perfect
order
and
readiness
for
him
in
his
he
himself
went
to
the
us
go
and
see
my
he
said
to
pierre
when
he
have
not
found
her
she
is
hiding
sitting
with
her
it
will
serve
her
she
will
be
but
you
will
see
her
really
very
are
asked
and
see
for
princess
mary
really
was
disconcerted
and
red
patches
came
on
her
face
when
they
went
in
her
snug
with
lamps
burning
before
the
icon
a
young
lad
with
a
long
nose
and
long
wearing
a
sat
on
the
sofa
beside
behind
a
near
in
an
sat
a
old
with
a
meek
expression
on
her
childlike
why
you
warn
said
the
with
mild
as
she
stood
before
her
pilgrims
like
a
hen
before
her
de
vous
je
suis
tres
contente
de
vous
she
said
to
pierre
as
he
kissed
her
she

now
at
that

appeased
being
encouraged
to
gave
a
long
account
of
father
who
led
so
holy
a
life
that
his

smelled
of

how
on
her
last
visit
to

some
monks
she
knew
let
her
have
the
keys
of

and
how
taking
some
dried
bread
with
had
spent
two
days
in
the
catacombs
with
the
pray
awhile
to
ponder
then
go
on
to
sleep
a
bit
and
then
again
go

such
that

so
well

the
greatest
respect
for

you
find
she
added
not
giving
him
time
to
reply
to
her
affectionate
am
very
anxious
about
his
health
was
better
in
the
but
last
spring
his
wound
reopened
and
the
doctor
said
he
ought
to
go
away
for
a
and
i
am
also
very
much
afraid
for
him
he
has
not
a
character
like
us
women
when
we
can
weep
away
our
he
keeps
it
all
within
today
he
is
cheerful
and
in
good
but
that
is
the
effect
of
your
is
not
often
like
if
you
could
persuade
him
to
go
he
needs
and
this
quiet
regular
life
is
very
bad
for
others
notice
but
i
see
toward
ten
the
men
servants
rushed
to
the
front
hearing
the
bells
of
the
old
carriage

pierre
also
went
out
into
the
asked
the
old
noticing
pierre
as
he
got
out
of
the
very
kiss
he
having
learned
who
the
young
stranger
the
old
prince
was
in
a
good
temper
and
very
gracious
to
before
prince
coming
back
to
his
found
him
disputing
hotly
with
his
pierre
was
maintaining
that
a
time
would
come
when
there
would
be
no
more
the
old
prince
disputed
it
but
without
getting
the
blood
from
veins
and
put
in
water
then
there
will
be
no
more
old
he
but
still
he
patted
pierre
affectionately
on
the
and
then
went
up
to
the
table
where
prince
evidently
not
wishing
to
join
in
the
was
looking
over
the
papers
his
father
had
brought
from
the
old
prince
went
up
to
him
and
began
to
talk
a
count

half
his

came
to
town
and
wanted
to
invite
me
to
gave
him
a
pretty
and
look
at
my
the
old
prince
went
addressing
his
son
and
patting
pierre
on
the
fine
like
he
stirs
me
another
says
clever
things
and
one
care
to
but
this
one
talks
rubbish
yet
stirs
an
old
fellow
get
perhaps
come
and
sit
with
you
at
have
another
make
friends
with
my
little
princess
he
shouted
after
through
the
only
on
his
visit
to
bald
did
pierre
fully
realize
the
strength
and
charm
of
his
friendship
with
prince
that
charm
was
not
expressed
so
much
in
his
relations
with
him
as
with
all
his
family
and
with
the
with
the
stern
old
prince
and
the
timid
princess
though
he
had
scarcely
known
pierre
at
once
felt
like
an
old
they
were
all
fond
of
him
not
only
princess
who
had
been
won
by
his
gentleness
with
the
gave
him
her
most
radiant
but
even
the
his
grandfather
called
smiled
at
pierre
and
let
himself
be
taken
in
his
and
michael
ivanovich
and
mademoiselle
bourienne
looked
at
him
with
pleasant
smiles
when
he
talked
to
the
old
the
old
prince
came
in
to
this
was
evidently
on
and
during
the
two
days
of
the
young
visit
he
was
extremely
kind
to
him
and
told
him
to
visit
them
when
pierre
had
gone
and
the
members
of
the
household
met
they
began
to
express
their
opinions
of
him
as
people
always
do
after
a
new
acquaintance
has
but
as
seldom
no
one
said
anything
but
what
was
good
of
chapter
xv
when
returning
from
his
rostov
for
the
first
how
close
was
the
bond
that
united
him
to
denisov
and
the
whole
on
approaching
rostov
felt
as
he
had
done
when
approaching
his
home
in
when
he
saw
the
first
hussar
with
the
unbuttoned
uniform
of
his
when
he
recognized
dementyev
and
saw
the
picket
ropes
of
the
roan
when
lavrushka
gleefully
shouted
to
his
count
has
and
who
had
been
asleep
on
his
ran
all
disheveled
out
of
the
mud
hut
to
embrace
and
the
officers
collected
round
to
greet
the
new
rostov
experienced
the
same
feeling
as
when
his
his
and
his
sister
had
embraced
and
tears
of
joy
choked
him
so
that
he
could
not
the
regiment
was
also
a
and
as
unalterably
dear
and
precious
as
his
when
he
had
reported
himself
to
the
commander
of
the
regiment
and
had
been
reassigned
to
his
former
had
been
on
duty
and
had
gone
out
when
he
had
again
entered
into
all
the
little
interests
of
the
regiment
and
felt
himself
deprived
of
liberty
and
bound
in
one
unchanging
he
experienced
the
same
sense
of
of
moral
and
the
same
sense
of
being
at
home
here
in
his
own
as
he
had
felt
under
the
parental
but
here
was
none
of
all
that
turmoil
of
the
world
at
where
he
did
not
know
his
right
place
and
took
mistaken
here

no

with
whom
he
or
ought
to
have
an

was
no
possibility
of
going
there
or
not
going

there
were
not
hours
in
the
day
which
could
be
spent
in
such
a
variety
of
there
was
not
that
innumerable
crowd
of
people
of
whom
not
one
was
nearer
to
him
or
farther
from
him
than
there
were
none
of
those
uncertain
and
undefined
money
relations
with
his
and
nothing
to
recall
that
terrible
loss
to
in
the
all
was
clear
and
the
whole
world
was
divided
into
two
unequal
our
pavlograd
the
all

and
the
rest
was
no
concern
of
in
the
everything

most
of
who
was

every
four
there
was
nothing
to
think
out
or
you
had
only
to
do
nothing
that
was
considered
bad
in
the
pavlograd
regiment
when
given
an
to
do
what
was
and
definitely
all
would
be
having
once
more
entered
into
the
definite
conditions
of
this

the
joy
and
relief
a
tired
man
feels
on
lying
down
to
life
in

during
this
was
all
the
pleasanter
for
after
his
loss
to
dolokhov
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
to
console
he
could
not
forgive
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
atone
for
his
fault
by
not
as
he
had
done
but
really
and
by
being
a
perfectly
comrade
and
a
a
splendid
man
a
thing
which
seemed
so
difficult
out
in
the
but
so
possible
in
the
after
his

had
determined
to
pay
back
his
debt
to
his
parents
in
five
he
received
ten
thousand
rubles

but
now
resolved
to
take
only
two
thousand
and
leave
the

to
repay

about

found

up

the
inhabitants

nothing

the
pavlograd
regiment
had
had
only
two
men
wounded
in

had
lost
nearly
half
its
men
from
hunger
and
in
the
death
was
so
certain
that
soldiers
suffering
from
or
the
swelling
that
came
from
bad
preferred
to
remain
on
and
hardly
able
to
drag
their
legs
went
to
the
front
rather
than
to
the
when
spring
came
the
soldiers
found
a
plant
just
showing
out
of
the
ground
that
looked
like
for
some
they
called
sweet
it
was
very
but
they
wandered
about
the
fields
seeking
it
and
dug
it
out
with
their
sabers
and
ate
though
they
were
ordered
not
to
do
as
it
was
a
noxious
that
spring
a
new
disease
broke
out
among
the
a
swelling
of
the
and
which
the
doctors
attributed
to
eating
this
but
in
spite
of
all
the
soldiers
of
squadron
fed
chiefly
on
sweet
because
it
was
the
second
week
that
the
last
of
the
biscuits
were
being
doled
out
at
the
rate
of
half
a
pound
a
man
and
the
last
potatoes
received
had
sprouted
and
the
horses
also
had
been
fed
for
a
fortnight
on
straw
from
the
thatched
roofs
and
had
become
terribly
though
still
covered
with
tufts
of
felty
winter
despite
this
the
soldiers
and
officers
went
on
living
just
as
despite
their
pale
swollen
faces
and
tattered
the
hussars
formed
line
for
roll
kept
things
in
groomed
their
polished
their
brought
in
straw
from
the
thatched
roofs
in
place
of
and
sat
down
to
dine
round
the
caldrons
from
which
they
rose
up
joking
about
their
nasty
food
and
their
as
in
their
spare
they
lit
steamed
themselves
before
them
picked
out
and
baked
sprouting

told
and
listened
to
stories
of
and
or
to
legends
of
alesha
the
or
the
laborer
the
as
lived
in
twos
and
threes
in
the
ruined
the
seniors
tried
to
collect
straw
and
potatoes
in
food
for
the
the
younger
ones
occupied
themselves
as
some
playing
cards
was
plenty
of
though
there
was
no
some
with
more
innocent
such
as
quoits
and
the
general
trend
of
the
campaign
was
rarely
spoken
partly
because
nothing
certain
was
known
about
partly
because
there
was
a
vague
feeling
that
in
the
main
it
was
going
rostov
as
with
and
since
their
furlough
they
had
become
more
friendly
than
denisov
never
spoke
of
but
by
the
tender
friendship
his
commander
showed
rostov
felt
that
the
elder
luckless
love
for
natasha
played
a
part
in
strengthening
their
denisov
evidently
tried
to
expose
rostov
to
danger
as
seldom
as
and
after
an
action
greeted
his
safe
return
with
evident
on
one
of
his
foraging
in
a
deserted
and
ruined
village
to
which
he
had
come
in
search
of
rostov
found
a
family
consisting
of
an
old
pole
and
his
daughter
with
an
infant
in
they
were
half
too
weak
to
get
away
on
foot
and
had
no
means
of
obtaining
a
rostov
brought
them
to
his
placed
them
in
his
own
and
kept
them
for
some
weeks
while
the
old
man
was
one
of
his
talking
of
began
chaffing
saying
that
he
was
more
wily
than
any
of
them
and
that
it
would
not
be
a
bad
thing
if
he
introduced
to
them
the
pretty
polish
girl
he
had
rostov
took
the
joke
as
an
flared
and
said
such
unpleasant
things
to
the
officer
that
it
was
all
denisov
could
do
to
prevent
a
when
the
officer
had
gone
who
did
not
himself
know
what
relations
with
the
polish
girl
might
began
to
upbraid
him
for
his
quickness
of
and
rostov
what
you
she
is
like
a
sister
to
and
i
tell
you
how
it
offended
for
that
denisov
patted
him
on
the
shoulder
and
began
rapidly
pacing
the
room
without
looking
at
as
was
his
way
at
moments
of
deep
what
a
mad
bweed
you
wostovs
he
and
rostov
noticed
tears
in
his
chapter
xvi
in
april
the
troops
were
enlivened
by
news
of
the
but
rostov
had
no
chance
of
being
present
at
the
review
he
held
at
as
the
pavlograds
were
at
the
outposts
far
beyond
that
they
were
denisov
and
rostov
were
living
in
an
earth
dug
out
for
them
by
the
soldiers
and
roofed
with
branches
and
the
hut
was
made
in
the
following
which
had
then
come
into
a
trench

dug
three
and
a
half
feet
four
feet
eight
inches
and
eight
feet
at
one
end
of
the
steps
were
cut
out
and
these
formed
the
entrance
and
the
trench
itself
was
the
in
which
the
lucky
such
as
the
squadron
had
a
lying
on
piles
at
the
end
opposite
the
to
serve
as
a
on
each
side
of
the
the
earth
was
cut
out
to
a
breadth
of
about
two
and
a
half
and
this
did
duty
for
bedsteads
and
the
roof
was
so
constructed
that
one
could
stand
up
in
the
middle
of
the
trench
and
could
even
sit
up
on
the
beds
if
one
drew
close
to
the
who
was
living
luxuriously
because
the
soldiers
of
his
squadron
liked
had
also
a
board
in
the
roof
at
the
farther
with
a
piece
of
but
glass
in
it
for
a
when
it
was
very
embers
from
the
campfire
were
placed
on
a
bent
sheet
of
iron
on
the
steps
in
the
denisov
called
that
part
of
the
it
was
then
so
warm
that
the
of
whom
there
were
always
some
with

and
sat
in
their
shirt
in
rostov

tidied
up
the
things
on
the
table
and
in
his

glowing
from
exposure
to
the
wind
and
with
nothing
on
but
his
lay
down
on
his
putting
his
arms
under
his
he
was
pleasantly
considering
the
probability
of
being
promoted
in
a
few
days
for
his
last
reconnoitering
and
was
awaiting
who
had
gone
out
somewhere
and
with
whom
he
wanted
a
suddenly
he
heard
denisov
shouting
in
a
vibrating
voice
behind
the
evidently
much
rostov
moved
to
the
window
to
see
whom
he
was
speaking
and
saw
the
ordered

not
to

bed
and
thought

and
bustle
my
done
and
lying
he
could
hear
that
bold
orderly
of
as
well
as
the
lavrushka
was
saying
something
about
loaded
and
oxen
he
had
seen
when
he
had
gone
out
for
then
voice
was
heard
shouting
farther
and
farther
second
are
they
off
to
thought
five
minutes
denisov
came
into
the
climbed
with
muddy
boots
on
the
lit
his
furiously
scattered
his
things
took
his
leaded
buckled
on
his
and
went
out
in
answer
to
inquiry
where
he
was
he
answered
vaguely
and
crossly
that
he
had
some
god
and
our
gweat
monarch
judge
me
said
denisov
going
and
rostov
heard
the
hoofs
of
several
horses
splashing
through
the
he
did
not
even
trouble
to
find
out
where
denisov
had
having
got
warm
in
his
he
fell
asleep
and
did
not
leave
the
hut
till
toward
denisov
had
not
yet
the
weather
had
cleared
and
near
the
next
hut
two
officers
and
a
cadet
were
playing
laughing
as
they
threw
their
missiles
which
buried
themselves
in
the
soft
rostov
joined
in
the
middle
of
the
the
officers

some
wagons
approaching

rode
straight
to
the
staff
with
a
sincere
desire
to
act
on

evening

his
dugout
in
a
state
such
as
rostov
had
never
yet
seen
him
denisov
could
not
speak
and
gasped
for
when
rostov
asked
what
was
the
he
only
uttered
some
incoherent
oaths
and
threats

a
feeble
alarmed
at

bandaged
up
again
and
put
to
next
day
he
woke
calm
and
but
at
noon
the
adjutant
of
the
regiment
came
into
and
dugout
with
a
grave
and
serious
face
and
regretfully
showed
them
a
paper
addressed
to
major
denisov
from
the
regimental
commander
in
which
inquiries
were
made
about
the
adjutant
told
them
that
the
affair
was
likely
to
take
a
very
bad
that
a
had
been
and
that
in
view
of
the
severity
with
which
marauding
and
insubordination
were
now
degradation
to
the
ranks
would
be
the
best
that
could
be
hoped
the
as
represented
by
the
offended
was
after
seizing
the
major
being
went
to
the
chief
quartermaster
and
without
any
provocation
called
him
a
threatened
to
strike
and
on
being
led
out
had
rushed
into
the
office
and
given
two
officials
a
and
dislocated
the
arm
of
one
of
in
answer
to
renewed
denisov
that
he
thought
he
remembered
that
some
other
fellow
had
got
mixed
up
in
but
that
it
was
all
nonsense
and
and
he
did
not
in
the
least
fear
any
kind
of
and
that
if
those
scoundrels
dared
attack
him
he
would
give
them
an
answer
that
they
would
not
easily
denisov
spoke
contemptuously
of
the
whole
but
rostov
knew
him
too
well
not
to
detect
that
hiding
it
from
at
heart
he
feared
a
and
was
worried
over
the
which
was
evidently
taking
a
bad
every
letters
of
inquiry
and
notices
from
the
court
and
on
the
first
of
denisov
was
ordered
to
hand
the
squadron
over
to
the
next
in
seniority
and
appear
before
the
staff
of
his
division
to
explain
his
violence
at
the
commissariat
on
the
previous
day
platov
reconnoitered
with
two
cossack
regiments
and
two
squadrons
of
as
was
his
rode
out
in
front
of
the
parading
his
a
bullet
fired
by
a
french
sharpshooter
hit
him
in
the
fleshy
part
of
his
perhaps
at
another
time
denisov
would
not
have
left
the
regiment
for
so
slight
a
but
now
he
took
advantage
of
it
to
excuse
himself
from
appearing
at
the
staff
and
went
into
chapter
xvii
in
june
the
battle
of
friedland
was
in
which
the
pavlograds
did
not
take
and
after
that
an
armistice
was
who
felt
his
absence
very
having
no
news
of
him
since
he
left
and
feeling
very
anxious
about
his
wound
and
the
progress
of
his
took
advantage
of
the
armistice
to
get
leave
to
visit
denisov
in
the
hospital
was
in
a
small
prussian
town
that
had
been
twice
devastated
by
russian
and
french
because
it
was
when
it
is
so
beautiful
out
in
the
the
little
town
presented
a
particularly
dismal
appearance
with
its
broken
roofs
and
its
foul
tattered
and
the
sick
and
drunken
soldiers
wandering
the
hospital
was
in
a
brick
building
with
some
of
the
window

and
panes
broken
and

of

walking
about

directly
rostov
entered
the
door

was
enveloped
by
a
smell
of
putrefaction
and
hospital
on
the
stairs

met
a
russian
army
doctor

that

and
impatient

queried
the
in
a
tone
of
the
did

with
reddish
asked

but
rostov
bowed
himself
away
from
the
doctor
and
asked
the
assistant
to
show
him
the
blame
the
doctor
shouted
up
after
rostov
and
the
assistant
went
into
the
dark
the
smell
was
so
strong
there
that
rostov
held
his
nose
and
had
to
pause
and
collect
his
strength
before
he
could
go
a
door
opened
to
the
and
an
emaciated
sallow
man
on
barefoot
and
in
limped
out
leaning
against
the
looked
with
glittering
envious
eyes
at
those
who
were
glancing
in
at
the
rostov
saw
that
the
sick
and
wounded
were
lying
on
the
floor
on
straw
and
i
go
in
and
is
there
to
said
the
just
because
the
assistant
evidently
did
not
want
him
to
go

entered
the
the
foul
to
which
he
had
already
begun
to
get
used
in
the
was
still
stronger
it
was
a
little
more
and
one
felt
that
this
was
where
it
in
the
long
brightly
lit
up
by
the
sun
through
the
large
the
sick
and
wounded
lay
in
two
rows
with
their
heads
to
the
and
leaving
a
passage
in
the
most
of
them
were
unconscious
and
paid
no
attention
to
the
those
who
were
conscious
raised
themselves
or
lifted
their
thin
yellow
and
all
looked
intently
at
rostov
with
the
same
expression
of
of
and
envy
of
rostov
went
to
the
middle
of
the
room
and
looking
through
the
open
doors
into
the
two
adjoining
rooms
saw
the
same
thing
he
stood
looking
silently
he
had
not
at
all
expected
such
a
just
before
almost
across
the
middle
of
the
passage
on
the
bare
lay
a
sick
probably
a
cossack
to
judge
by
the
cut
of
his
the
man
lay
on
his
his
huge
arms
and
legs
his
face
was
his
eyes
were
rolled
back
so
that
only
the
whites
were
and
on
his
bare
legs
and
arms
which
were
still
the
veins
stood
out
like
he
was
knocking
the
back
of
his
head
against
the
hoarsely
uttering
some
word
which
he
kept
rostov
listened
and
made
out
the
it
was
a
rostov
glanced
looking
for
someone
who
would
put
this
man
back
in
his
place
and
bring
him
looks
after
the
sick
he
asked
the
just
then
a
commissariat
a
hospital
came
in
from
the
next
marching
and
drew
up
in
front
of
your
he
rolling
his
eyes
at
rostov
and
evidently
mistaking
him
for
one
of
the
hospital
him
to
his
place
and
give
him
some
said
pointing
to
the
your
the
soldier
replied
and
rolling
his
eyes
more
than

anything

lowering
his
and
he
was
going
but
became
aware
of
an
intense
look
fixed
on
him
on
his
and
he
close
to
the
on
an
sat
an
soldier
as
thin
as
a
with
a
stern
sallow
face
and
eyes
intently
fixed
on
the
neighbor
on
one
side
whispered
something
to
pointing
at
who
noticed
that
the
old
man
wanted
to
speak
to
he
drew
nearer
and
saw
that
the
old
man
had
only
one
leg
bent
under
the
other
had
been
amputated
above
the
his
neighbor
on
the
other
who
lay
motionless
some
distance
from
him
with
his
head
thrown
was
a
young
soldier
with
a
snub
his
pale
waxen
face
was
still
freckled
and
his
eyes
were
rolled
rostov
looked
at
the
young
soldier
and
a
cold
chill
ran
down
his
this
one

turning
to
the
how
been
your
said
the
old
his
jaw

dead

after

the
assistant

your
let

said
rostov
and
lowering
his
eyes
and
he
tried
to
pass
unnoticed
between
the
rows
of
reproachful
envious
eyes
that
were
fixed
upon
and
went
out
of
the
chapter
xviii
going
along
the
the
assistant
led
rostov
to
the
consisting
of
three
the
doors
of
which
stood
there
were
beds
in
these
rooms
and
the
sick
and
wounded
officers
were
lying
or
sitting
on
some
were
walking
about
the
rooms
in
hospital
dressing
the
first
person
rostov
met
in
the
ward
was
a
thin
little
man
with
one
who
was
walking
about
the
first
room
in
a
nightcap
and
hospital
dressing
with
a
pipe
between
his
rostov
looked
at
trying
to
remember
where
he
had
seen
him
where
met
said
the
little
you
who
gave
you
a
lift
at

and
had
a
bit
cut
you
he
went
on
with
a
pointing
to
the
empty
sleeve
of
his
dressing
for
vasili
dmitrich
my
he
when
he
heard
who
rostov
and
tushin
led
him
into
the
next
from
whence
came
sounds
of
several
laughing
can
they
or
even
live
at
all
thought
still
aware
of
that
smell
of
decomposing
flesh
that
had
been
so
strong
in
the
and
still
seeming
to
see
fixed
on
him
those
envious
looks
which
had
followed
him
out
from
both
and
the
face
of
that
young
soldier
with
eyes
rolled
denisov
lay
asleep
on
his
bed
with
his
head
under
the
though
it
was
nearly
how
are
how
are
he
called
still
in
the
same
voice
as
in
the
but
rostov
noticed
sadly
that
under
this
habitual
ease
and
animation
some
hidden
feeling
showed
itself
in
the
expression
of
face
and
the
intonations
of
his
his
though
a
slight
had
not
yet
healed
even
six
weeks
after
he
had
been
his
face
had
the
same
swollen
pallor
as
the
faces
of
the
other
hospital
but
it
was
not
this
that
struck
what
struck
him
was
that
denisov
did
not
seem
glad
to
see
and
smiled
at
him
he
did
not
ask
about
the
nor
about
the
general
state
of
and
when
rostov
spoke
of
these
matters
did
not
rostov
even
noticed
that
denisov
did
not
like
to
be
reminded
of
the
or
in
general
of
that
other
free
life
which
was
going
on
outside
the
he
seemed
to
try
to
forget
that
old
life
and
was
only
interested
in
the
affair
with
the
commissariat
on
inquiry
as
to
how
the
matter
he
at
once
produced
from
under
his
pillow
a
paper
he
had
received
from
the
commission
and
the
rough
draft
of
his
answer
to
he
became
animated
when
he
began
reading
his
paper
and
specially
drew
attention
to
the
stinging
rejoinders
he
made
to
his
his
hospital
who
had
gathered
round
fresh
arrival
from
the
world
began
to
disperse
as
soon
as
denisov
began
reading
his
rostov
noticed
by
their
faces
that
all
those
gentlemen
had
already
heard
that
story
more
than
once
and
were
tired
of
only
the

to

his

the
middle
of

what
i
say
he
turning
to
would
be
best
simply
to
petition
the
emperor

great
rewards

now
be

surely
a
pardon

be

in
a
voice
to
which
he
tried
hard
to
give
the
old
energy
and
but
which
sounded
like
an
expression
of
irritable

when

he
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
in
a
most
dejected
state
of
mind
amid
hospital

had
gathered
round
telling
them
what
he

listening
to
their

moodily
silent

the

up
by
the
in
which
without
alluding
to
the
offenses
of
the
commissariat
simply
asked
for
it
it
he
did
not

gave
a
painfully
unnatural
chapter

having
returned
to
the

and
told

to
tilsit
with
the

the
on
the
thirteenth
of
june
the
french
and
russian
emperors
arrived
in
boris
drubetskoy
had
asked
the
important
personage
on
whom
he
was
in
to
include
him
in
the
suite
appointed
for
the
stay
at

like
to

whom
hitherto
like
everyone
had
always
called

looked
at
his
general
inquiringly
and
immediately
saw
that
he
was
being
am
of
the
emperor

the
general
patted
him
on
the
with
a
will

and
took
him
to
tilsit

boris
was
among
the
few
present
at
the
niemen
on
the
day
the
two
emperors
he
saw
the
decorated
with
saw
napoleon
pass
before
the
french
guards
on
the
farther
bank
of
the
saw
the
pensive
face
of
the
emperor
alexander
as
he
sat
in
silence
in
a
tavern
on
the
bank
of
the
niemen
awaiting
saw
both
emperors
get
into
and
saw
how
the
raft
quickly
forward
to
meet
alexander
and
held
out
his
hand
to
and
how
they
both
retired
into
the
since
he
had
begun
to
move
in
the
highest
circles
boris
had
made
it
his
habit
to
watch
attentively
all
that
went
on
around
him
and
to
note
it
at
the
time
of
the
meeting
at
tilsit
he
asked
the
names
of
those
who
had
come
with
napoleon
and
about
the
uniforms
they
and
listened
attentively
to
words
spoken
by
important
at
the
moment
the
emperors
went
into
the
pavilion
he
looked
at
his
and
did
not
forget
to
look
at
it
again
when
alexander
came
the
interview
had
lasted
an
hour
and
three
he
noted
this
down
that
same
among
other
facts
he
felt
to
be
of
historic
as
the
suite
was
a
very
small
it
was
a
matter
of
great
for
a
man
who
valued
his
success
in
the
to
be
at
tilsit
on
the
occasion
of
this
interview
between
the
two
and
having
succeeded
in
boris
felt
that
henceforth
his
position
was
fully
he
had
not
only
become
but
people
had
grown
accustomed
to
him
and
accepted
twice
he
had
executed
commissions
to
the
emperor
so
that
the
latter
knew
his
and
all
those
at
far
from
him
as
at
first
when
they
considered
him
a
would
now
have
been
surprised
had
he
been

with
another

polish

a
pole
brought
up
in

and
passionately
fond
of
the
and
almost
every
day
of
the
stay
at
french
officers
of
the
guard
and
from
french
headquarters
were
dining
and
lunching
with
him
and
on
the
evening
of
the
of
count
zhilinski
arranged
a
supper
for
his
french
the
guest
of
honor
was
an
of
there
were
also
several
french
officers
of
the
and
a
page
of
a
young
lad
of
an
old
aristocratic
french
that
same
profiting
by
the
darkness
to
avoid
being
recognized
in
civilian
came
to
tilsit
and
went
to
the
lodging
occupied
by
boris
and
in
common
with
the
whole
army
from
which
he
was
far
from
having
experienced
the
change
of
feeling
toward
napoleon
and
the
from
being
foes
had
suddenly
become
had
taken
place
at
headquarters
and
in
in
the
bonaparte
and
the
french
were
still
regarded
with
mingled
feelings
of
and
only
talking
with
one
of
cossack
rostov
had
argued
that
if
napoleon
were
taken
prisoner
he
would
be
treated
not
as
a
but
as
a
quite
happening
to
meet
a
wounded
french
colonel
on
the
rostov
had
maintained
with
heat
that
peace
was
impossible
between
a
legitimate
sovereign
and
the
criminal
rostov
was
therefore
unpleasantly
struck
by
the
presence
of
french
officers
in
dressed
in
uniforms
he
had
been
accustomed
to
see
from
quite
a
different
point
of
view
from
the
outposts
of
the
as
soon
as
he
noticed
a
french
who
thrust
his
head
out
of
the
that
warlike
feeling
of
hostility
which
he
always
experienced
at
the
sight
of
the
enemy
suddenly
seized
he
stopped
at
the
threshold
and
asked
in
russian
whether
drubetskoy
lived
hearing
a
strange
voice
in
the
came
out
to
meet
an
expression
of
annoyance
showed
itself
for
a
moment
on
his
face
on
first
recognizing
very
very
glad
to
see
he
coming
toward
him
with
a
but
rostov
had
noticed
his
first
come
at
a
bad
time
i
i
should
not
have
but
i
have
he
said
i
only
wonder
how
you
managed
to
get
away
from
your
dans
un
moment
je
suis
a
he
answering
someone
who
called
a
minute
i
shall
be
at
your
see
rostov
the
look
of
annoyance
had
already
disappeared
from
having
evidently
reflected
and
decided
how
to
he
very
quietly
took
both
hands
and
led
him
into
the
next
his
looking
serenely
and
steadily
at
seemed
to
be
veiled
by
as
if
screened
by
blue
spectacles
of
so
it
seemed
to
come
as
if
you
could
come
at
a
wrong
said
and
he
led
him
into
the
room
where
the
supper
table
was
laid
and
introduced
him
to
his
explaining
that
he
was
not
a
but
an
hussar
and
an
old
friend
of
comte
capitaine
said
naming
his
rostov
looked
frowningly
at
the
bowed
and
remained
zhilinski
evidently
did
not
receive
this
new
russian
person
very
willingly
into
his
circle
and
did
not
speak
to
boris
did
not
appear
to
notice
the
constraint
the
newcomer
produced
with
the
same
pleasant
composure
and
the
same
veiled
look
in
his
eyes
with
which
he
had
met
tried
to
enliven
the
one
of
the

the
politeness
characteristic
of
his
addressed
the
obstinately
taciturn
saying
that
the
latter
had
probably
come
to
tilsit
to
see
the
i
came
on
replied
rostov
had
been
out
of
humor
from
the
moment
he
noticed
the
look
of
dissatisfaction
on
and
as
always
happens
to
those
in
a
bad
it
seemed
to
him
that
everyone
regarded
him
with
aversion
and
that
he
was
in
he
really
was
in
their
for
he
alone
took
no
part
in
the
conversation
which
again
became
the
looks
the
visitors
cast
on
him
seemed
to
what
is
he
sitting
here
he
rose
and
went
up
to
in
your
he
said
in
a
low
and
talk
over
my
business
and
go
not
at
said
if
you
are
come
and
lie
down
in
my
room
and
have
a
they
went
into
the
little
room
where
boris
without
sitting
began
at
irritably
if
boris
were
to
blame
in
some
telling
him
about
asking
him
through
his
he
could
and
would
intercede
with
the
emperor
on
behalf
and
get
petition
handed
when
he
and
boris
were
rostov
felt
for
the
first
time
that
he
could
not
look
boris
in
the
face
without
a
sense
of
with
one
leg
crossed
over
the
other
and
stroking
his
left
hand
with
the
slender
fingers
of
his
listened
to
rostov
as
a
general
listens
to
the
report
of
a
now
looking
aside
and
now
gazing
straight
into
eyes
with
the
same
veiled
each
time
this
happened
rostov
felt
uncomfortable
and
cast
down
his
have
heard
of
such
cases
and
know
that
his
majesty
is
very
severe
in
such
i
think
it
would
be
best
not
to
bring
it
before
the
but
to
apply
to
the
commander
of
the
but
in
i
you
want
to
do
well

rostov
almost
not
looking

do

only
i
at
that
moment
voice
was
heard
calling

and
refusing
supper
and
remaining
alone
in
the
little
he
walked
up
and
down
for
a
long
hearing
the
lighthearted
french
conversation
from
the
next
chapter
xx
rostov
had
come
to
tilsit
the
day
least
suitable
for
a
petition
on
he
could
not
himself
go
to
the
general
in
attendance
as
he
was
in
mufti
and
had
come
to
tilsit
without
permission
to
do
and
even
had
he
wished
could
not
have
done
so
on
the
following
on
that
june
the
preliminaries
of
peace
were
the
emperors
exchanged
alexander
received
the
cross
of
the
legion
of
honor
and
napoleon
the
order
of
andrew
of
the
first
and
a
dinner
had
been
arranged
for
the
given
by
a
battalion
of
the
french
guards
to
the
preobrazhensk
the
emperors
were
to
be
present
at
that
rostov
felt
so
ill
at
ease
and
uncomfortable
with
boris
when
the
latter
looked
in
after
he
pretended
to
be
and
early
next
morning
went
avoiding
in
his
civilian
clothes
and
a
round
he
wandered
about
the
staring
at
the
french
and
their
uniforms
and
at
the
streets
and
houses
where
the
russian
and
french
emperors
were
in
a
square
he
saw
tables
being
set
up
and
preparations
made
for
the
he
saw
the
russian
and
french
colors
draped
from
side
to
side
of
the
with
huge
monograms
a
and
in
the
windows
of
the
houses
also
flags
and
bunting
were
want
to
help
me
and
i
want
to
ask
thought
is
over
between
but
i
leave
here
without
having
done
all
i
can
for
denisov
and
certainly
not
without
getting
his
letter
to
the
the
he
is
thought
who
had
unconsciously
returned
to
the
house
where
alexander
saddled
horses
were
standing
before
the
house
and
the
suite
were
evidently
preparing
for
the
emperor
to
come
may
see
him
at
any
thought
only
i
were
to
hand
the
letter
direct
to
him
and
tell
him
could
they
really
arrest
me
for
my
civilian
surely
he
would
understand
on
whose
side
justice
he
understands
knows
who
can
be
more
more
magnanimous
than
and
even
if
they
did
arrest
me
for
being
what
would
it
thought
looking
at

rostov
grew
frightened
at
what
he
was
the
thought
of
meeting
the
emperor

any
moment
was
so
fascinating
and
consequently
so
alarming
that
he
was
ready
to
run
but
the
official
who
had
questioned
him
opened
the
and
rostov
a
short
stout
man
of
about
in
white
breeches
and
high
boots
and
a
batiste

only
just
put
standing
in

a
new
pair
of

he
continued
to
put
on
the
uniform
the
valet
handed
rostov
went
back
into
the
hall
and
noticed
that
in
the
porch
there
were
many
officers
and
generals
in
full
parade
whom
he
had
to
cursing
his
his
heart
sinking
at
the
thought
of
finding
himself
at
any
moment
face
to
face
with
the
emperor
and
being
put
to
shame
and
arrested

his
fully
alive
now
to
the
impropriety
of
his
conduct
and
repenting
of

downcast
was
making
his
way
out
of
the
house
through
the
brilliant
suite
when
a
familiar
voice
called
him
and
a
hand
detained

doing
in

asked
a
deep
it
was
a
cavalry

obtained
the
special

seeing
the
jocular
face
of
the

took
him
aside
and
in
an
excited
voice
told
him
the
whole
asking
him
to
intercede
for

the
general
having
heard
rostov
to
the

shook
his
head
sorry
for
that
fine

rostov
handed
him

the
jingling
of

danger
of

rostov
went
close
to
the
together
with
some
inquisitive
and
after
two
saw
those
features

that

face
and

look
and
and
the
same
union
of
majesty
and
and
the
feeling
of
enthusiasm
and
love
for
his
sovereign
rose
again
in
soul
in
all
its
old

rostov
saw
the
general
talking
for
some
time
to
the
the
emperor
said
a
few
words
to
him
and
took
a
step
toward

again
the
crowd
of
members
of

was
moved
nearer
to
the
stopping
beside

he
raised
his
foot
to

the

bowed
his
head
and
the
monarch
mounted
and
rode
down
the
street
at
a
beside
himself
with
rostov
ran
after
him
with
the
chapter
xxi
the
emperor
rode
to
the
square
facing
one
a
battalion
of
the
preobrazhensk
regiment
stood
on
the

and
a
battalion
of
the
french
guards
in
their
bearskin
caps
on
the
as
the
tsar
rode
up
to
one
flank
of
the
which
presented
another
group
of
horsemen
galloped
up
to
the
opposite
and
at
the
head
of
them
rostov
recognized
it
could
be
no
one
he
came
at
a
wearing
a
small
a
blue
uniform
open
over
a
white
and
the

was
riding

fine
thoroughbred
gray
arab
horse
with
a
crimson
on
approaching
alexander
he
raised
his
and
as
he
did
with
his
could
not
help
noticing
that
napoleon
did
not
sit
well
or
firmly
in
the
the
battalions
shouted
and
napoleon
said
something
to
and
both
emperors
dismounted
and
took
each
face
wore
an
unpleasant
and
artificial
alexander
was
saying
something
affable
to
in
spite
of
the
trampling
of
the
french
which
were
pushing
back
the
rostov
kept
his
eyes
on
every
movement
of
alexander
and
it
struck
him
as
a
surprise
that
alexander
treated
bonaparte
as
an
equal
and
that
the
latter
was
quite
at
ease
with
the
as
if
such
relations
with
an
emperor
were
an
everyday
matter
to
alexander
and
with
the
long
train
of
their
approached
the
right
flank
of
the
preobrazhensk
battalion
and
came
straight
up
to
the
crowd
standing
the
crowd
unexpectedly
found
itself
so
close
to
the
emperors
that
standing
in
the
front
was
afraid
he
might
be

ask
your
permission
to
present
the
legion
of
honor
to
the
bravest
of
your

a
precise
articulating
every
this
was
said
by
the
undersized
looking
up
straight
into

listened
attentively
to
what
was
said
to
him
bending

who
has
borne
himself
most
bravely
in
this

accentuating
each

with
a
composure
and
assurance
exasperating
to

ran
his
eyes
over
the
russian
ranks
drawn
up
before
who
all
presented
arms
with
their
eyes
fixed
on
their
your

allow
me
to
consult

took
a
few
hasty
steps
toward

began
taking

casting
a
sidelong
look
at
his
colonel
in
his
face
as
often
happens
to
soldiers
called
before
the
napoleon
slightly
turned
his
and
put
his
plump
little
hand
out
behind
him
as
if
to
take
the
members
of
his
guessing
at
once
what
he
moved
about
and
whispered
as
they
passed
something
from
one
to

a

had
seen
the
previous
evening
at

respectfully
over

two

the

he
approached
lazarev
rolled
his
eyes
and
persistently
gazed
at
his
own
looked
round
at
the
emperor
alexander
to
imply
that
what
he
was
now
doing
was
done
for
the
sake
of
his
and
the
small
white
hand
holding
the
order
touched

as
if
napoleon
knew
that
it
was
only
necessary
for
his
hand
to
deign
to
touch
that
breast
for
the
soldier
to
be
forever
and

from

immediately
seized
the

and
fastened
it
to

morosely
at
the
little
man
with
white
hands
who
was
doing
something
to

still
standing
motionless
presenting
looked
again
straight
into
as
if
asking
whether
he
should
stand
or
go
or
do
something
but
receiving
no

remained
for
some
time
in
that
rigid
the
emperors
remounted
and
rode

preobrazhensk
breaking
mingled
with
the
french
guards
and
sat
down
at
the
tables
prepared
for
lazarev
sat
in
the
place
of
russian
and
french
officers
embraced
congratulated
and
pressed
his
crowds
of
officers
and
civilians
drew
near
merely
to
see
a
rumble
of
russian
and
french
voices
and
laughter
filled
the
air
round
the
tables
in
the
two
officers
with
flushed
looking
cheerful
and
passed
by
think
of
the
all
on

his

came
to
see
the
preobrazhensk
on

he
noticed
rostov
standing
by
the
corner
of
a
how
we
missed
one
he
and
could
not
refrain
from
asking
what
was
the
so
strangely
dismal
and
troubled
was

i
rostov
stood
at
that
corner
for
a
long
watching
the
feast
from
a
in
his
a
painful
process
was
going
on
which
he
could
not
bring
to
a
terrible
doubts
rose
in
his
now
he
remembered
denisov
with
his
changed
his
and
the
whole
with
arms
and
legs
torn
off
and
its
dirt
and
so
vividly
did
he
recall
that
hospital
stench
of
dead
flesh
that
he
looked
round
to
see
where
the
smell
came
next
he
thought
of
that
satisfied
with
his
small
white
who
was
now
an
liked
and
respected
by
then
why
those
severed
arms
and
legs
and
those
dead
then
again
he
thought
of
lazarev
rewarded
and
denisov
punished
and
he
caught
himself
harboring
such
strange
thoughts
that
he
was
the
smell
of
the
food
the
preobrazhenskis
were
eating
and
a
sense
of
hunger
recalled
him
from
these
he
had
to
get
something
to
eat
before
going
he
went
to
a
hotel
he
had
noticed
that
there
he
found
so
many
among
them
officers
like
had
come
in
civilian
that
he
had
difficulty
in
getting
a
two
officers
of
his

finished

of

on

him
without
reaching
a

feared
to
give
way
to

could
not

of
on

of
the

grandeur
of

intimacy
between

such
that
when

a
russian
corps
crossed
the

ferry
where
he
had
talked
with
pierre
the
year
they
went
through
the
muddy
past
threshing
floors
and
green
fields
of
winter
downhill
where
snow
still
lodged
near
the
uphill
where
the
clay
had
been
liquefied
by
the
past
strips
of
stubble
land
and
bushes
touched
with
green
here
and
and
into
a
birch
forest
growing
on
both
sides
of
the
in
the
forest
it
was
almost
no
wind
could
be
the
birches
with
their
sticky
green
leaves
were
and
flowers
and
the
first
blades
of
green
grass
were
pushing
up
and
lifting
last
the
coarse
evergreen
color
of
the
small
fir
trees
scattered
here
and
there
among
the
birches
was
an
unpleasant
reminder
of
on
entering
the
forest
the
horses
began
to
snort
and
sweated
peter
the
footman
made
some
remark
to
the
the
latter
but
apparently
the
sympathy
was
not
enough
for
and
he
turned
on
the
box
toward
his
pleasant

your

said
with
a
respectful
your

talking

prince
the
i
he
thought
as
he
turned
really
everything
is
green
how
the
birches
and
cherry
and
alders
too
are
coming
but
the
oaks
show
no
sign
here
is
one
at
the
edge
of
the
road
stood
an
probably
ten
times
the
age
of
the
birches
that
formed
the
it
was
ten
times
as
thick
and
twice
as
tall
as
it
was
an
enormous
its
girth
twice
as
great
as
a
man
could
and
evidently
long
ago
some
of
its
branches
had
been
broken
off
and
its
bark
with
its
huge
ungainly
limbs
sprawling
and
its
gnarled
hands
and
it
stood
an
and
scornful
monster
among
the
smiling
birch
only
the
evergreen
firs
dotted
about
in
the
and
this
refused
to
yield
to
the
charm
of
spring
or
notice
either
the
spring
or
the
this
oak
seemed
to
you
not
weary
of
that
constantly
repeated
always
the
same
and
always
a
there
is
no
no
no
look
at
those
cramped
dead
ever
the
and
at
me
sticking
out
my
broken
and
barked
fingers
just
where
they
have
whether
from
my
back
or
my
as
they
have
grown
so
i
and
i
do
not
believe
in
your
hopes
and
your
as
he
passed
through
the
forest
prince
andrew
turned
several
times
to
look
at
that
as
if
expecting
something
from
under
the
were
flowers
and
but
it
stood
among
them
and
grim
as
the
oak
is
a
thousand
times
thought
prince
afresh
to
that
but
we
know
our
life
is
a
whole
sequence
of
new
hopeless
but
mournfully
rose
in
his
soul
in
connection
with
that
during
this
journey
as
it
considered
his
life
afresh
and
arrived
at
his
old
restful
in
its
that
it
was
not
for
him
to
begin
anything
that
he
must
live
out
his
content
to
do
no
and
not
disturbing
himself
or
desiring

ii
prince
andrew
had
to
see
the
marshal
of
the
nobility
for
the
district
in
connection
with
the
affairs
of
the
ryazan
estate
of
which
he
was
this
marshal
was
count
ilya
and
in
the
middle
of
may
prince
andrew
went
to
visit
it
was
now
hot
spring
the
whole
forest
was
already
clothed
in
it
was
dusty
and
so
hot
that
on
passing
near
water
one
longed
to
prince
depressed
and
preoccupied
with
the
business
about
which
he
had
to
speak
to
the
was
driving
up
the
avenue
in
the
grounds
of
the
house
at
he
heard
merry
girlish
cries
behind
some
trees
on
the
right
and
saw
a
group
of
girls
running
to
cross
the
path
of
his
ahead
of
the
rest
and
nearer
to
him
ran
a
remarkably
pretty
girl
in
a
yellow
chintz
with
a
white
handkerchief
on
her
head
from
under
which
loose
locks
of
hair
the
girl
was
shouting
something
seeing
that
he
was
a
ran
back
laughing
without
looking
at
he
did
not
know
he
felt
a
the
day
was
so
the
sun
so
everything
around
so
but
that
slim
pretty
girl
did
not
or
wish
to
of
his
existence
and
was
contented
and
cheerful
in
her
own
bright
and
happy
is
she
so
glad
what
is
she
thinking
not
of
the
military
regulations
or
of
the
arrangement
of
the
ryazan
of
what
is
she
why
is
she
so
prince
andrew
asked
himself

instinctive

rostov
was
living
at
otradnoe
just
as
he
had
done
in
former
that
entertaining
almost
the
whole
province
with
and
he
was
glad
to
see
prince
as
he
was
to
see
any
new
and
insisted
on
his
staying
the
during
the
dull
in
the
course
of
which
he
was
entertained
by
his
elderly
hosts
and
by
the
more
important
of
the
visitors
old
house
was
crowded
on
account
of
an
approaching
name
prince
andrew
repeatedly
glanced
at
gay
and
laughing
among
the
younger
members
of
the
and
asked
himself
each
is
she
thinking
why
is
she
so
that
alone
in
new
he
was
long
unable
to
he
read
awhile
and
then
put
out
his
but
relit
it
was
hot
in
the
the
inside
shutters
of
which
were
he
was
cross
with
the
stupid
old
man
he
called
who
had
made
him
stay
by
assuring
him
that
some
necessary
documents
had
not
yet
arrived
from
and
he
was
vexed
with
himself
for
having
he
got
up
and
went
to
the
window
to
open
as
soon
as
he
opened
the
shutters
the
as
if
it
had
long
been
watching
for
burst
into
the
he
opened
the
the
night
was
and
very
just
before
the
window
was
a
row
of
pollard
looking
black
on
one
side
and
with
a
silvery
light
on
the
beneath
the
trees
grew
some
kind
of
bushy
vegetation
with
leaves
and
stems
here
and
farther
back
beyond
the
dark
trees
a
roof
glittered
with
to
the
right
was
a
leafy
tree
with
brilliantly
white
trunk
and
and
above
it
shone
the
nearly
at
its
in
a
almost
spring
prince
andrew
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
window
ledge
and
his
eyes
rested
on
that
his
room
was
on
the
first
those
in
the
rooms
above
were
also
he
heard
female
voices
once
said
a
girlish
voice
above
him
which
prince
andrew
recognized
at
when
are
you
coming
to
replied
another
i
the
come
now
for
the
last
two
girlish
voices
sang
a
musical
end
of
some
how
now
go
to
and
an
end
of
go
to
but
i
said
the
first
coming
nearer
to
the
she
was
evidently
leaning
right
for
the
rustle
of
her
dress
and
even
her
breathing
could
be
everything
was
like
the
moon
and
its
light
and
the
prince
dared
not
for
fear
of
betraying
his
unintentional
he
again
heard
the
first
how
can
you
only
look
how
glorious
it
how
do
wake
she
said
almost
with
tears
in
her
never
was
such
a
lovely
night
sonya
made
some
reluctant
just
come
and
see
what
a
how
come
come
you
i
feel
like
sitting
down
on
my
putting
my
arms
round
my
knees
like
straining
as
tight
as
and
flying
like
fall
he
heard
the
sound
of
a
scuffle
and
disapproving
past
one
you
only
spoil
things
for
all
again
all
was
but
prince
andrew
knew
she
was
still
sitting
from
time
to
time
he
heard
a
soft
rustle
and
at
times
a
o
what
does
it
she
suddenly
bed
if
it
must
and
she
slammed
the
her
i
might
as
well
not
thought
prince
andrew
while
he
listened
to
her
for
some
reason
expecting
yet
fearing
that
she
might
say
something
about
she
is
as
if
it
were
on
thought
in
his
soul
there
suddenly
arose
such
an
unexpected
turmoil
of
youthful
thoughts
and
contrary
to
the
whole
tenor
of
his
that
unable
to
explain
his
condition
to
himself
he
lay
down
and
fell
asleep
at
chapter
iii
next
having
taken
leave
of
no
one
but
the
and
not
waiting
for
the
ladies
to
prince
andrew
set
off
for
it
was
already
the
beginning
of
june
when
on
his
return
journey
he
drove
into
the
birch
forest
where
the
gnarled
old
oak
had
made
so
strange
and
memorable
an
impression
on
in
the
forest
the
harness
bells
sounded
yet
more
muffled
than
they
had
done
six
weeks
for
now
all
was
and
and
the
young
firs
dotted
about
in
the
forest
did
not
jar
on
the
general
beauty
lending
themselves
to
the
mood
were
delicately
green
with
fluffy
young
the
whole
day
had
been
somewhere
a
storm
was
but
only
a
small
cloud
had
scattered
some
raindrops
sprinkling
the
road
and
the
sappy
the
left
side
of
the
forest
was
dark
in
the
the
right
side
glittered
in
the
wet
and
shiny
and
scarcely
swayed
by
the
everything
was
in
the
nightingales
and
their
voices
reverberated
now
now
far
here
in
this
forest
was
that
oak
with
which
i
thought
prince
where
is
he
again
gazing
at
the
left
side
of
the
and
without
recognizing
it
he
looked
with
admiration
at
the
very
oak
he
the
old
quite
spreading
out
a
canopy
of
sappy
stood
rapt
and
slightly
trembling
in
the
rays
of
the
evening
neither
gnarled
fingers
nor
old
scars
nor
old
doubts
and
sorrows
were
any
of
them
in
evidence
through
the
hard
even
where
there
were
no
leaves
had
sprouted
such
as
one
could
hardly
believe
the
old
veteran
could
have
it
is
the
same
thought
prince
and
all
at
once
he
was
seized
by
an
unreasoning
springtime
feeling
of
joy
and
all
the
best
moments
of
his
life
suddenly
rose
to
his
austerlitz
with
the
lofty
his
dead
reproachful
pierre
at
the
that
girl
thrilled
by
the
beauty
of
the
and
that
night
itself
and
the
all
this
rushed
suddenly
to
his
life
is
not
over
at
prince
andrew
suddenly
decided
finally
and
is
not
enough
for
me
to
know
what
i
have
in
must
know
and
that
young
girl
who
wanted
to
fly
away
into
the
everyone
must
know
so
that
my
life
may
not
be
lived
for
myself
alone
while
others
live
so
apart
from
but
so
that
it
may
be
reflected
in
them
and
they
and
i
may
live
in
on
reaching
home
prince
andrew
decided
to
go
to
petersburg
that
autumn
and
found
all
sorts
of
reasons
for
this
a
whole
series
of
sensible
and
logical
considerations
showing
it
to
be
essential
for
him
to
go
to
and
even
to
the
kept
springing
up
in
his
he
could
not
now
understand
how
he
could
ever
even
have
doubted
the
necessity
of
taking
an
active
share
in
just
as
a
month
before
he
had
not
understood
how
the
idea
of
leaving
the
quiet
country
could
ever
enter
his
it
now
seemed
clear
to
him
that
all
his
experience
of
life
must
be
senselessly
wasted
unless
he
applied
it
to
some
kind
of
work
and
again
played
an
active
part
in
he
did
not
even
remember
how
on
the
strength
of
similar
wretched
logical
it
had
seemed
obvious
that
he
would
be
degrading
himself
if
he
after
the
lessons
he
had
had
in
allowed
himself
to
believe
in
the
possibility
of
being
useful
and
in
the
possibility
of
happiness
or
now
reason
suggested
quite
the
after
that
journey
to
ryazan
he
found
the
country
his
former
pursuits
no
longer
interested
and
often
when
sitting
alone
in
his
study
he
got
went
to
the
and
gazed
a
long
time
at
his
own
then
he
would
turn
away
to
the
portrait
of
his
dead
who
with
hair
curled
a
la
grecque
looked
tenderly
and
gaily
at
him
out
of
the
gilt
she
did
not
now
say
those
former
terrible
words
to
but
looked
and
inquisitively
at
and
prince
crossing
his
arms
behind
long
paced
the
now
now
as
he
reflected
on
those
inexpressible
secret
as
a
which
altered
his
whole
life
and
were
connected
with
with
with
the
girl
at
the
the
and
beauty
and
and
if
anyone
came
into
his
room
at
such
moments
he
was
particularly
and
above
all
unpleasantly
princess
mary
entering
at
such
a
moment
would
nicholas
go
out
very
it
were
prince
andrew
would
reply
at
such
times
very
dryly
to
his
could
go
out
in
his
but
as
it
is
cold
he
must
wear
warm
which
were
designed
for
that
that
is
what
follows
from
the
fact
that
it
is
and
not
that
a
child
who
needs
fresh
air
should
remain
at
he
would
add
with
extreme
as
if
punishing
someone
for
those
secret
illogical
emotions
that
stirred
within
at
such
moments
princess
mary
would
think

chapter
iv
prince
andrew
arrived
in
petersburg
in
it
was
the
time
when
the
youthful
speranski
was
at
the
zenith
of
his
fame
and
his
reforms
were
being
pushed
forward
with
the
greatest
that
same
august
the
emperor
was
thrown
from
his
injured
his
and
remained
three
weeks
at
receiving
speranski
every
day
and
no
one
at
that
time
the
two
famous
decrees
were
being
prepared
that
so
agitated
court
ranks
and
introducing
examinations
to
qualify
for
the
grades
of
collegiate
assessor
and
state
and
not
merely
these
but
a
whole
state
intended
to
change
the
existing
order
of
government
in
and
from
the
council
of
state
down
to
the
district
now
those
vague
liberal
dreams
with
which
the
emperor
alexander
had
ascended
the
and
which
he
had
tried
to
put
into
effect
with
the
aid
of
his
and
he
himself
in
jest
had
called
his
comite
de
salut
taking
shape
and
being
now
all
these
men
were
replaced
by
speranski
on
the
civil
and
arakcheev
on
the
soon
after
his
arrival
prince
as
a
gentleman
of
the
presented
himself
at
court
and
at
a
the
though
he
met
him
did
not
favor
him
with
a
single
it
had
always
seemed
to
prince
andrew
before
that
he
was
antipathetic
to
the
emperor
and
that
the
latter
disliked
his
face
and
personality
and
in
the
repellent
glance
the
emperor
gave
he
now
found
further
confirmation
of
this
the
courtiers
explained
the
neglect
of
him
by
his
displeasure
at
not
having
served
since
know
myself
that
one
cannot
help
sympathies
and
thought
prince
it
will
not
do
to
present
my
proposal
for
the
reform
of
the
army
regulations
to
the
emperor
but
the
project
will
speak
for
he
mentioned
what
he
had
written
to
an
old
field
a
friend
of
his
the
field
marshal
made
an
appointment
to
see
received
him
and
promised
to
inform
the
a
few
days
later
prince
andrew
received
notice
that
he
was
to
go
to
see
the
minister
of
count
on
the
appointed
day
prince
andrew
entered
count
waiting
room
at
nine
in
the
he
did
not
know
arakcheev
had
never
seen
and
all
he
had
heard
of
him
inspired
him
with
but
little
respect
for
the
is
minister
of
a
man
trusted
by
the
and
i
need
not
concern
myself
about
his
personal
he
has
been
commissioned
to
consider
my
so
he
alone
can
get
it
thought
prince
andrew
as
he
waited
among
a
number
of
important
and
unimportant
people
in
count
waiting
during
his
chiefly
as
an
prince
andrew
had
seen
the
anterooms
of
many
important
and
the
different
types
of
such
rooms
were
well
known
to
count
anteroom
had
quite
a
special
the
faces
of
the
unimportant
people
awaiting
their
turn
for
an
audience
showed
embarrassment
and
the
faces
of
those
of
higher
rank
expressed
a
common
feeling
of
covered
by
a
mask
of
unconcern
and
ridicule
of
their
and
the
person
for
whom
they
were
some
walked
thoughtfully
up
and
others
whispered
and
prince
andrew
heard
the
nickname
and
the
will
give
it
to
us
in
reference
to
count
one
general
important
evidently
feeling
offended
at
having
to
wait
so
sat
crossing
and
uncrossing
his
legs
and
smiling
contemptuously
to
but
the
moment
the
door
opened
one
feeling
alone
appeared
on
all
that
of
prince
andrew
for
the
second
time
asked
the
adjutant
on
duty
to
take
in
his
but
received
an
ironical
look
and
was
told
that
his
turn
would
come
in
due
after
some
others
had
been
shown
in
and
out
of
the
room
by
the
adjutant
on
an
officer
who
struck
prince
andrew
by
his
humiliated
and
frightened
air
was
admitted
at
that
terrible
this
audience
lasted
a
long
then
suddenly
the
grating
sound
of
a
harsh
voice
was
heard
from
the
other
side
of
the
and
the
pale
face
and
trembling
out
and
passed
through
the

at
the

a
man
of
forty

closely
cropped
deep
scowling
brows

chapter

while
waiting
for
the
announcement
of
his
appointment
to
the

prince
andrew
looked
up
his
former
particularly
those
he
knew
to
be
in
power
and
whose
aid
he
might
in
petersburg
he
now
experienced
the
same
feeling
he
had
had
on
the
eve
of
a
when
troubled
by
anxious
curiosity
and
irresistibly
attracted
to
the
ruling
circles
where
the
on
which
the
fate
of
millions
was
being
from
the
irritation
of
the
older
the
curiosity
of
the
the
reserve
of
the
the
hurry
and
preoccupation
of
and
the
innumerable
committees
and
commissions
of
whose
existence
he
learned
every
he
felt
that
in
here
in
petersburg
a
vast
civil
conflict
was
in
the
commander
in
chief
of
which
was
a
mysterious
person
he
did
not
but
who
was
supposed
to
be
a
man
of
and
this
movement
of
reconstruction
of
which
prince
andrew
had
a
vague
and
speranski
its
chief
began
to
interest
him
so
keenly
that
the
question
of
the
army
regulations
quickly
receded
to
a
secondary
place
in
his
prince
andrew
was
most
favorably
placed
to
secure
good
reception
in
the
highest
and
most
diverse
petersburg
circles
of
the
the
reforming
party
cordially
welcomed
and
courted
in
the
first
place
because
he
was
reputed
to
be
clever
and
very
well
and
secondly
because
by
liberating
his
serfs
he
had
obtained
the
reputation
of
being
a
the
party
of
the
old
and
who
censured
the
turned
to
him
expecting
his
sympathy
in
their
disapproval
of
the
simply
because
he
was
the
son
of
his
the
feminine
society
world
welcomed
him
because
he
was
a
good
and
almost
a
with
a
halo
of
romance
on
account
of
his
supposed
death
and
the
tragic
loss
of
his
besides
this
the
general
opinion
of
all
who
had
known
him
previously
was
that
he
had
greatly
improved
during
these
last
five
having
softened
and
grown
more
lost
his
former
and
contemptuous
and
acquired
the
serenity
that

people

about

interested
in
and
wanted
to
meet
the
day
after
his
interview

told
the
count
of
his
interview
with

of

that
nickname
with
the

vague
irony

had
noticed

at
all
count
kochubey
did
not
he
took
prince
andrew
by
the
and
went
to
meet
a
fair
man
of
about
forty
with
a
large
open
forehead
and
a
long
face
of
unusual
and
peculiar
who
was
just
the
newcomer
wore
a
blue
coat
with
a
cross
suspended
from
his
neck
and
a
star
on
his
left
it
was
prince
andrew
recognized
him
at
and
felt
a
throb
within
as
happens
at
critical
moments
of
whether
it
was
from
or
he
did
not
whole
figure
was
of
a
peculiar
type
that
made
him
easily
in
the
society
in
which
prince
andrew
lived
he
had
never
seen
anyone
who
together
with
awkward
and
clumsy
gestures
possessed
such
calmness
and
he
had
never
seen
so
resolute
yet
gentle
an
expression
as
that
in
those
rather
humid
or
so
firm
a
smile
that
expressed
nor
had
he
heard
such
a
soft
above
all
he
had
never
seen
such
delicate
whiteness
of
face
or
which
were
but
very
and
such
whiteness
and
softness
prince
andrew
had
only
seen
on
the
faces
of
soldiers
who
had
been
long
in
this
was
secretary
of
reporter
to
the
emperor
and
his
companion
at
where
he
had
more
than
once
met
and
talked
with
speranski
did
not
shift
his
eyes
from
one
face
to
another
as
people
involuntarily
do
on
entering
a
large
company
and
was
in
no
hurry
to
he
spoke
with
assurance
that
he
would
be
listened
and
he
looked
only
at
the
person
with
whom
he
was
prince
andrew
followed
every
word
and
movement
with
particular
as
happens
to
some
especially
to
men
who
judge
those
near
to
them
he
always
on
meeting
anyone
especially
anyone
like
he
knew
by
to
discover
in
him
the
perfection
of
human
speranski
told
kochubey
he
was
sorry
he
had
been
unable
to
come
sooner
as
he
had
been
detained
at
the
he
did
not
say
that
the
emperor
had
kept
and
prince
andrew
noticed
this
affectation
of
when
kochubey
introduced
prince
speranski
slowly
turned
his
eyes
to
bolkonski
with
his
customary
smile
and
looked
at
him
in
am
very
glad
to
make
your
i
had
heard
of
as
everyone
he
said
after
a
kochubey
said
a
few
words
about
the
reception
arakcheev
had
given
speranski

good
friend

fully
articulating
every
word
and
if
you
like
i
can
put
you
in
touch
with
he
paused
at
the
full
hope
you
will
find
him
sympathetic
and
ready
to
operate
in
promoting
all
that
is
a
circle
soon
formed
round
and
the
old
man
who
had
talked
about
his
subordinate
pryanichnikov
addressed
a
question
to
prince
andrew
without
joining
in
the
conversation
watched
every
movement
of
this
not
long
since
an
insignificant
divinity
who
bolkonski
held
in
his
plump
white
fate
of
prince
andrew
was
struck
by
the
extraordinarily
disdainful
composure
with
which
speranski
answered
the
old
he
appeared
to
address
condescending
words
to
him
from
an
immeasurable
when
the
old
man
began
to
speak
too
speranski
smiled
and
said
he
could
not
judge
of
the
advantage
or
disadvantage
of
what
pleased
the
having
talked
for
a
little
while
in
the
general
speranski
rose
and
coming
up
to
prince
andrew
took
him
along
to
the
other
end
of
the
it
was
clear
that
he
thought
it
necessary
to
interest
himself
in
had
no
chance
to
talk
with
during
the
animated
conversation
in
which
that
venerable
gentleman
involved
he
said
with
a
mildly
contemptuous
as
if
intimating
by
that
smile
that
he
and
prince
andrew
understood
the
insignificance
of
the
people
with
whom
he
had
just
been
this
flattered
prince
have
known
of
you
for
a
long
first
from
your
action
with
regard
to
your
a
first
of
which
it
is
very
desirable
that
there
should
be
more
and
secondly
because
you
are
one
of
those
gentlemen
of
the
chamber
who
have
not
considered
themselves
offended
by
the
new
decree
concerning
the
ranks
allotted
to
which
is
causing
so
much
gossip
and
said
prince
father
did
not
wish
me
to
take
advantage
of
the
i
began
the
service
from
the
lower
a
man
of
the
last
evidently
stands
above
our
contemporaries
who
so
condemn
this
measure
which
merely
reestablishes
natural
that
these
condemnations
have
some
returned
prince
trying
to
resist
of
which
he
began
to
be
he
did
not
like
to
agree
with
him
in
everything
and
felt
a
wish
to
though
he
usually
spoke
easily
and
he
felt
a
difficulty
in
expressing
himself
now
while
talking
with
he
was
too
much
absorbed
in
observing
the
famous
of
personal
ambition
speranski
put
in
of
state
interest
to
some

the

vanished
from

was

improved

went
on
to

that

the
that

either
a
negative
concept

not

bowed
a

without
taking
and
trying
to
attract
as
little
attention
as
he
left
the
chapter
vi
during
the
first
weeks
of
his
stay
in
petersburg
prince
andrew
felt
the
whole
trend
of
thought
he
had
formed
during
his
life
of
seclusion
quite
overshadowed
by
the
trifling
cares
that
engrossed
him
in
that
on
returning
home
in
the
evening
he
would
jot
down
in
his
notebook
four
or
five
necessary
calls
or
appointments
for
certain
the
mechanism
of
the
arrangement
of
the
day
so
as
to
be
in
time
absorbed
the
greater
part
of
his
vital
he
did
did
not
even
think
or
find
time
to
but
only
and
talked
of
what
he
had
thought
while
in
the
he
sometimes
noticed
with
dissatisfaction
that
he
repeated
the
same
remark
on
the
same
day
in
different
but
he
was
so
busy
for
whole
days
together
that
he
had
no
time
to
notice
that
he
was
thinking
of
as
he
had
done
on
their
first
meeting
at
speranski
produced
a
strong
impression
on
prince
andrew
on
the
when
he
received
him
at
his
own
house
and
talked
to
him
long
and
to
bolkonski
so
many
people
appeared
contemptible
and
insignificant
and
he
so
longed
to
find
in
someone
the
living
ideal
of
that
perfection
toward
which
he
that
he
readily
believed
that
in
speranski
he
had
found
this
ideal
of
a
perfectly
rational
and
virtuous
had
speranski
sprung
from
the
same
class
as
himself
and
possessed
the
same
breeding
and
bolkonski
would
soon
have
discovered
his
unheroic
but
as
it
strange
and
logical
turn
of
mind
inspired
him
with
respect
all
the
more
because
he
did
not
quite
understand
either
because
he
appreciated
the
capacity
or
because
he
considered
it
necessary
to
win
him
to
his
showed
off
his
dispassionate
calm
reasonableness
before
prince
andrew
and
flattered
him
with
that
subtle
flattery
which
goes
hand
in
hand
with
and
consists
in
a
tacit
assumption
that
companion
is
the
only
man
besides
oneself
capable
of
understanding
the
folly
of
the
rest
of
mankind
and
the
reasonableness
and
profundity
of
own
during
their
long
conversation
on
wednesday
speranski
more
than
once
regard
everything
that
is
above
the
common
level
of
rooted
with
a
we
want
the
wolves
to
be
fed
and
the
sheep
to
be
cannot
understand
and
all
in
a
way
that
seemed
to
you
and
understand
what
they
are
and
who
we
this
first
long
conversation
with
speranski
only
strengthened
in
prince
andrew
the
feeling
he
had
experienced
toward
him
at
their
first
he
saw
in
him
a
man
of
vast
intellect
who
by
his
energy
and
persistence
had
attained
which
he
was
using
solely
for
the
welfare
of
in
prince
eyes
speranski
was
the
man
he
would
himself
have
wished
to
who
explained
all
the
facts
of
life
considered
important
only
what
was
and
was
capable
of
applying
the
standard
of
reason
to
everything
seemed
so
simple
and
clear
in
exposition
that
prince
andrew
involuntarily
agreed
with
him
about
if
he
replied
and
it
was
only
because
he
wished
to
maintain
his
independence
and
not
submit
to
opinions
everything
was
right
and
everything
was
as
it
should
only
one
thing
disconcerted
prince
this
was
mirrorlike
which
did
not
allow
one
to
penetrate
to
his
and
his
delicate
white
which
prince
andrew
involuntarily
watched
as
one
does
watch
the
hands
of
those
who
possess
this
mirrorlike
gaze
and
those
delicate
hands
irritated
prince
he
knew
not
he
was
unpleasantly
by
the
excessive
contempt
for
others
that
he
observed
in
and
by
the
diversity
of
lines
of
argument
he
used
to
support
his
he
made
use
of
every
kind
of
mental
except
and
passed
too
it
seemed
to
prince
from
one
to
now
he
would
take
up
the
position
of
a
practical
man
and
condemn
now
that
of
a
and
laugh
ironically
at
his
now
grow
severely
or
suddenly
rise
to
the
realm
of
last
resource
was
one
he
very
frequently
he
would
transfer
a
question
to
metaphysical
pass
on
to
definitions
of
and
having
deduced
the
refutation
he
would
again
descend
to
the
level
of
the
original
in
general
the
trait
of
mentality
which
struck
prince
andrew
most
was
his
absolute
and
unshakable
belief
in
the
power
and
authority
of
it
was
evident
that
the
thought
could
never
occur
to
him
which
to
prince
andrew
seemed
so
that
it
is
after
all
impossible
to
express
all
one
and
that
he
had
never
felt
the
not
all
i
think
and
believe
and
it
was
just
this
peculiarity
of
mind
that
particularly
attracted
prince
during
the
first
period
of
their
acquaintance
bolkonski
felt
a
passionate
admiration
for
him
similar
to
that
which
he
had
once
felt
for
the
fact
that
speranski
was
the
son
of
a
village
and
that
stupid
people
might
meanly
despise
him
on
account
of
his
humble
origin
in
fact
many
caused
prince
andrew
to
cherish
his
sentiment
for
him
the
and
unconsciously
to
strengthen
on
that
first
evening
bolkonski
spent
with
having
mentioned
the
commission
for
the
revision
of
the
code
of
speranski
told
him
sarcastically
that
the
commission
had
existed
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
had
cost
and
had
done
nothing
except
that
rosenkampf
had
stuck
labels
on
the
corresponding
paragraphs
of
the
different
that
is
all
the
state
has
for
the
millions
it
has
said
want
to
give
the
senate
new
juridical
but
we
have
no
that
is
why
it
is
a
sin
for
men
like
not
to
serve
in
these
prince
andrew
said
that
for
that
work
an
education
in
jurisprudence
was
needed
which
he
did
not
nobody
possesses
so
what
would
you
it
is
a
vicious
circle
from
which
we
must
break
a
way
a
week
later
prince
andrew
was
a
member
of
the
committee
on
army
regulations
he
had
not
at
all
chairman
of
a
section
of
the
committee
for
the
revision
of
the
at
request
he
took
the
first
part
of
the
civil
code
that
was
being
drawn
up
with
the
aid
of
the
code
napoleon
and
the
institutes
of

worked
at
formulating
the

on

vii
nearly
two
years
before
in
pierre
on
returning
to
petersburg
after
visiting
his
estates
had
involuntarily
found
himself
in
a
leading
position
among
the

arranged

and

and
busied
himself
uniting
various
lodges
and
acquiring

gave
money
for
the
erection
of
temples
and
supplemented
as
far
as
he
could
the
collection
of
in
regard
to
which
the
majority
of
members
were
stingy
and
he
supported
almost
singlehanded
a
poorhouse
the
order
had
founded
in
his
life
meanwhile
continued
as
with
the
same
infatuations
and
he
liked
to
dine
and
drink
and
though
he
considered
it
immoral
and
humiliating
could
not
resist
the
temptations
of
the
bachelor
circles
in
which
he
amid
the
turmoil
of
his
activities
and
pierre
at
the
end
of
a
year
began
to
feel
that
the
more
firmly
he
tried
to
rest
upon
the
more
masonic
ground
on
which
he
stood
gave
way
under

the
same
time
he
felt
that
the
deeper
the
ground
sank
under
him
the
closer
bound
he
involuntarily
became
to
the
when
he
had
joined
the
freemasons
he
had
experienced
the
feeling
of
one
who
confidently
steps
onto
the
smooth
surface
of
a
when
he
put
his
foot
down
it
sank
to
make
quite
sure
of
the
firmness
of
the

put
his
other
foot
down
and
sank
deeper
became
stuck
in
and
involuntarily
waded
in

alexeevich

not

of
late
stood
aside
from
the
affairs
of
the
petersburg
and
lived
almost
entirely
in
all
the
members
of
the
lodges
were
men
pierre
knew
in
ordinary
and
it
was
difficult
for
him
to
regard
them
merely
as
brothers
in
freemasonry
and
not
as
prince
or
ivan
vasilevich
whom
he
knew
in
society
mostly
as
weak
and
insignificant
under
the
masonic
aprons
and
insignia
he
saw
the
uniforms
and
decorations
at
which
they
aimed
in
ordinary
often
after
collecting
and
reckoning
up
twenty
to
thirty
rubles
received
for
the
most
part
in
promises
from
a
dozen
of
whom
half
were
as
well
able
to
pay
as
pierre
remembered
the
masonic
vow
in
which
each
brother
promised
to
devote
all
his
belongings
to
his
and
doubts
on
which
he
tried
not
to
dwell
arose
in
his
he
divided
the
brothers
he
knew
into
four
in
the
first
he
put
those
who
did
not
take
an
active
part
in
the
affairs
of
the
lodges
or
in
human
but
were
exclusively
occupied
with
the
mystical
science
of
the
with
questions
of
the
threefold
designation
of
the
three
primordial
and
the
meaning
of
the
square
and
all
the
various
figures
of
the
temple
of
pierre
respected
this
class
of
brothers
to
which
the
elder
ones
chiefly
pierre
joseph
alexeevich
but
he
did
not
share
their
his
heart
was
not
in
the
mystical
aspect
of
in
the
second
category
pierre
reckoned
himself
and
others
like
seeking
and
who
had
not
yet
found
in
freemasonry
a
straight
and
comprehensible
but
hoped
to
do
in
the
third
category
he
included
those
brothers
who
saw
nothing
in
freemasonry
but
the
external
forms
and
and
prized
the
strict
performance
of
these
forms
without
troubling
about
their
purport
or
such
were
willarski
and
even
the
grand
master
of
the
principal
to
the
fourth
category
also
a
great
many
brothers
particularly
those
who
had
lately
these
according
to
observations
were
men
who
had
no
belief
in
nor
desire
for
but
joined
the
freemasons
merely
to
associate
with
the
wealthy
young
brothers
who
were
influential
through
their
connections
or
and
of
whom
there
were
very
many
in
the
pierre
began
to
feel
dissatisfied
with
what
he
was
at
any
rate
as
he
saw
it
sometimes
seemed
to
him
based
merely
on
he
did
not
think
of
doubting
freemasonry
but
suspected
that
russian
masonry
had
taken
a
wrong
path
and
deviated
from
its
original
and
so
toward
the
end
of
the
year
he
went
abroad
to
be
initiated
into
the
higher
secrets
of
the
in
the
summer
of
1809
pierre
returned
to
our
freemasons
knew
from
correspondence
with
those
abroad
that
bezukhov
had
obtained
the
confidence
of
many
highly
placed
had
been
initiated
into
many
had
been
raised
to
a
higher
and
was
bringing
back
with
him
much
that
might
conduce
to
the
advantage
of
the
masonic
cause
in
the
petersburg
freemasons
all
came
to
see
tried
to
ingratiate
themselves
with
and
it
seemed
to
them
all
that
he
was
preparing
something
for
them
and
concealing
a
solemn
meeting
of
the
lodge
of
the
second
degree
was
at
which
pierre
promised
to
communicate
to
the
petersburg
brothers
what
he
had
to
deliver
to
them
from
the
highest
leaders
of
their
the
meeting
was
a
full
after
the
usual
ceremonies
pierre
rose
and
began
his
he
blushing
and
with
a
written
speech
in
his
is
not
sufficient
to
observe
our
mysteries
in
the
seclusion
of
our
must
we
are
but
we
must
pierre
raised
his
notebook
and
began
to
the
dissemination
of
pure
truth
and
to
secure
the
triumph
of
he
must
cleanse
men
from
diffuse
principles
in
harmony
with
the
spirit
of
the
undertake
the
education
of
the
unite
ourselves
in
indissoluble
bonds
with
the
wisest
boldly
yet
prudently
overcome
and
and
form
of
those
devoted
to
us
a
body
linked
together
by
unity
of
purpose
and
possessed
of
authority
and
attain
this
end
we
must
secure
a
preponderance
of
virtue
over
vice
and
must
endeavor
to
secure
that
the
honest
man
even
in
this
receive
a
lasting
reward
for
his
but
in
these
great
endeavors
we
are
gravely
hampered
by
the
political
institutions
of
what
is
to
be
done
in
these
to
favor
overthrow
repel
force
by
we
are
very
far
from
every
violent
reform
deserves
for
it
quite
fails
to
remedy
evil
while
men
remain
what
they
and
also
because
wisdom
needs
no
whole
plan
of
our
order
should
be
based
on
the
idea
of
preparing
men
of
firmness
and
virtue
bound
together
by
unity
of
at
the
punishment
of
vice
and
and
patronizing
talent
and
raising
worthy
men
from
the
dust
and
attaching
them
to
our
only
then
will
our
order
have
the
power
unobtrusively
to
bind
the
hands
of
the
protectors
of
disorder
and
to
control
them
without
their
being
aware
of
in
a
we
must
found
a
form
of
government
holding
universal
which
should
be
diffused
over
the
whole
world
without
destroying
the
bonds
of
and
beside
which
all
other
governments
can
continue
in
their
customary
course
and
do
everything
except
what
impedes
the
great
aim
of
our
which
is
to
obtain
for
virtue
the
victory
over
this
aim
was
that
of
christianity
it
taught
men
to
be
wise
and
good
and
for
their
own
benefit
to
follow
the
example
and
instruction
of
the
best
and
wisest
that
when
everything
was
plunged
in
preaching
alone
was
of
course
the
novelty
of
truth
endowed
her
with
special
but
now
we
need
much
more
powerful
it
is
now
necessary
that
governed
by
his
should
find
in
virtue
a
charm
palpable
to
those
it
is
impossible
to
eradicate
the
but
we
must
strive
to
direct
them
to
a
noble
and
it
is
therefore
necessary
that
everyone
should
be
able
to
satisfy
his
passions
within
the
limits
of
our
order
should
provide
means
to
that
soon
as
we
have
a
certain
number
of
worthy
men
in
every
each
of
them
again
training
two
others
and
all
being
closely
everything
will
be
possible
for
our
which
has
already
in
secret
accomplished
much
for
the
welfare
of
this
speech
not
only
made
a
strong
but
created
excitement
in
the
the
majority
of
the
seeing
in
it
dangerous
designs
of
met
it
with
a
coldness
that
surprised
the
grand
master
began
answering
and
pierre
began
developing
his
views
with
more
and
more
it
was
long
since
there
had
been
so
stormy
a
parties
were
some
accusing
pierre
of
others
supporting
at
that
meeting
he
was
struck
for
the
first
time
by
the
endless
variety
of
which
prevents
a
truth
from
ever
presenting
itself
identically
to
two
even
those
members
who
seemed
to
be
on
his
side
understood
him
in
their
own
way
with
limitations
and
alterations
he
could
not
agree
as
what
he
always
wanted
most
was
to
convey
his
thought
to
others
just
as
he
himself
understood
the
illuminati
sought
to
substitute
republican
for
monarchical
at
the
end
of
the
meeting
the
grand
master
with
irony
and
reproved
bezukhov
for
his
vehemence
and
said
it
was
not
love
of
virtue
but
also
a
love
of
strife
that
had
moved
him
in
the
pierre
did
not
answer
him
and
asked
briefly
whether
his
proposal
would
be
he
was
told
that
it
would
and
without
waiting
for
the
usual
formalities
he
left
the
lodge
and
went
chapter
viii
again
pierre
was
overtaken
by
the
depression
he
so
for
three
days
after
the
delivery
of
his
speech
at
the
lodge
he
lay
on
a
sofa
at
home
receiving
no
one
and
going
it
was
just
then
that
he
received
a
letter
from
his
who
implored
him
to
see
telling
him
how
grieved
she
was
about
him
and
how
she
wished
to
devote
her
whole
life
to
at
the
end
of
the
letter
she
informed
him
that
in
a
few
days
she
would
return
to
petersburg
from
following
this
letter
one
of
the
masonic
brothers
whom
pierre
respected
less
than
the
others
forced
his
way
in
to
see
him
turning
the
conversation
upon
matrimonial
by
way
of
fraternal
advice
expressed
the
opinion
that
his
severity
to
his
wife
was
wrong
and
that
he
was
neglecting
one
of
the
first
rules
of
freemasonry
by
not
forgiving
the
at
the
same
time
his
prince
sent
to
him
imploring
him
to
come
if
only
for
a
few
minutes
to
discuss
a
most
important
pierre
saw
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
against
him
and
that
they
wanted
to
reunite
him
with
his
and
in
the
mood
he
then
this
was
not
even
unpleasant
to
nothing
mattered
to
nothing
in
life
seemed
to
him
of
much
and
under
the
influence
of
the
depression
that
possessed
him
he
valued
neither
his
liberty
nor
his
resolution
to
punish
his
one
is
right
and
no
one
is
to
so
she
too
is
not
to
he
if
he
did
not
at
once
give
his
consent
to
a
reunion
with
his
it
was
only
because
in
his
state
of
depression
he
did
not
feel
able
to
take
any
had
his
wife
come
to
he
would
not
have
turned
her
compared
to
what
preoccupied
was
it
not
a
matter
of
indifference
whether
he
lived
with
his
wife
or
without
replying
either
to
his
wife
or
his
pierre
late
one
night
prepared
for
a
journey
and
started
for
moscow
to
see
joseph
this
is
what
he
noted
in
his
17th
november
i
have
just
returned
from
my
and
hasten
to
write
down
what
i
have
joseph
alexeevich
is
living
poorly
and
has
for
three
years
been
suffering
from
a
painful
disease
of
the
no
one
has
ever
heard
him
utter
a
groan
or
a
word
of
from
morning
till
late
at
except
when
he
eats
his
very
plain
he
is
working
at
he
received
me
graciously
and
made
me
sit
down
on
the
bed
on
which
he
i
made
the
sign
of
the
knights
of
the
east
and
of
and
he
responded
in
the
same
asking
me
with
a
mild
smile
what
i
had
learned
and
gained
in
the
prussian
and
scottish
i
told
him
everything
as
best
i
and
told
him
what
i
had
proposed
to
our
petersburg
of
the
bad
reception
i
had
and
of
my
rupture
with
the
joseph
having
remained
silent
and
thoughtful
for
a
good
told
me
his
view
of
the
which
at
once
lit
up
for
me
my
whole
past
and
the
future
path
i
should
he
surprised
me
by
asking
whether
i
remembered
the
threefold
aim
of
the
the
preservation
and
study
of
the
the
purification
and
reformation
of
oneself
for
its
and
the
improvement
of
the
human
race
by
striving
for
such
which
is
the
principal
aim
of
these
certainly
and
only
to
this
aim
can
we
always
strive
independently
of
but
at
the
same
time
just
this
aim
demands
the
greatest
efforts
of
and
led
astray
by
losing
sight
of
this
we
occupy
ourselves
either
with
the
mystery
which
in
our
impurity
we
are
unworthy
to
or
seek
the
reformation
of
the
human
race
while
ourselves
setting
an
example
of
baseness
and
illuminism
is
not
a
pure
just
because
it
is
attracted
by
social
activity
and
puffed
up
by
on
this
ground
joseph
alexeevich
condemned
my
speech
and
my
whole
and
in
the
depth
of
my
soul
i
agreed
with
talking
of
my
family
affairs
he
said
to
chief
duty
of
a
true
as
i
have
told
lies
in
perfecting
we
often
think
that
by
removing
all
the
difficulties
of
our
life
we
shall
more
quickly
reach
our
but
on
the
my
dear
it
is
only
in
the
midst
of
worldly
cares
that
we
can
attain
our
three
chief
man
can
only
know
himself
by
which
can
only
be
attained
by
and
the
attainment
of
the
chief
of
only
the
vicissitudes
of
life
can
show
us
its
vanity
and
develop
our
innate
love
of
death
or
of
rebirth
to
a
new
these
words
are
all
the
more
remarkable
in
spite
of
his
great
physical
joseph
alexeevich
is
never
weary
of
life
though
he
loves
for
spite
of
the
purity
and
loftiness
of
his
inner
does
not
yet
feel
himself
sufficiently
my
benefactor
then
explained
to
me
fully
the
meaning
of
the
great
square
of
creation
and
pointed
out
to
me
that
the
numbers
three
and
seven
are
the
basis
of
he
advised
me
not
to
avoid
intercourse
with
the
petersburg
but
to
take
up
only
posts
in
the
to
while
diverting
the
brothers
from
to
turn
them
toward
the
true
path
knowledge
and
besides
this
he
advised
me
for
myself
personally
above
all
to
keep
a
watch
over
and
to
that
end
he
gave
me
a
the
one
i
am
now
writing
in
and
in
which
i
will
in
future
note
down
all
my
23rd
november
i
am
again
living
with
my
my
came
to
me
in
tears
and
said
that
helene
was
here
and
that
she
implored
me
to
hear
that
she
was
innocent
and
unhappy
at
my
and
much
i
knew
that
if
i
once
let
myself
see
her
i
should
not
have
strength
to
go
on
refusing
what
she
in
my
perplexity
i
did
not
know
whose
aid
and
advice
to
had
my
benefactor
been
here
he
would
have
told
me
what
to
i
went
to
my
room
and
reread
joseph
letters
and
recalled
my
conversations
with
and
deduced
from
it
all
that
i
ought
not
to
refuse
a
and
ought
to
reach
a
helping
hand
to
especially
to
one
so
closely
bound
to
that
i
must
bear
my
but
if
i
forgive
her
for
the
sake
of
doing
then
let
union
with
her
have
only
a
spiritual
that
is
what
i
and
what
i
wrote
to
joseph
i
told
my
wife
that
i
begged
her
to
forget
the
to
forgive
me
whatever
wrong
i
may
have
done
and
that
i
had
nothing
to
it
gave
me
joy
to
tell
her
she
need
not
know
how
hard
it
was
for
me
to
see
her
i
have
settled
on
the
upper
floor
of
this
big
house
and
am
experiencing
a
happy
feeling

always
the
highest
society

met
at
court
and
at
the
grand
balls

divided
into
several

with
its
own
particular
the
largest
of
these
was
the
french
circle
of
the
napoleonic

circle
of
count

in
this
group
as
soon
as
she
had
settled
in
petersburg
with
her
took
a
very
prominent
she
was
visited
by
the
members
of
the
french

by
many
belonging
to
that

noted
for
their
intellect

polished

been

during
the
famous
meeting
of

had
brought
from
there
these
connections

her
success
had
been

had
noticed
her
in
the
theater
and
said
of
un
superbe
her
success
as
a
beautiful
and
elegant
woman
did
not
surprise
for
she
had
become
even
handsomer

that
during

two
years

sometimes
with
a
strange
feeling
of
perplexity

her
evenings
and
dinner
where
and

were
at
these

his
feelings
were
like
those
of

always
expects
his
trick
to
be
found
out
at
any

whether
because
stupidity
was

and
clever
woman

so
firmly
established
that
she
could
say
the
emptiest
and
stupidest
things
and
everybody
would
go
into
raptures
over
every
word
of
hers

look
for

profound
meaning

just
the
husband
needed
for
a
brilliant
society
he
was
that
a
grand
seigneur
husband
who
was
in
no
and
far
from
spoiling
the
high
tone
and
general
impression
of
the
drawing

by
the
contrast
he
presented
to
as
an
advantageous
background
to
his
elegant
and
tactful
pierre
during
the
last
two
as
a
result
of
his
continual
absorption
in
abstract
interests
and
his
sincere
contempt
for
all
had
acquired
in
his
which
did
not
interest
that
air
of
and
benevolence
toward
which
cannot
be
acquired
artificially
and
therefore
inspires
involuntary

entered

drawing
room
as
one

acquainted
with
equally
pleased
to
see
and
equally
indifferent
to
them
sometimes
he
joined
in
a
conversation
which
interested
him
regardless
of
whether
any
of
the
were
present
or
lispingly
expressed
his
which
were
sometimes
not
at
all
in
accord
with
the
accepted
tone
of
the
but
the
general
opinion
concerning
the
queer
husband
of
most
distinguished
woman
in
was
so
well
established
that
no
one
took
his
freaks
among
the
many
young
men
who
frequented
her
house
every

who
had
already
achieved
great
success
in

the
most
intimate
friend
of
the
bezukhov
household

return
from
helene
spoke
of
him
as
and
treated
him
like
a
her
smile
for
him
was
the
same
as
for
but
sometimes
that
smile
made
pierre
toward
him
boris
behaved
with
a
particularly
dignified
and
sad
this
shade
of
deference
also
disturbed
he
had
suffered
so
painfully
three
years
before
from
the
mortification
to
which
his
wife
had
subjected
him
that
he
now
protected
himself
from
the
danger
of
its
first
by
not
being
a
husband
to
his
and
secondly
by
not
allowing
himself
to
now
that
she
has
become
a
bluestocking
she
has
finally
renounced
her
former
he
told
has
never
been
an
instance
of
a
bluestocking
being
carried
away

affairs
of

statement
though
gathered
from
an
unknown
he
believed
yet
strange
to
say
presence
in
his
drawing
room
he
was
almost
always
had
a
physical
effect
upon
it
constricted
his
limbs
and
destroyed
the
unconsciousness
and
freedom
of
his
a
strange
thought
i
used
to
like
him
very
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
pierre
was
a
great
the
rather
blind
and
absurd
husband
of
a
distinguished
a
clever
crank
who
did
nothing
but
harmed
nobody
and
was
a
but
a
complex
and
difficult
process
of
internal
development
was
taking
place
all
this
time
in
revealing
much
to
him
and
causing
him
many
spiritual
doubts
and
chapter
x
pierre
went
on
with
his
and
this
is
what
he
wrote
in
it
during
that
24th
november

up
at

after

out
some
passages

the
evening
i
went
down
to
the
countess
and
told
a
funny
story
about

only
remembered
that
i
ought
not
to
have
done
so
when
everybody
laughed
loudly
at
i
am
going
to

with
a
happy
and
tranquil
great
help

27th
november
i
got
up
on
waking
i
lay
long
in
bed
yielding
to
o
help
and
strengthen
me
that
i
may
walk
in
thy
read
the
but
without
proper
brother
urusov
came
and
we
talked
about
worldly
he
told
me
of
the
new
i
began
to
criticize
but
remembered
my
rules
and
my
a
true
freemason
should
be
a
zealous
worker
for
the
state
when
his
aid
is
required
and
a
quiet
onlooker
when
not
called
on
to
my
tongue
is
my
brothers
and
visited
me
and
we
had
a
preliminary
talk
about
the
reception
of
a
new
they
laid
on
me
the
duty
of
i
feel
myself
weak
and
then
our
talk
turned
to
the
interpretation
of
the
seven
pillars
and
steps
of
the
the
seven
the
seven
the
seven
and
the
seven
gifts
of
the
holy
brother
was
very
in
the
evening
the
admission
took
the
new
decoration
of
the
premises
contributed
much
to
the
magnificence
of
the
it
was
boris
drubetskoy
who
was
i
nominated
him
and
was
the
a
strange
feeling
agitated
me
all
the
time
i
was
alone
with
him
in
the
dark
i
caught
myself
harboring
a
feeling
of
hatred
toward
him
which
i
vainly
tried
to
that
is
why
i
should
really
like
to
save
him
from
evil
and
lead
him
into
the
path
of
but
evil
thoughts
of
him
did
not
leave
it
seemed
to
me
that
his
object
in
entering
the
brotherhood
was
merely
to
be
intimate
and
in
favor
with
members
of
our
apart
from
the
fact
that
he
had
asked
me
several
times
whether
and
were
members
of
our
lodge
question
to
which
i
could
not
and
that
according
to
my
observation
he
is
incapable
of
feeling
respect
for
our
holy
order
and
is
too
preoccupied
and
satisfied
with
the
outer
man
to
desire
spiritual
i
had
no
cause
to
doubt
but
he
seemed
to
me
and
all
the
time
i
stood
alone
with
him
in
the
dark
temple
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
smiling
contemptuously
at
my
and
i
wished
really
to
stab
his
bare
breast
with
the
sword
i
held
to
i
could
not
be
nor
could
i
frankly
mention
my
doubts
to
the
brothers
and
to
the
grand
great
architect
of

me
to
find
the
true
path

of
the
labyrinth
of

three
pages

left
blank
in

then
the
following

had
a

and

3rd
december
awoke
read
the
scriptures
but
was
afterwards
went
and
paced
up
and
down
the
large
i
wished
to
but
instead
my
imagination
pictured
an
occurrence
of
four
years
when
meeting
me
in
moscow
after
our
said
he
hoped
i
was
enjoying
perfect
peace
of
mind
in
spite
of
my
at
the
time
i
gave
him
no
now
i
recalled
every
detail
of
that
meeting
and
in
my
mind
gave
him
the
most
malevolent
and
bitter
i
recollected
myself
and
drove
away
that
thought
only
when
i
found
myself
glowing
with
but
i
did
not
sufficiently
afterwards
boris
drubetskoy
came
and
began
relating
various
his
coming
vexed
me
from
the
and
i
said
something
disagreeable
to
he
i
flared
up
and
said
much
that
was
unpleasant
and
even
rude
to
he
became
and
i
recollected
myself
only
when
it
was
too
my
i
cannot
get
on
with
him
at
the
cause
of
this
is
my
i
set
myself
above
him
and
so
become
much
worse
than
for
he
is
lenient
to
my
rudeness
while
i
on
the
contrary
nourish
contempt
for
o
grant
that
in
his
presence
i
may
rather
see
my
own
and
behave
so
that
he
too
may
after
dinner
i
fell
asleep
and
as
i
was
drowsing
off
i
clearly
heard
a
voice
saying
in
my
left
i
dreamed
that
i
was
walking
in
the
dark
and
was
suddenly
surrounded
by
but
i
went
on
suddenly
a
smallish
dog
seized
my
left
thigh
with
its
teeth
and
would
not
let
i
began
to
throttle
it
with
my
scarcely
had
i
torn
it
off
before
a
bigger
began
biting
i
lifted
it
but
the
higher
i
lifted
it
the
bigger
and
heavier
it
and
suddenly
brother
came
taking
my
led
me
to
a
building
to
enter
which
we
had
to
pass
along
a
narrow
i
stepped
on
but
it
bent
and
gave
way
and
i
began
to
clamber
up
a
fence
which
i
could
scarcely
reach
with
my
after
much
effort
i
dragged
myself
so
that
my
leg
hung
down
on
one
side
and
my
body
on
the
i
looked
round
and
saw
brother
standing
on
the
fence
and
pointing
me
to
a
broad
avenue
and
and
in
the
garden
was
a
large
and
beautiful
i
woke
o
great
architect
of
help
me
to
tear
from
myself
these
passions
especially
the
which
unites
in
itself
the
strength
of
all
the
former
and
aid
me
to
enter
that
temple
of
virtue
to
a
vision
of
which
i
attained
in
my
7th
december
i
dreamed
that
joseph
alexeevich
was
sitting
in
my
and
that
i
was
very
glad
and
wished
to
entertain
it
seemed
as
if
i
chattered
incessantly
with
other
people
and
suddenly
remembered
that
this
could
not
please
and
i
wished
to
come
close
to
him
and
embrace
but
as
soon
as
i
drew
near
i
saw
that
his
face
had
changed
and
grown
and
he
was
quietly
telling
me
something
about
the
teaching
of
our
but
so
softly
that
i
could
not
hear
then
it
seemed
that
we
all
left
the
room
and
something
strange
we
were
sitting
or
lying
on
the
he
was
telling
me
and
i
wished
to
show
him
my
and
not
listening
to
what
he
was
saying
i
began
picturing
to
myself
the
condition
of
my
inner
man
and
the
grace
of
god
sanctifying
and
tears
came
into
my
and
i
was
glad
he
noticed
but
he
looked
at
me
with
vexation
and
jumped
breaking
off
his
i
felt
abashed
and
asked
whether
what
he
had
been
saying
did
not
concern
but
he
did
not
gave
me
a
kind
and
then
we
suddenly
found
ourselves
in
my
bedroom
where
there
is
a
double
he
lay
down
on
the
edge
of
it
and
i
burned
with
longing
to
caress
him
and
lie
down
and
he
me
frankly
what
is
your
chief
do
you
know
i
think
you
know
it
abashed
by
this
i
replied
that
sloth
was
my
chief
he
shook
his
head
and
even
more
i
said
that
though
i
was
living
with
my
wife
as
he
i
was
not
living
with
her
as
her
to
this
he
replied
that
one
should
not
deprive
a
wife
of
embraces
and
gave
me
to
understand
that
that
was
my
but
i
replied
that
i
should
be
ashamed
to
do
and
suddenly
everything
and
i
awoke
and
found
in
my
mind
the
text
from
the
life
was
the
light
of
and
the
light
shineth
in
and
the
darkness
comprehended
it
joseph
face
had
looked
young
and
that
day
i
received
a
letter
from
my
benefactor
in
which
he
wrote
about
9th
december
i
had
a
dream
from
which
i
awoke
with
a
throbbing
i
saw
that
i
was
in
moscow
in
my
in
the
big
sitting
and
joseph
alexeevich
came
in
from
the
drawing
i
seemed
to
know
at
once
that
the
process
of
regeneration
had
already
taken
place
in
and
i
rushed
to
meet
i
embraced
him
and
kissed
his
and
he
thou
noticed
that
my
face
is
i
looked
at
still
holding
him
in
my
and
saw
that
his
face
was
but
that
he
had
no
hair
on
his
head
and
his
features
were
quite
and
i
should
have
known
you
had
i
met
you
by
and
i
thought
to
i
telling
the
and
suddenly
i
saw
him
lying
like
a
dead
then
he
gradually
recovered
and
went
with
me
into
my
study
carrying
a
large
book
of
sheets
of
drawing
i
drew
and
he
answered
by
bowing
his
i
opened
the
and
on
all
the
pages
there
were
excellent
and
in
my
dream
i
knew
that
these
drawings
represented
the
love
adventures
of
the
soul
with
its
and
on
its
pages
i
saw
a
beautiful
representation
of
a
maiden
in
transparent
garments
and
with
a
transparent
flying
up
to
the
and
i
seemed
to
know
that
this
maiden
was
nothing
else
than
a
representation
of
the
song
of
and
looking
at
those
drawings
i
dreamed
i
felt
that
i
was
doing
but
could
not
tear
myself
away

thy
forsaking
me

berg
shown
everybody
his

wounded
at
austerlitz
and
held
a
perfectly
unnecessary
sword
in

he
narrated
that
episode
so
persistently
and
with
so
important
an
air
that
everyone
believed
in
the
merit
and
usefulness
of
his
and
he
had
obtained
two
decorations
for
in
the

also
managed

had
picked
up
the
scrap
of
a

that
had
killed
an
standing
near

had
taken
it
to
his
just
as
he
had
done
after
he
related
this
occurrence
at
such
length
and
so
insistently
that
everyone
again
believed
it
had
been
necessary
to
do
and
he
received
two
decorations

war

was
a

in

wore
and
held
some
special
lucrative
posts
in
though
some
skeptics
smiled
when
told
of
it
could
not
be
denied
that
he
was
a
painstaking
and
brave
on
excellent
terms
with
his
and
a
moral
young
man
with
a
brilliant
career
before
him
and
an
assured
position
in
four
years
meeting
a
german
comrade
in
the
stalls
of
a
moscow
berg
had
pointed
out
vera
rostova
to
him
and
had
said
in
soll
mein
weib
and
from
that
moment
had
made
up
his
mind
to
marry
now
in
having
considered
the
position
and
his
he
decided
that
the
time
had
come
to
girl
shall
be
my
proposal
was
at
first
received
with
a
perplexity
that
was
not
flattering
to
at
first
it
seemed
strange
that
the
son
of
an
obscure
livonian
gentleman
should
propose
marriage
to
a
countess
but
chief
characteristic
was
such
a
naive
and
good
natured
egotism
that
the
rostovs
involuntarily
came
to
think
it
would
be
a
good
since
he
himself
was
so
firmly
convinced
that
it
was
indeed
the
affairs
were
seriously
as
the
suitor
could
not
but
and
above
vera
was
had
been
taken
out
and
though
she
was
certainly
and
no
one
up
to
now
had
proposed
to
so
they
gave
their
said
berg
to
his
whom
he
called
only
because
he
knew
that
everyone
has
i
have
considered
it
and
should
not
marry
if
i
had
not
thought
it
all
out
or
if
it
were
in
any
way
but
on
the
my
papa
and
mamma
are
now
provided
have
arranged
that
rent
for
them
in
the
baltic
i
can
live
in
petersburg
on
my
and
with
her
fortune
and
my
good
management
we
can
get
along
i
am
not
marrying
for
consider
that
a
wife
should
bring
her
share
and
a
husband
i
have
my
position
in
the
she
has
connections
and
some
in
our
times
that
is
worth
but
above
she
is
a
estimable
and
she
loves
berg
blushed
and
i
love
because
her
character
is
sensible
and
very
now
the
other
though
they
are
the
same
is
quite
an
unpleasant
character
and
has
not
the
same
she
is
you
but
my
you
will
be
he
was
going
to
but
changed
his
mind
and
said
take
tea
with
and
quickly
doubling
up
his
tongue
he
blew
a
small
round
ring
of
tobacco
perfectly
embodying
his
dream
of
after
the
first
feeling
of
perplexity
aroused
in
the
parents
by
the
holiday
tone
of
joyousness
usual
at
such
times
took
possession
of
the
but
the
rejoicing
was
external
and
in
the
feeling
toward
this
wedding
a
certain
awkwardness
and
constraint
was
as
if
they
were
ashamed
of
not
having
loved
vera
sufficiently
and
of
being
so
ready
to
get
her
off
their
the
old
count
felt
this
he
would
probably
have
been
unable
to
state
the
cause
of
his
but
it
resulted
from
the
state
of
his
he
did
not
know
at
all
how
much
he
what
his
debts
amounted
or
what
dowry
he
could
give
when
his
daughters
were
born
he
had
assigned
to
each
of
for
her
an
estate
with
three
hundred
but
one
of
these
estates
had
already
been
and
the
other
was
mortgaged
and
the
interest
so
much
in
arrears
that
it
would
have
to
be
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
give
it
to
nor
had
he
any
berg
had
already
been
engaged
a
and
only
a
week
remained
before
the
but
the
count
had
not
yet
decided
in
his
own
mind
the
question
of
the
nor
spoken
to
his
wife
about
at
one
time
the
count
thought
of
giving
her
the
ryazan
estate
or
of
selling
a
at
another
time
of
borrowing
money
on
a
note
of
a
few
days
before
the
wedding
berg
entered
the
study
early
one
morning
with
a
pleasant
respectfully
asked
his
future
to
let
him
know
what
dowry
would
the
count
was
so
disconcerted
by
this
inquiry
that
without
consideration
he
gave
the
first
reply
that
came
into
his
like
your
being
businesslike
about
i
like
you
shall
be
and
patting
berg
on
the
shoulder
he
got
wishing
to
end
the
but
smiling
explained
that
if
he
did
not
know
for
certain
how
much
vera
would
have
and
did
not
receive
at
least
part
of
the
dowry
in
he
would
have
to
break
matters
i
allowed
myself
to
marry
now
without
having
definite
means
to
maintain
my
i
should
be
acting
the
conversation
ended
by
the
who
wished
to
be
generous
and
to
avoid
further
saying
that
he
would
give
a
note
of
hand
for
eighty
thousand
berg
smiled
kissed
the
count
on
the
and
said
that
he
was
very
but
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
arrange
his
new
life
without
receiving
thirty
thousand
in
ready
at
least
twenty
he
then
a
note
of
hand
for
only
sixty
all
said
the
count
excuse
my
dear
give
you
twenty
thousand
and
a
note

chapter
xii
natasha
was
sixteen
and
it
was
the
year
the
very
year
to
which
she
had
counted
on
her
fingers
with
boris
after
they
had
kissed
four
years
since
then
she
had
not
seen
before
sonya
and
her
if
boris
happened
to
be
she
spoke
quite
freely
of
that
episode
as
of
some
matter
that
was
not
worth
but
in
the
secret
depths
of
her
soul
the
question
whether
her
engagement
to
boris
was
a
jest
or
an
binding
promise
tormented
since
boris
left
moscow
in
1805
to
join
the
army
he
had
not
seen
the
he
had
been
in
moscow
several
and
had
passed
near
but
had
never
been
to
see
sometimes
it
occurred
to
natasha
that
he
did
not
wish
to
see
and
this
conjecture
was
confirmed
by
the
sad
tone
in
which
her
elders
spoke
of
old
friends
are
not
the
countess
would
say
when
boris
was
anna
mikhaylovna
also
had
of
late
visited
them
less
seemed
to
hold
herself
with
particular
and
always
spoke
rapturously
and
gratefully
of
the
merits
of
her
son
and
the
brilliant
career
on
which
he
had
when
the
rostovs
came
to
petersburg
boris
called
on
he
drove
to
their
house
in
some
the
memory
of
natasha
was
his
most
poetic
but
he
went
with
the
firm
intention
of
letting
her
and
her
parents
feel
that
the
childish
relations
between
himself
and
natasha
could
not
be
binding
either
on
her
or
on
he
had
a
brilliant
position
in
society
thanks
to
his
intimacy
with
countess
a
brilliant
position
in
the
service
thanks
to
the
patronage
of
an
important
personage
whose
complete
confidence
he
and
he
was
beginning
to
make
plans
for
marrying
one
of
the
richest
heiresses
in
plans
which
might
very
easily
be
when
he
entered
the
drawing
room
natasha
was
in
her
own
when
she
heard
of
his
arrival
she
almost
ran
into
the
drawing
flushed
and
beaming
with
a
more
than
cordial
boris
remembered
natasha
in
a
short
with
dark
eyes
shining
from
under
her
curls
and
childish
as
he
had
known
her
four
years
and
so
he
was
taken
aback
when
quite
a
different
natasha
and
his
face
expressed
rapturous
this
expression
on
his
face
pleased
do
you
recognize
your
little
madcap
asked
the
boris
kissed
hand
and
said
that
he
was
astonished
at
the
change
in
handsome
you
have
should
think
replied
laughing
is
papa
she
natasha
sat
down
without
joining
in
conversation
with
the
silently
and
minutely
studied
her
he
felt
the
weight
of
that
resolute
and
affectionate
scrutiny
and
glanced
at
her
and
the
way
his
hair
was
brushed
were
all
comme
il
faut
and
in
the
latest
this
natasha
noticed
at
he
sat
rather
sideways
in
the
armchair
next
to
the
arranging
with
his
right
hand
the
cleanest
of
gloves
that
fitted
his
left
hand
like
a
and
he
spoke
with
a
particularly
refined
compression
of
his
lips
about
the
amusements
of
the
highest
petersburg
recalling
with
mild
irony
old
times
in
moscow
and
moscow
it
was
not
natasha
that
he
when
speaking
of
the
highest
to
an
ball
he
had
and
to
invitations
he
had
received
from
and
all
this
time
natasha
sat
glancing
up
at
him
from
under
her
this
gaze
disturbed
and
confused
boris
more
and
he
looked
round
more
frequently
toward
and
broke
off
in
what
he
was
he
did
not
stay
more
than
ten
then
rose
and
took
his
the
same
and
rather
mocking
eyes
still
looked
at
after
his
first
visit
boris
said
to
himself
that
natasha
attracted
him
just
as
much
as
but
that
he
must
not
yield
to
that
because
to
marry
a
girl
almost
without
would
mean
ruin
to
his
while
to
renew
their
former
relations
without
intending
to
marry
her
would
be
boris
made
up
his
mind
to
avoid
meeting
but
despite
that
resolution
he
called
again
a
few
days
later
and
began
calling
often
and
spending
whole
days
at
the
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
ought
to
have
an
explanation
with
natasha
and
tell
her
that
the
old
times
must
be
that
in
spite
of
she
could
not
be
his
that
he
had
no
and
they
would
never
let
her
marry
but
he
failed
to
do
so
and
felt
awkward
about
entering
on
such
an
from
day
to
day
he
became
more
and
more
it
seemed
to
her
mother
and
sonya
that
natasha
was
in
love
with
boris
as
of
she
sang
him
his
favorite
showed
him
her
making
him
write
in
did
not
allow
him
to
allude
to
the
letting
it
be
understood
how
delightful
was
the
and
every
day
he
went
away
in
a
without
having
said
what
he
meant
and
not
knowing
what
he
was
doing
or
why
he
or
how
it
would
all
he
left
off
visiting
helene
and
received
reproachful
notes
from
her
every
and
yet
he
continued
to
spend
whole
days
with
the
chapter
xiii
one
night
when
the
old
in
nightcap
and
dressing
without
her
false
and
with
her
poor
little
knob
of
hair
showing
under
her
white
cotton
knelt
sighing
and
groaning
on
a
rug
and
bowing
to
the
ground
in
her
door
creaked
and
also
in
a
dressing
jacket
with
slippers
on
her
bare
feet
and
her
hair
in
ran
the
prayerful
mood
round
and
she
was
finishing
her
last
it
be
that
this
couch
will
be
my
flushed
and
seeing
her
mother
in
suddenly
checked
her
half
sat
and
unconsciously
put
out
her
tongue
as
if
chiding
seeing
that
her
mother
was
still
praying
she
ran
on
tiptoe
to
the
bed
rapidly
slipping
one
little
foot
against
the
pushed
off
her
slippers
and
jumped
onto
the
bed
the
countess
had
feared
might
become
her
this
couch
was
with
a
feather
bed
and
five
pillows
each
smaller
than
the
one
natasha
jumped
on
sank
into
the
feather
rolled
over
to
the
and
began
snuggling
up
the
bedclothes
as
she
settled
raising
her
knees
to
her
kicking
out
and
laughing
almost
now
covering
herself
up
head
and
and
now
peeping
at
her
the
countess
finished
her
prayers
and
came
to
the
bed
with
a
stern
but
that
head
was
she
smiled
in
her
weak
now
said
can
we
have
a
said
just
one
on
your
throat
and
and
seizing
her
mother
round
the
she
kissed
her
on
the
in
her
behavior
to
her
mother
natasha
seemed
but
she
was
so
sensitive
and
tactful
that
however
she
clasped
her
mother
she
always
managed
to
do
it
without
hurting
her
or
making
her
feel
uncomfortable
or
what
is
it
said
the
having
arranged
her
pillows
and
waited
until
after
turning
over
a
couple
of
had
settled
down
beside
her
under
the
spread
out
her
and
assumed
a
serious
these
visits
of
at
night
before
the
count
returned
from
his
club
were
one
of
the
greatest
pleasures
of
both
and
is
it
i
have
to
tell

her
hand
on
her
i

she
removed

as
she
said
this
the
countess
looked
round
at
her
natasha
was
lying
looking
steadily
straight
before
her
at
one
of
the
mahogany
sphinxes
carved
on
the
corners
of
the
so
that
the
countess
only
saw
her
face
in
that
face
struck
her
by
its
peculiarly
serious
and
concentrated
natasha
was
listening
and
what
said

quite
turned
his
and
what
do
you
want
of

without

large

on

back
and
then
on
the
then
again
turned
it
over
and
began
kissing
first
one
then
the
space
between
the
then
the
next
why
you
say
said
turning
to
her
who
was
tenderly
gazing
at
her
daughter
and
in
that
contemplation
seemed
to
have
forgotten
all
she
had
wished
to
my
not
everyone
will
understand
this
friendship
dating
from
your
childish
and
to
see
him
so
intimate
with
you
may
injure
you
in
the
eyes
of
other
young
men
who
visit
and
above
all
it
torments
him
for
he
may
already
have
found
a
suitable
and
wealthy
and
now
half
repeated
tell

some
things
about

a
cyril

smiled
and
looked
at
her
to
but
just
she
my
no
need
for
me
to
marry
just
just
repeated
the
and
shaking
all
she
went
off
into

she
rushed
forward
so
that
the
maids
who
were
tacking
up

natasha
had
not
had
a
moment
free
since
early
morning
and
had
not
once
had
time
to
think
of
what
lay
before
in
the
damp
chill
air
and
crowded
closeness
of
the
swaying
she
for
the
first
time
vividly
imagined
what
was
in
store
for
her
there
at
the
in
those
brightly
lighted
the
and
all
the
brilliant
young
people
of
the
prospect
was
so
splendid
that
she
hardly
believed
it
would
come
so
out
of
keeping
was
it
with
the
chill
darkness
and
closeness
of
the
she
understood
all
that
awaited
her
only
after
stepping
over
the
red
baize
at
the
she
entered
the
took
off
her
fur
beside
sonya
and
in
front
of
her
mounted
the
brightly
illuminated
stairs
between
the
only
then
did
she
remember
how
she
must
behave
at
a
and
tried
to
assume
the
majestic
air
she
considered
indispensable
for
a
girl
on
such
an
fortunately
for
she
felt
her
eyes
growing
she
saw
nothing
her
pulse
beat
a
hundred
to
the
and
the
blood
throbbed
at
her
she
could
not
assume
that
which
would
have
made
her
and
she
moved
on
almost
fainting
from
excitement
and
trying
with
all
her
might
to
conceal
and
this
was
the
very
attitude
that
became
her
before
and
behind
them
other
visitors
were
also
talking
in
low
tones
and
wearing
ball
the
mirrors
on
the
landing
reflected
ladies
in
and
pink
with
diamonds
and
pearls
on
their
bare
necks
and
natasha
looked
in
the
mirrors
and
could
not
distinguish
her
reflection
from
the
all
was
blended
into
one
brilliant
on
entering
the
ballroom
the
regular
hum
of
and
greetings
deafened
and
the
light
and
glitter
dazzled
her
still
the
host
and
who
had
already
been
standing
at
the

for
half
an
hour
repeating
the

words

the

to
see
the
two
girls
in
their
white
each
with
a
rose
in
her
black
both
curtsied
in
the
same
but
the
eye
involuntarily
rested
longer
on
the
slim
she
looked
at
her
and
gave
her
alone
a
special
smile
in
addition
to
her
usual
smile
as
looking
at
her
she
may
have
recalled
the
irrecoverable
days
of
her
own
girlhood
and
her
own
first
the
host
also
followed
natasha
with
his
eyes
and
asked

that
several

were
asking
about
her

that

looking
animated
and
bright
in
the
front

from

talking
to
him
about
the
first

give

about

concerning

various
rumors
were

not
listening
to
what
firhoff
was
he
was
gazing
now
at
the
sovereign
and
now
at
the
men
intending
to
dance
who
had
not
yet
gathered
courage
to
enter
the

watching
these

asked

into

frightened
happy
little
girl
seemed
to

by
the
smile
that
replaced
the
threatened
as
she
raised
her
hand
to
prince
they
were
the
second
couple
to
enter
the
prince
andrew
was
one
of
the
best
dancers
of
his
day
and
natasha
danced
her
little
feet
in
their
white
satin
dancing
shoes
did
their
work
and
independently
of
while
her
face
beamed
with
ecstatic
her
slender
bare
arms
and
neck
were
not
to
her
shoulders
looked
thin
and
her
bosom
but
helene
as
it
hardened
by
a
varnish
left
by
the
thousands
of
looks
that
had
scanned
her
while
natasha
was
like
a
girl
exposed
for
the
first
who
would
have
felt
very
much
ashamed
had
she
not
been
assured
that
this
was
absolutely
prince
andrew
liked
and
wishing
to
escape
as
quickly
as
possible
from
the
political
and
clever
talk
which
everyone
addressed
to
wishing
also
to
break
up
the
circle
of
restraint
he
caused
by
the
he
and
had
chosen
natasha
because
pierre
pointed
her
out
to
him
and
because
she
was
the
first
pretty
girl
who
caught
his
but
scarcely
had
he
embraced
that
slender
supple
figure
and
felt
her
stirring
so
close
to
him
and
smiling
so
near
him
than
the
wine
of
her
charm
rose
to
his
and
he
felt
himself
revived
and
rejuvenated
when
after
leaving
her
he
stood
breathing
deeply
and
watching
the
other
chapter
xvii
after
prince
boris
came
up
to
ask
natasha
for
a
and
then
the
who
had
opened
the
and
several
other
young
so
flushed
and
and
passing
on
her
superfluous
partners
to
she
did
not
cease
dancing
all
the
she
noticed
and
saw
nothing
of
what
occupied
everyone
not
only
did
she
fail
to
notice
that
the
emperor
talked
a
long
time
with
the
french
and
how
particularly
gracious
he
was
to
a
certain
or
that
prince
and
did
and
said
this
and
and
that
helene
had
great
success
and
was
honored
by
the
special
attention
of
but
she
did
not
even
see
the
and
only
noticed
that
he
had
gone
because
the
ball
became
livelier
after
his
for
one
of
the
merry
cotillions
before
supper
prince
andrew
was
again
her
he
reminded
her
of
their
first
encounter
in
the
otradnoe
and
how
she
had
been
unable
to
sleep
that
moonlight
and
told
her
how
he
had
involuntarily
overheard
natasha
blushed
at
that
recollection
and
tried
to
excuse
as
if
there
had
been
something
to
be
ashamed
of
in
what
prince
andrew
had
like
all
men
who
have
grown
up
in
prince
andrew
liked
meeting
someone
there
not
of
the
conventional
society
and
such
was
with
her
her
her
and
even
her
mistakes
in
speaking
with
her
he
behaved
with
special
care
and
sitting
beside
her
and
talking
of
the
simplest
and
most
unimportant
he
admired
her
shy
in
the
middle
of
the
having
completed
one
of
the
still

of

returning
to
her
seat
when
another

tired
and
panting

how

glad

you

understand

and
much
more
was
said
in
her
when
her
partner
left
her
natasha
ran
across
the
room
to
choose
two
ladies
for
the

her
cousin

then
to
another

his
own

he
watched

go
first
to
her

prince
what
is
certain
is
that
that
girl
is
so
so
that
she

before

to

asked
his
daughter

not
answer
at
once

only
looked
up
with
a
smile
that
said

so
much
she
and
prince
andrew
noticed
how
her
thin

rose
quickly
as
if
to
embrace
her
father
and
instantly
dropped

happier
than
she
had

was
at

height

kind
and
good
and
does
not

in

for
the

by
the
position
his

occupied
in

he
was
gloomy
and
a
deep
furrow
ran
across
his
and
standing
by

window
he
stared
over

spectacles

chapter
xviii
next
day
prince
andrew
thought
of
the
but
his
mind
did
not
dwell
on
it
it
was
a
very
brilliant
and
that
little
rostova
is
very
something
about
her
that
distinguishes
that
was
all
he
thought
about
and
after
his
morning
tea
he
set
to
but
either
from
fatigue
or
want
of
sleep
he
was
for
work
and
could
get
nothing
he
kept
criticizing
his
own
as
he
often
and
was
glad
when
he
heard
someone
the
visitor
was
who
served
on
various
frequented
all
the
societies
in
and
a
passionate
devotee
of
the
new
ideas
and
of
and
a
diligent
petersburg
of
those
men
who
choose
their
opinions
like
their
clothes
according
to
the
but
who
for
that
very
reason
appear
to
be
the
warmest
hardly
had
he
got
rid
of
his
hat
before
he
ran
into
prince
room
with
a
preoccupied
air
and
at
once
began
he
had
just
heard
particulars
of
that
sitting
of
the
council
of
state
opened
by
the
and
he
spoke
of
it
the
speech
had
been
it
had
been
a
speech
such
as
only
constitutional
monarchs
sovereign
plainly
said
that
the
council
and
senate
are
estates
of
the
he
said
that
the
government
must
rest
not
on
authority
but
on
secure
the
emperor
said
that
the
fiscal
system
must
be
reorganized
and
the
accounts
recounted
emphasizing
certain
words
and
opening
his
eyes
events
mark
an
the
greatest
epoch
in
our
he
prince
andrew
listened
to
the
account
of
the
opening
of
the
council
of
which
he
had
so
impatiently
awaited
and
to
which
he
had
attached
such
and
was
surprised
that
this
now
that
it
had
taken
did
not
affect
and
even
seemed
quite
he
listened
with
quiet
irony
to
enthusiastic
account
of
a
very
simple
thought
occurred
to
does
it
matter
to
me
or
to
bitski
what
the
emperor
was
pleased
to
say
at
the
can
all
that
make
me
any
happier
or
and
this
simple
reflection
suddenly
destroyed
all
the
interest
prince
andrew
had
felt
in
the
impending
he
was
going
to
dine
that
evening
at
only
a
few
as
the
host
had
said
when
inviting
the
prospect
of
that
dinner
in
the
intimate
home
circle
of
the
man
he
so
admired
had
greatly
interested
prince
especially
as
he
had
not
yet
seen
speranski
in
his
domestic
but
now
he
felt
disinclined
to
go
to
at
the
appointed
he
entered
the
modest
house
speranski
owned
in
the
taurida
in
the
parqueted
dining
room
this
small
remarkable
for
its
extreme
cleanliness
that
of
a
prince
who
was
rather
found
the
friendly
gathering
of
intimate
acquaintances
already
assembled
at
five
there
were
no
ladies
present
except
little
daughter
like
her
and
her
the
other
guests
were
and
while
still
in
the
anteroom
prince
andrew
heard
loud
voices
and
a
ringing
staccato
laugh
such
as
one
hears
on
the
sounded
like
distinctly
ejaculating
prince
andrew
had
never
before
heard
famous
and
this
laughter
from
a
statesman
made
a
strange
impression
on
he
entered
the
dining
the
whole
company
were
standing
between
two
windows
at
a
small
table
laid
with
wearing
a
gray
coat
with
a
star
on
the
and
evidently
still
the
same
waistcoat
and
high
white
stock
he
had
worn
at
the
meeting
of
the
council
of
stood
at
the
table
with
a
beaming
his
guests
surrounded
addressing
himself
to

relating
an
and
speranski
was
laughing
in
advance
at
what
magnitski
was
going
to
when
prince
andrew
entered
the
room
words
were
again
crowned
by
stolypin
gave
a
deep
bass
guffaw
as
he
munched
a
piece
of
bread
and
gervais
laughed
softly
with
a
hissing
and
speranski
in
a
staccato
still
speranski
held
out
his
soft
white
hand
to
prince
pleased
to
see
he
he
went
turning
to
magnitski
and
interrupting
his
have
agreed
that
this
is
a
dinner
for
with
not
a
word
about
and
turning
again
to
the
narrator
he
began
to
laugh
prince
andrew
looked
at
the
laughing
speranski
with
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
this
was
not
speranski
but
someone
everything
that
had
formerly
appeared
mysterious
and
fascinating
in
speranski
suddenly
became
plain
and
at
dinner
the
conversation
did
not
cease
for
a
moment
and
seemed
to
consist
of
the
contents
of
a
book
of
funny
before
magnitski
had
finished
his
story
someone
else
was
anxious
to
relate
something
still
most
of
the
if
not
relating
to
the
state
related
to
people
in
the
it
seemed
that
in
this
company
the
insignificance
of
those
people
was
so
definitely
accepted
that
the
only
possible
attitude
toward
them
was
one
of
good
humored
speranski
related
how
at
the
council
that
morning
a
deaf
when
asked

that
he
thought
so
gervais
gave
a
long
account
of
an
official
remarkable
for
the
stupidity
of
everybody
broke
into
the
conversation
and
began
excitedly
talking
of
the
abuses
that
existed
under
the
former
order
of
to
give
a
serious
turn
to
the
magnitski
starting
quizzing
stolypin
about
his
gervais
intervened
with
a
and
the
talk
reverted
to
its
former
lively
evidently
speranski
liked
to
rest
after
his
labors
and
find
amusement
in
a
circle
of
and
his
understanding
his
tried
to
enliven
him
and
amuse
but
their
gaiety
seemed
to
prince
andrew
mirthless
and
voice
struck
him
and
the
incessant
laughter
grated
on
him
like
a
false
prince
andrew
did
not
laugh
and
feared
that
he
would
be
a
damper
on
the
spirits
of
the
but
no
one
took
any
notice
of
his
being
out
of
harmony
with
the
general
they
all
seemed
very
he
tried
several
times
to
join
in
the
but
his
remarks
were
tossed
aside
each
time
like
a
cork
thrown
out
of
the
and
he
could
not
jest
with
there
was
nothing
wrong
or
unseemly
in
what
they
it
was
witty
and
might
have
been
but
it
lacked
just
that
something
which
is
the
salt
of
and
they
were
not
even
aware
that
such
a
thing
after
dinner
daughter
and
her
governess
he
patted
the
little
girl
with
his
white
hand
and
kissed
and
that
seemed
unnatural
to
prince
the
men
remained
at
table
over
their
in
the
midst
of
a
conversation
that
was
started
about
spanish
which
they
all
agreed
in
prince
andrew
began
to
express
a
contrary
speranski
smiled
with
an
evident
wish
to
prevent
the
conversation
from
taking
an
unpleasant
told
a
story
that
had
no
connection
with
the
previous
for
a
few
moments
all
were
having
sat
some
time
at
speranski
corked
a
bottle
of
wine
good
wine
rides
in
a
carriage
and
passed
it
to
the
servant
and
got
all
rose
and
continuing
to
talk
loudly
went
into
the
drawing
two
letters
brought
by
a
courier
were
handed
to
speranski
and
he
took
them
to
his
as
soon
as
he
had
left
the
room
the
general
merriment
stopped
and
the
guests
began
to
converse
sensibly
and
quietly
with
one
for
the
said
speranski
on
returning
from
his
wonderful
he
said
to
prince
and
magnitski
immediately
assumed
a
pose
and
began
reciting
some
humorous
verses
in
french
which
he
had
composed
about
various
petersburg
he
was
interrupted
several
times
by
when
the
verses
were
finished
prince
andrew
went
up
to
speranski
and
took
his
are
you
off
to
so
asked
promised
to
go
to
a
they
said
no
prince
andrew
looked
closely
into
those
impenetrable
and
felt
that
it
had
been
ridiculous
of
him
to
have
expected
anything
from
speranski
and
from
any
of
his
own
activities
connected
with
or
ever
to
have
attributed
importance
to
what
speranski
was
that
mirthless
laughter
rang
in
prince
ears
long
after
he
had
left
the
when
he
reached
home
prince
andrew
began
thinking
of
his
life
in
petersburg
during
those
last
four
months
as
if
it
were
something
he
recalled
his
exertions
and
and
the
history
of
his
project
of
army
which
had
been
accepted
for
consideration
and
which
they
were
trying
to
pass
over
in
silence
simply
because
a
very
poor
had
already
been
prepared
and
submitted
to
the
he
thought
of
the
meetings
of
a
committee
of
which
berg
was
a
he
remembered
how
carefully
and
at
what
length
everything
relating
to
form
and
procedure
was
discussed
at
those
and
how
sedulously
and
promptly
all
that
related
to
the
gist
of
the
business
was
he
recalled
his
labors
on
the
legal
and
how
painstakingly
he
had
translated
the
articles
of
the
roman
and
french
codes
into
and
he
felt
ashamed
of
then
he
vividly
pictured
to
himself
his
occupations
in
the
his
journey
to
he
remembered
the
peasants
and
dron
the
village
and
mentally
applying
to
them
the
personal
rights
he
had
divided
into

felt
astonished
that
he
could
have
spent
so
much
time
on
such
useless
chapter

next
day
prince
andrew
called
at
a
few
houses
he
had
not
visited
and
among
them
at
the
with
whom
he
had
renewed
acquaintance
at
the
apart
from
considerations
of
politeness
which
demanded
the
he
wanted
to
see
that
eager
girl
who
had
left
such
a
pleasant
impression
on
his
in
her
own
natasha
was
one
of
the
first
to
meet
she
was
wearing
a
house
dress
in
which
prince
andrew
thought
her
even
prettier
than
in
her
ball
she
and
all
the
rostov
family
welcomed
him
as
an
old
simply
and
the
whole
whom
he
had
formerly
judged
now
seemed
to
him
to
consist
of
and
kindly
the
old
hospitality
and
good
which
struck
one
especially
in
petersburg
as
a
pleasant
were
such
that
prince
andrew
could
not
refuse
to
stay
to
he
are
capital
who
of
course
have
not
the
slightest
idea
what
a
treasure
they
possess
in
but
they
are
kindly
folk
and
form
the
best
possible
setting
for
this
strikingly
charming
overflowing
with
in
natasha
prince
andrew
was
conscious
of
a
strange
world
completely
alien
to
him
and
brimful
of
joys
unknown
to
a
different
that
in
the
otradnoe
avenue
and
at
the
window
that
moonlight
night
had
already
begun
to
disconcert
now
this
world
disconcerted
him
no
longer
and
was
no
longer
alien
to
but
he
himself
having
entered
it
found
in
it
a
new
after
dinner
at
prince
went
to
the
clavichord
and
began
prince
andrew
stood
by
a
window
talking
to
the
ladies
and
listened
to
in
the
midst
of
a
phrase
he
ceased
speaking
and
suddenly
felt
tears
choking
a
thing
he
had
thought
impossible
for
he
looked
at
natasha
as
she
and
something
new
and
joyful
stirred
in
his
he
felt
happy
and
at
the
same
time
he
had
absolutely
nothing
to
weep
about
yet
he
was
ready
to
what
his
former
the
little
his
his
hopes
for
the
yes
and
the
chief
reason
was
a
vivid
sense
of
the
terrible
contrast
between
something
infinitely
great
and
illimitable
within
him
and
that
limited
and
material
something
that
and
even
this
contrast
weighed
on
and
yet
cheered
him
while
she
as
soon
as
natasha
had
finished
she
went
up
to
him
and
asked
how
he
liked
her
she
asked
this
and
then
became
feeling
that
she
ought
not
to
have
asked
he
looking
at
and
said
he
liked
her
singing
as
he
liked
everything
she
prince
andrew
left
the
late
in
the
he
went
to
bed
from
but
soon
realized
that
he
could
not
having
lit
his
candle
he
sat
up
in
then
got
then
lay
down
again
not
at
all
troubled
by
his
his
soul
was
as
fresh
and
joyful
as
if
he
had
stepped
out
of
a
stuffy
room
into
own
fresh
it
did
not
enter
his
head
that
he
was
in
love
with
he
was
not
thinking
about
but
only
picturing
her
to
and
in
consequence
all
life
appeared
in
a
new
do
i
why
do
i
toil
in
this
confined
when
all
life
with
all
its
is
open
to
said
he
to
and
for
the
first
time
for
a
very
long
while
he
began
making
happy
plans
for
the
he
decided
that
he
must
attend
to
his
education
by
finding
a
tutor
and
putting
the
boy
in
his
then
he
ought
to
retire
from
the
service
and
go
and
see
switzerland
and
must
use
my
freedom
while
i
feel
so
much
strength
and
youth
in
he
said
to
was
right
when
he
said
one
must
believe
in
the
possibility
of
happiness
in
order
to
be
and
now
i
do
believe
in
let
the
dead
bury
their
but
while
one
has
life
one
must
live
and
be
thought

xx
one
morning
colonel
whom
pierre
knew
as
he
knew
everybody
in
moscow
and
came
to
see

in
an
immaculate
with
his

so
i

just
a
small
party
for
my
own
and
my
smiled

wished
to
ask
the
countess
and
you
to
do
me
the
honor
of
coming
to
tea
and
to
only
countess
considering
the
society
of
such
people
as
the
bergs
beneath
could
be
cruel
enough
to
refuse
such
an
berg
explained
so
clearly
why
he
wanted
to
collect
at
his
house
a
small
but
select
and
why
this
would
give
him
and
why
though
he
grudged
spending
money
on
cards
or
anything
he
was
prepared
to
run
into
some
expense
for
the
sake
of
good
pierre

not
and
promised
to
be
if
i
may
venture
to
about
ten
minutes
to
we
shall
make
up
a
our
general

he
is
very
good
to
we
shall
have
so
you
will
do

the
contrary
to
his
habit
of
being
pierre
on
that
day
arrived
at
the
not
at
ten
but
at
fifteen
minutes
to
having
prepared
everything
necessary
for
the

ready
for

their
and
light
study
with
its
small
busts
and
pictures
and
new
furniture
sat
berg
and
his
closely
buttoned
up
in
his
new
sat
beside
his
wife
explaining
to
her
that
one
always
could
and
should
be
acquainted
with
people
above
because
only
then
does
one
get
satisfaction
from

get
to
know

can
ask
for

how

managed

my
first

but
by

only
waiting
for
a
vacancy
to
command

have
the
happiness
to
be

kissed
and
on
the
way
to
her
straightened
out
a
corner
of
the
how
have
i
obtained
all
chiefly
by
knowing
how
to
choose
my
it
goes
without
saying
that
one
must
be
conscientious
and
berg
smiled
with
a
sense
of
his
superiority
over
a
weak
and
reflecting
that
this
dear
wife
of
his
was
after
all
but
a
weak
woman
who
could
not
understand
all
that
constitutes
a
what
it
was
ein
mann
zu
vera
at
the
same
time
smiling
with
a
sense
of
superiority
over
her
conscientious
who
all
the
same
understood
life
as
according
to
vera
all
men
judging
by
his
thought
all
women
weak
and
judging
only
by
her
husband
and
generalizing
from
that
supposed
that
all
though
they
understand
nothing
and
are
conceited
and
ascribe
common
sense
to
themselves
to
be
a
berg
rose
and
embraced
his
wife
so
as
not
to
crush
her
lace
fichu
for
which
he
had
paid
a
good
kissing
her
straight
on
the
only
thing
we
have
children
too

following
an
unconscious
sequence
of
answered

all

must
live
for

wore
one
exactly
like
said
pointing
to
the
fichu
with
a
happy
and
kindly
just
then

was
husband
and
wife
glanced
at
one
both
smiling
with
and
each
mentally
claiming
the
honor
of
this

what
comes

knowing
how
to
make

please
interrupt
me
when
i
am
entertaining
the
said
i
know
what
interests
each
of
them
and
what
to
say
to
different
berg
smiled
be
men
must
sometimes
have
masculine
said
they
received
pierre
in
their
new
where
it
was
impossible
to
sit
down
anywhere
without
disturbing
its
and
so
it
was
quite
comprehensible
and
not
strange
that
having
generously
offered
to
disturb
the
symmetry
of
an
armchair
or
of
the
sofa
for
his
dear
but
being
apparently
painfully
undecided
on
the
matter
eventually
left
the
visitor
to
settle
the
question
of
pierre
disturbed
the
symmetry
by
moving
a
chair
for
and
berg
and
vera
immediately
began
their
evening
interrupting
each
other
in
their
efforts
to
entertain
their
having
decided
in
her
own
mind
that
pierre
ought
to
be
entertained
with
conversation
about
the
french
at
once
began
having
decided
that
masculine
conversation
was
interrupted
his
remarks
and
touched
on
the
question
of
the
war
with
and
unconsciously
jumped
from
the
general
subject
to
personal
considerations
as
to
the
proposals
made
him
to
take
part
in
the
austrian
campaign
and
the
reasons
why
he
had
declined
though
the
conversation
was
very
incoherent
and
vera
was
angry
at
the
intrusion
of
the
masculine
both
husband
and
wife
felt
with
satisfaction
even
if
only
one
guest
was
their
evening
had
begun
very
well
and
was
as
like
as
two
peas
to
every
other
evening
party
with
its
and
lighted
before
long
old
there
was
a
shade
of
condescension
and
patronage
in
his
treatment
of
berg
and
after
boris
came
a
lady
with
the
then
the
general
then
the
and
the
party
became
unquestionably
exactly
like
all
other
evening
berg
and
vera
could
not
repress
their
smiles
of
satisfaction
at
the
sight
of
all
this
movement
in
their
drawing
at
the
sound
of
the
disconnected
the
rustling
of
and
the
bowing
and
everything
was
just
as
everybody
always
has
especially
so
the
who
admired
the
patted
berg
on
the
and
with
parental
authority
superintended
the
setting
out
of
the
table

down

himself

with
the
the
young

the
and
the
hostess
at
the
tea
on
which
stood
exactly
the
same
kind
of
cakes
in
a
silver
cake

as
the
panins
had
at

was
just

chapter
xxi
as
one
of
the
principal
had
to
sit
down
to
boston
with
count
the
and
the
at
the
card
table
he
happened
to
be
directly
facing
and
was
struck
by
a
curious
change
that
had
come
over
her
since
the
she
was
and
not
only
less
pretty
than
at
the
but
only
redeemed
from
plainness
by
her
look
of
gentle
indifference
to
everything
the
matter
with
thought
glancing
at
she
was
sitting
by
her
sister
at
the
tea
and
without
looking
at
made
some
reply
to
boris
who
sat
down
beside
after
playing
out
a
whole
suit
and
to
his
delight
taking
five
hearing
greetings
and
the
steps
of
someone
who
had
entered
the
room
while
he
was
picking
up
his
glanced
again
at
has
happened
to
he
asked
himself
with
still
greater
prince
andrew
was
standing
before
saying
something
to
her
with
a
look
of
tender
having
raised
her
was
looking
up
at
flushed
and
evidently
trying
to
master
her
rapid
and
the
bright
glow
of
some
inner
fire
that
had
been
suppressed
was
again
alight
in
she
was
completely
transformed
and
from
a
plain
girl
had
again
become
what
she
had
been
at
the
prince
andrew
went
up
to
and
the
latter
noticed
a
new
and
youthful
expression
in
his
pierre
changed
places
several
times
during
the
sitting
now
with
his
back
to
natasha
and
now
facing
but
during
the
whole
of
the
six
rubbers
he
watched
her
and
his
very
important
is
happening
between
thought
and
a
feeling
that
was
both
joyful
and
painful
agitated
him
and
made
him
neglect
the
after
six
rubbers
the
general
got
saying
that
it
was
no
use
playing
like
and
pierre
was
natasha
on
one
side
was
talking
with
sonya
and
and
vera
with
a
subtle
smile
was
saying
something
to
prince
pierre
went
up
to
his
friend
asking
whether
they
were
talking
sat
down
beside
having
noticed
prince
attentions
to
decided
that
at
a
a
real
evening
subtle
allusions
to
the
tender
passion
were
absolutely
necessary
seizing
a
moment
when
prince
andrew
was
began
a
conversation
with
him
about
feelings
in
general
and
about
her
with
so
intellectual
a
guest
as
she
considered
prince
andrew
to
she
felt
that
she
had
to
employ
her
diplomatic
when
pierre
went
up
to
them
he
noticed
that
vera
was
being
carried
away
by
her
but
that
prince
andrew
seemed
a
thing
that
rarely
happened
with
do
you
vera
was
saying
with
an
arch
are
so
and
understand
characters
so
well
at
a
what
do
you
think
of
could
she
be
constant
in
her
could
like
other
meant
a
man
once
for
all
and
remain
true
to
him
that
is
what
i
consider
true
what
do
you
know
your
sister
too
replied
prince
with
a
sarcastic
smile
under
which
he
wished
to
hide
his
be
able
to
solve
so
delicate
a
and
then
i
have
noticed
that
the
less
attractive
a
woman
is
the
more
constant
she
is
likely
to
he
and
looked
up
at
pierre
who
was
just
approaching
that
is
in
our
continued
as
people
of
limited
intelligence
are
fond
of
imagining
that
they
have
discovered
and
appraised
the
peculiarities
of
and
that
human
characteristics
change
with
the
our
days
a
girl
has
so
much
freedom
that
the
pleasure
of
being
courted
often
stifles
real
feeling
in
and
it
must
be
confessed
that
natalie
is
very
this
return
to
the
subject
of
natalie
caused
prince
andrew
to
knit
his
brows
with
he
was
about
to
but
vera
continued
with
a
still
more
subtle
think
no
one
has
been
more
courted
than
she
went
till
quite
lately
she
never
cared
seriously
for
now
you
she
said
to
our
dear
cousin
between
was
very
far
gone
in
the
land
of
to
a
map
of
love
much
in
vogue
at
that
prince
andrew
frowned
and
remained
are
friendly
with
asked
i
know
expect
he
has
told
you
of
his
childish
love
for
there
was
childish
suddenly
asked
prince
blushing
you
know
between
cousins
intimacy
often
leads
to
le
cousinage
est
un
dangereux
you
think
is
a
dangerous
said
prince
and
with
sudden
and
unnatural
liveliness
he
began
chaffing
pierre
about
the
need
to
be
very
careful
with
his
moscow
and
in
the
midst
of
these
jesting
remarks
he
taking
pierre
by
the
and
drew
him
asked
seeing
his
strange
animation
with
and
noticing
the
glance
he
turned
on
natasha
as
he
i
must
have
a
talk
with
said
prince
know
that
pair
of
referred
to
the
masonic
gloves
given
to
a
newly
initiated
brother
to
present
to
the
woman
he
but
i
will
talk
to
you
later
and
with
a
strange
light
in
his
eyes
and
restlessness
in
his
prince
andrew
approached
natasha
and
sat
down
beside
pierre
saw
how
prince
andrew
asked
her
something
and
how
she
flushed
as
she
but
at
that
moment
berg
came
to
pierre
and
began
insisting
that
he
should
take
part
in
an
argument
between
the
general
and
the
colonel
on
the
affairs
in
berg
was
satisfied
and
the
smile
of
pleasure
never
left
his
the
party
was
very
successful
and
quite
like
other
parties
he
had
everything
was
the
subtle
the
the
general
raising
his
voice
at
the
card
and
the
samovar
and
the
tea
only
one
thing
was
lacking
that
he
had
always
seen
at
the
evening
parties
he
wished
to
they
had
not
yet
had
a
loud
conversation
among
the
men
and
a
dispute
about
something
important
and
now
the
general
had
begun
such
a
discussion
and
so
berg
drew
pierre
to
chapter
xxii
next
having
been
invited
by
the
prince
andrew
dined
with
the
rostovs
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
everyone
in
the
house
realized
for
whose
sake
prince
andrew
and
without
concealing
it
he
tried
to
be
with
natasha
all
not
only
in
the
soul
of
the
frightened
yet
happy
and
enraptured
but
in
the
whole
there
was
a
feeling
of
awe
at
something
important
that
was
bound
to
the
countess
looked
with
sad
and
sternly
serious
eyes
at
prince
andrew
when
he
talked
to
natasha
and
timidly
started
some
artificial
conversation
about
trifles
as
soon
as
he
looked
her
sonya
was
afraid
to
leave
natasha
and
afraid
of
being
in
the
way
when
she
was
with
natasha
grew
in
a
panic
of
when
she
remained
alone
with
him
for
a
prince
andrew
surprised
her
by
his
she
felt
that
he
wanted
to
say
something
to
her
but
could
not
bring
himself
to
do
in
the
when
prince
andrew
had
the
countess
went
up
to
natasha
and
for
sake
ask
me
anything
one
talk
about
said
but
all
the
same
that
night
now
agitated
and
now
lay
a
long
time
in
her
bed
gazing
straight
before
she
told
her
how
he
had
complimented
how
he
told
her
he
was
going
asked
her
where
they
were
going
to
spend
the
and
then
how
he
had
asked
her
about
such
such
never
happened
to
me
she
i
feel
afraid
in
his
i
am
always
afraid
when
with
what
does
that
does
it
mean
that
the
real
are
you
my
i
am
frightened
answered
her
the
same
i
what
to
such
a
thing
never
happened
to
me
she
surprised
and
alarmed
at
the
feeling
she
was
aware
of
in
could
we
ever
have
it
seemed
to
natasha
that
even
at
the
time
she
first
saw
prince
andrew
at
otradnoe
she
had
fallen
in
love
with
it
was
as
if
she
feared
this
unexpected
happiness
of
meeting
again
the
very
man
she
had
then
chosen
was
firmly
convinced
she
had
done
and
of
finding
as
it
not
indifferent
to
it
had
to
happen
that
he
should
come
specially
to
petersburg
while
we
are
and
it
had
to
happen
that
we
should
meet
at
that
it
is
clearly
it
is
fate
that
everything
led
up
to
already
directly
i
saw
him
i
felt
something
else
did
he
say
to
what
are
those
read
said
her
referring
to
some
verses
prince
andrew
had
written
in
one
need
not
be
ashamed
of
his
being
a
pray
to
are
made
in
said
her
how
i
love
how
happy
i
cried
shedding
tears
of
joy
and
excitement
and
embracing
her
at
that
very
time
prince
andrew
was
sitting
with
pierre
and
telling
him
of
his
love
for
natasha
and
his
firm
resolve
to
make
her
his
that
day
countess
helene
had
a
reception
at
her
the
french
ambassador
was
and
a
foreign
prince
of
the
blood
who
had
of
late
become
a
frequent
visitor
of
and
many
brilliant
ladies
and
who
had
come
walked
through
the
rooms
and
struck
everyone
by
his
and
morose
since
the
ball
he
had
felt
the
approach
of
a
fit
of
nervous
depression
and
had
made
desperate
efforts
to
combat
since
the
intimacy
of
his
wife
with
the
royal
pierre
had
unexpectedly
been
made
a
gentleman
of
the
and
from
that
time
he
had
begun
to
feel
oppressed
and
ashamed
in
court
and
dark
thoughts
of
the
vanity
of
all
things
human
came
to
him
oftener
than
at
the
same
time
the
feeling
he
had
noticed
between
his
protegee
natasha
and
prince
andrew
accentuated
his
gloom
by
the
contrast
between
his
own
position
and
his
he
tried
equally
to
avoid
thinking
about
his
and
about
natasha
and
prince
and
again
everything
seemed
to
him
insignificant
in
comparison
with
again
the
for
presented
and
he
forced
himself
to
work
day
and
night
at
masonic
hoping
to
drive
away
the
evil
spirit
that
threatened
toward
after
he
had
left
the
he
was
sitting
upstairs
in
a
shabby
dressing
copying
out
the
original
transaction
of
the
scottish
lodge
of
freemasons
at
a
table
in
his
low
room
cloudy
with
tobacco
when
someone
came
it
was
prince
said
pierre
with
a
dissatisfied
you
am
hard
at
he
pointed
to
his
manuscript
book
with
that
air
of
escaping
from
the
ills
of
life
with
which
unhappy
people
look
at
their
prince
with
a
ecstatic
expression
of
renewed
life
on
his
paused
in
front
of
pierre
not
noticing
his
sad
smiled
at
him
with
the
egotism
of
dear
said
wanted
to
tell
you
about
it
yesterday
and
i
have
come
to
do
so
i
never
experienced
anything
like
it
i
am
in
my
suddenly
pierre
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
dumped
his
heavy
person
down
on
the
sofa
beside
prince
natasha
said
who
else
should
it
i
should
never
have
believed
but
the
feeling
is
stronger
than
yesterday
i
tormented
myself
and
but
i
would
not
exchange
even
that
torment
for
anything
in
the
i
have
not
lived
till
at
last
i
but
i
live
without
but
can
she
love
i
am
too
old
for
why
you
what
did
i
tell
said
pierre
rising
and
beginning
to
pace
up
and
down
the
always
thought
that
girl
is
such
a
she
is
a
rare
my
dear
i
entreat
and
i
am
sure
there
will
not
be
a
happier
man
than
what
of
loves
talk
said
prince
smiling
and
looking
into
i
pierre
cried
do
returned
prince
holding
him
by
the
you
know
the
condition
i
am
i
must
talk
about
it
to
go
go
i
am
very
said
and
his
face
really
his
brow
became
and
he
listened
gladly
to
prince
prince
andrew
and
really
quite
a
quite
a
new
where
was
his
his
contempt
for
his
pierre
was
the
only
person
to
whom
he
made
up
his
mind
to
speak
and
to
him
he
told
all
that
was
in
his
now
he
boldly
and
lightly
made
plans
for
an
extended
said
he
could
not
sacrifice
his
own
happiness
to
his
and
spoke
of
how
he
would
either
make
his
father
consent
to
this
marriage
and
love
or
would
do
without
his
then
he
marveled
at
the
feeling
that
had
mastered
him
as
at
something
apart
from
and
independent
of
should
not
have
believed
anyone
who
told
me
that
i
was
capable
of
such
said
prince
is
not
at
all
the
same
feeling
that
i
knew
in
the
the
whole
world
is
now
for
me
divided
into
two
one
half
is
and
there
all
is
the
other
half
is
everything
where
she
is
and
there
is
all
gloom
and
and
reiterated
i
understand
cannot
help
loving
the
it
is
not
my
and
i
am
very
you
understand
i
know
you
are
glad
for
my
pierre
looking
at
his
friend
with
a
touched
and
sad
expression
in
his
the
brighter
prince
lot
appeared
to
the
gloomier
seemed
his
chapter
xxiii
prince
andrew
needed
his
consent
to
his
and
to
obtain
this
he
started
for
the
country
next
his
father
received
his
communication
with
external
but
inward
he
could
not
comprehend
how
anyone
could
wish
to
alter
his
life
or
introduce
anything
new
into
when
his
own
life
was
already
only
they
would
let
me
end
my
days
as
i
want
thought
the
old
they
might
do
as
they
with
his
he
employed
the
diplomacy
he
reserved
for
important
occasions
adopting
a
quiet
discussed
the
whole
in
the
first
place
the
marriage
was
not
a
brilliant
one
as
regards
or
prince
andrew
was
no
longer
as
young
as
he
had
been
and
his
health
was
poor
old
man
laid
special
stress
on
while
she
was
very
he
had
a
son
whom
it
would
be
a
pity
to
entrust
to
a
chit
of
a
and
the
father
looking
ironically
at
his
beg
you
to
put
it
off
for
a
go
take
a
look
out
as
you
wanted
to
for
a
german
tutor
for
prince
then
if
your
love
or
passion
or
you
still
as
and
my
last
word
on
the
concluded
the
in
a
tone
which
showed
that
nothing
would
make
him
alter
his
prince
andrew
saw
clearly
that
the
old
man
hoped
that
his
or
his
would
not
stand
a
or
that
he
old
prince
would
die
before
and
he
decided
to
conform
to
his
and
postpone
the
wedding
for
a
three
weeks
after
the
last
evening
he
had
spent
with
the
prince
andrew
returned
to
next
day
after
her
talk
with
her
mother
natasha
expected
bolkonski
all
but
he
did
not
on
the
second
and
third
day
it
was
the
pierre
did
not
come
either
and
not
knowing
that
prince
andrew
had
gone
to
see
his
could
not
explain
his
absence
to
three
weeks
passed
in
this
natasha
had
no
desire
to
go
out
anywhere
and
wandered
from
room
to
room
like
a
idle
and
she
wept
secretly
at
night
and
did
not
go
to
her
mother
in
the
she
blushed
continually
and
was
it
seemed
to
her
that
everybody
knew
about
her
disappointment
and
was
laughing
at
her
and
pitying
strong
as
was
her
inward
this
wound
to
her
vanity
intensified
her
once
she
came
to
her
tried
to
say
and
suddenly
began
to
her
tears
were
those
of
an
offended
child
who
does
not
know
why
it
is
being
the
countess
began
to
soothe
who
after
first
listening
to
her
suddenly
interrupted
i
and
want
to
think
about
he
just
came
and
then
left
left
her
voice
and
she
again
nearly
but
recovered
and
went
on
i
at
all
want
to
get
and
i
am
afraid
of
i
have
now
become
quite
quite
the
day
after
this
conversation
natasha
put
on
the
old
dress
which
she
knew
had
the
peculiar
property
of
conducing
to
cheerfulness
in
the
and
that
day
she
returned
to
the
old
way
of
life
which
she
had
abandoned
since
the
having
finished
her
morning
tea
she
went
to
the
which
she
particularly
liked
for
its
loud
and
began
singing
her
when
she
had
finished
her
first
exercise
she
stood
still
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
sang
a
musical
phrase
that
particularly
pleased
she
listened
joyfully
though
she
had
not
expected
to
the
charm
of
the
notes
filling
the
whole
empty
and
slowly
dying
and
all
at
once
she
felt
the
good
of
making
so
much
of
things
are
nice
as
it
she
said
to
and
she
began
walking
up
and
down
the
not
stepping
simply
on
the
resounding
parquet
but
treading
with
each
step
from
the
heel
to
the
toe
had
on
a
new
and
favorite
pair
of
and
listening
to
the
regular
tap
of
the
heel
and
creak
of
the
toe
as
gladly
as
she
had
to
the
sounds
of
her
own
passing
a
mirror
she
glanced
into
the
expression
of
her
face
seemed
to
say
as
she
caught
sight
of
and
very
nice
i
need
a
footman
wanted
to
come
in
to
clear
away
something
in
the
room
but
she
would
not
let
and
having
closed
the
door
behind
him
continued
her
that
morning
she
had
returned
to
her
favorite
and
delight
charming
that
natasha
she
said
speaking
as
some
male
a
good
and
in
way
if
only
they
leave
her
in
but
however
much
they
left
her
in
peace
she
could
not
now
be
at
and
immediately
felt
in
the
hall
the
porch
door
and
someone
and
then
footsteps
were
natasha
was
looking
at
the
but
did
not
see
she
listened
to
the
sounds
in
the
when
she
saw
her
face
was
it
was
she
knew
this
for
though
she
hardly
heard
his
voice
through
the
closed
pale
and
natasha
ran
into
the
drawing
bolkonski
has
she
it
is
it

i
to
be
what
am
i
to
before
the
countess
could
prince
andrew
entered
the
room
with
an
agitated
and
serious
as
soon
as
he
saw
natasha
his
face
he
kissed
the
hand
and
and
sat
down
beside
the
is
long
since
we
had
the
began
the
but
prince
andrew
interrupted
her
by
answering
her

obviously
in
haste
to
say
what

that

and
regardless

she
stared
straight
at
prince
andrew
with
this
it
she
again
he
glanced
at
and
that
glance
convinced
her
that
she
was
not

said
the
countess
in
a
natasha

with

imploring
eyes
at
prince
andrew
and
at
her
mother
and
went
have

prince
replied
the
she
held
out
her
hand
to
and
with
a
mixed
feeling
of
estrangement
and
tenderness
pressed
her
lips
to
his
forehead
as
he
stooped
to
kiss
her
she
wished
to
love
him
as
a
but
felt
that
to
her
he
was
a
stranger
and
a
terrifying

sure
my
husband

said
the
your
to
whom
i
have
told

repeated
while
seeking
her
sonya
said
that
natasha
was
in
her
natasha
was
sitting
on
the
pale
and
dry
and
was
gazing
at
the
icons
and
whispering
something
as
she
rapidly
crossed
seeing
her
mother
she
jumped
up
and
flew
to
go
to
he
is
asking
for
your
said
the
coldly
it
seemed
to
said
the
sadly
and
with
a
deep
as
her
daughter
ran
natasha
never
remembered
how
she
entered
the
drawing
when
she
came
in
and
saw
him
she
it
possible
that
this
stranger
has
now
become
everything
to
she
asked
and
immediately
he
alone
is
now
dearer
to
me
than
everything
in
the
prince
andrew
came
up
to
her
with
downcast
have
loved
you
from
the
very
first
moment
i
saw
may
i
he
looked
at
her
and
was
struck
by
the
serious
impassioned
expression
of
her
her
face
why
doubt
what
you
cannot
but
why
when
words
cannot
express
what
one
she
drew
near
to
him
and
he
took
her
hand
and
kissed
you
love
natasha
murmured
as
if
in
then
she
sighed
loudly
catching
her
breath
more
and
more
began
to
is
the
i
am
so
she
smiled
through
her
bent
over
closer
to
paused
for
an
instant
as
if
asking
herself
whether
she
and
then
kissed
prince
andrew
held
her
looked
into
her
and
did
not
find
in
his
heart
his
former
love
for
something
in
him
had
suddenly
there
was
no
longer
the
former
poetic
and
mystic
charm
of
but
there
was
pity
for
her
feminine
and
childish
fear
at
her
devotion
and
and
an
oppressive
yet
joyful
sense
of
the
duty
that
now
bound
him
to
her
the
present
though
not
so
bright
and
poetic
as
the
was
stronger
and
more
your
mother
tell
you
that
it
cannot
be
for
a
asked
prince
still
looking
into
her
it
possible
that
of
a
as
everybody
called
thought
it
possible
that
i
am
now
to
be
the
wife
and
the
equal
of
this
clever
man
whom
even
my
father
looks
up
can
it
be
can
it
be
true
that
there
can
be
no
more
playing
with
that
now
i
am
grown
that
on
me
now
lies
a
responsibility
for
my
every
word
and
but
what
did

with
concentrated
trying
but
failing
to
take
in
the
meaning
of

this
year
which
delays

happiness

make
me
happy

a
but
you

our
engagement

remain

and
should
you

that
you
do
not
love
or
should
you
come
to
said
prince
andrew
with
an
unnatural
do
you
say
natasha
interrupted
know
that
from
the
very
day
you
first
came
to
otradnoe
i
have
loved
she
quite
convinced
that
she
spoke
the
a
year
you
will
learn
to
know
whole
natasha
repeated
only
now
realizing
that
the
marriage
was
to
be
postponed
for
a
why
a
why
a
prince
andrew
began
to
explain
to
her
the
reasons
for
this
natasha
did
not
hear
it
be
she
prince
andrew
did
not
but
his
face
expressed
the
impossibility
of
altering
that
natasha
suddenly
and
again
burst
into
shall
waiting
a
she
looked
into
her
face
and
saw
in
it
a
look
of
commiseration
and
do
she
suddenly
checking
her
am
so
the
father
and
mother
came
into
the
room
and
gave
the
betrothed
couple
their
from
that
day
prince
andrew
began
to
frequent
the
as
affianced
chapter
xxiv
no
betrothal
ceremony
took
place
and
engagement
to
bolkonski
was
not
prince
andrew
insisted
on
he
said
that
as
he
was
responsible
for
the
delay
he
ought
to
bear
the
whole
burden
of
that
he
had
given
his
word
and
bound
himself
but
that
he
did
not
wish
to
bind
natasha
and
gave
her
perfect
if
after
six
months
she
felt
that
she
did
not
love
him
she
would
have
full
right
to
reject
naturally
neither
natasha
nor
her
parents
wished
to
hear
of
but
prince
andrew
was
he
came
every
day
to
the
but
did
not
behave
to
natasha
as
an
affianced
he
did
not
use
the
familiar
but
said
you
to
and
kissed
only
her
after
their
quite
and
natural
relations
sprang
up
between
it
was
as
if
they
had
not
known
each
other
till
both
liked
to
recall
how
they
had
regarded
each
other
when
as
yet
they
were
nothing
to
one
they
felt
themselves
now
quite
different
then
they
were
now
natural
and
at
first
the
family
felt
some
constraint
in
intercourse
with
prince
he
seemed
a
man
from
another
and
for
a
long
time
natasha
trained
the
family
to
get
used
to
proudly
assuring
them
all
that
he
only
appeared
to
be
but
was
really
just
like
all
of
and
that
she
was
not
afraid
of
him
and
no
one
else
ought
to
after
a
few
days
they
grew
accustomed
to
and
without
restraint
in
his
presence
pursued
their
usual
way
of
in
which
he
took
his
he
could
talk
about
rural
economy
with
the
fashions
with
the
countess
and
and
about
albums
and
fancywork
with
sometimes
the
household
both
among
themselves
and
in
his
presence
expressed
their
wonder
at
how
it
had
all
and
at
the
evident
omens
there
had
been
of
prince
coming
to
otradnoe
and
their
coming
to
and
the
likeness
between
natasha
and
prince
andrew
which
her
nurse
had
noticed
on
his
first
and
encounter
with
nicholas
in
and
many
other
incidents
betokening
that
it
had
to
in
the
house
that
poetic
dullness
and
quiet
reigned
which
always
accompanies
the
presence
of
a
betrothed
often
when
all
sitting
together
everyone
kept
sometimes
the
others
would
get
up
and
go
away
and
the
left
still
remained
they
rarely
spoke
of
their
future
prince
andrew
was
afraid
and
ashamed
to
speak
of
natasha
shared
this
as
she
did
all
his
which
she
constantly
once
she
began
questioning
him
about
his
prince
andrew
as
he
often
did
particularly
liked
it
in
said
that
his
son
would
not
live
with
asked
natasha
in
a
frightened
cannot
take
him
away
from
his
and
i
should
have
loved
said
immediately
guessing
his
i
know
you
wish
to
avoid
any
pretext
for
finding
fault
with
sometimes
the
old
count
would
come
kiss
prince
and
ask
his
advice
about
education
or
the
old
countess
sighed
as
she
looked
at
sonya
was
always
getting
frightened
lest
she
should
be
in
the
way
and
tried
to
find
excuses
for
leaving
them
even
when
they
did
not
wish
when
prince
andrew
spoke
could
tell
a
story
very
natasha
listened
to
him
with
when
she
spoke
she
noticed
with
fear
and
joy
that
he
gazed
attentively
and
scrutinizingly
at
she
asked
herself
in
does
he
look
for
in
he
is
trying
to
discover
something
by
looking
at
what
if
what
he
seeks
in
me
is
not
sometimes
she
fell
into
one
of
the
merry
moods
characteristic
of
and
then
she
particularly
loved
to
hear
and
see
how
prince
andrew
he
seldom
but
when
he
did
he
abandoned
himself
entirely
to
his
and
after
such
a
laugh
she
always
felt
nearer
to
natasha
would
have
been
completely
happy
if
the
thought
of
the
separation
awaiting
her
and
drawing
near
had
not
terrified
just
as
the
mere
thought
of
it
made
him
turn
pale
and
on
the
eve
of
his
departure
from
petersburg
prince
andrew
brought
with
him
who
had
not
been
to
the
once
since
the
pierre
seemed
disconcerted
and
he
was
talking
to
the
and
natasha
sat
down
beside
a
little
chess
table
with
thereby
inviting
prince
andrew
to
come
he
did
have
known
bezukhov
a
long
he
you
like
a
but
very
and
as
usual
when
speaking
of
she
began
to
tell
anecdotes
of
his
some
of
which
had
even
been
invented
about
you
know
i
have
entrusted
him
with
our
i
have
known
him
from
he
has
a
heart
of
i
beg
prince
andrew
said
with
sudden
am
going
away
and
heaven
knows
what
may
you
may
cease
all
i
know
i
am
not
to
say
only
whatever
may
happen
to
you
when
i
am
not
can
trouble
may
prince
andrew
beg
mademoiselle
whatever
may
to
turn
to
him
alone
for
advice
and
he
is
a
most
and
absurd
but
he
has
a
heart
of
neither
her
nor
her
nor
nor
prince
andrew
himself
could
have
foreseen
how
the
separation
from
her
lover
would
act
on
flushed
and
agitated
she
went
about
the
house
all
that
occupied
with
most
trivial
matters
as
if
not
understanding
what
awaited
she
did
not
even
cry
on
taking
he
kissed
her
hand
for
the
last
she
said
in
a
tone
that
made
him
wonder
whether
he
really
ought
not
to
stay
and
which
he
remembered
long
nor
did
she
cry
when
he
was
but
for
several
days
she
sat
in
her
room
taking
no
interest
in
anything
and
only
saying
now
and
why
did
he
go
but
a
fortnight
after
his
to
the
surprise
of
those
around
she
recovered
from
her
mental
sickness
just
as
suddenly
and
became
her
old
self
but
with
a
change
in
her
moral
as
a
child
gets
up
after
a
long
illness
with
a
changed
expression
of
chapter
xxv
during
that
year
after
his
prince
nicholas
health
and
temper
became
much
he
grew
still
more
and
it
was
princess
mary
who
generally
bore
the
brunt
of
his
frequent
fits
of
unprovoked
he
seemed
carefully
to
seek
out
her
tender
spots
so
as
to
torture
her
mentally
as
harshly
as
princess
mary
had
two
passions
and
consequently
two
little
and
these
were
the
favorite
subjects
of
the
attacks
and
whatever
was
spoken
of
he
would
bring
round
to
the
superstitiousness
of
old
or
the
petting
and
spoiling
of
want
to
make
an
old
maid
like
a
prince
andrew
wants
a
son
and
not
an
old
he
would
turning
to
mademoiselle
he
would
ask
her
in
princess
presence
how
she
liked
our
village
priests
and
icons
and
would
joke
about
he
continually
hurt
princess
feelings
and
tormented
but
it
cost
her
no
effort
to
forgive
could
he
be
to
blame
toward
or
could
her
whom
she
knew
loved
her
in
spite
of
it
be
and
what
is
the
princess
never
thought
of
that
proud
word
all
the
complex
laws
of
man
centered
for
her
in
one
clear
and
simple
law
of
love
and
taught
us
by
him
who
lovingly
suffered
for
mankind
though
he
himself
was
what
had
she
to
do
with
the
justice
or
injustice
of
other
she
had
to
endure
and
and
that
she
during
the
winter
prince
andrew
had
come
to
bald
hills
and
had
been
and
more
affectionate
than
princess
mary
had
known
him
for
a
long
time
she
felt
that
something
had
happened
to
but
he
said
nothing
to
her
about
his
before
he
left
he
had
a
long
talk
with
his
father
about
and
princess
mary
noticed
that
before
his
departure
they
were
dissatisfied
with
one
soon
after
prince
andrew
had
princess
mary
wrote
to
her
friend
julie
karagina
in
whom
she
had
dreamed
all
girls
of
marrying
to
her
and
who
was
at
that
time
in
mourning
for
her
own
killed
in
it
is
our
common
my
tender
friend
your
loss
is
so
terrible
that
i
can
only
explain
it
to
myself
as
a
special
providence
of
god
loving
wishes
to
try
you
and
your
excellent
my
and
religion
will
not
say
comfort
save
us
from
religion
alone
can
explain
to
us
what
without
its
help
man
cannot
for
what
kind
and
noble
beings
able
to
find
happiness
in
merely
harming
no
one
but
necessary
to
the
happiness
of
called
away
to
while
harmful
or
such
as
are
a
burden
to
themselves
and
to
are
left
the
first
death
i
and
one
i
shall
never
of
my
dear
that
impression
on
just
as
you
ask
destiny
why
your
splendid
brother
had
to
so
i
asked
why
that
angel
who
not
only
never
wronged
but
in
whose
soul
there
were
never
any
unkind
had
to
and
what
do
you
dear
five
years
have
passed
since
and
already
with
my
petty
begin
to
see
clearly
why
she
had
to
and
in
what
way
that
death
was
but
an
expression
of
the
infinite
goodness
of
the
whose
every
though
generally
incomprehensible
to
is
but
a
manifestation
of
his
infinite
love
for
his
i
often
she
was
too
angelically
innocent
to
have
the
strength
to
perform
all
a
as
a
young
wife
she
was
perhaps
she
could
not
have
been
so
as
a
as
it
not
only
has
she
left
and
particularly
prince
with
the
purest
regrets
and
but
probably
she
will
there
receive
a
place
i
dare
not
hope
for
but
not
to
speak
of
her
that
early
and
terrible
death
has
had
the
most
beneficent
influence
on
me
and
on
my
brother
in
spite
of
all
our
at
the
moment
of
our
these
thoughts
could
not
occur
to
i
should
then
have
dismissed
them
with
but
now
they
are
very
clear
and
i
write
all
this
to
dear
only
to
convince
you
of
the
gospel
truth
which
has
become
for
me
a
principle
of
not
a
single
hair
of
our
heads
will
fall
without
his
and
his
will
is
governed
only
by
infinite
love
for
and
so
whatever
befalls
us
is
for
our
you
ask
whether
we
shall
spend
next
winter
in
in
spite
of
my
wish
to
see
i
do
not
think
so
and
do
not
want
to
do
you
will
be
surprised
to
hear
that
the
reason
for
this
is
the
case
is
my
health
is
growing
noticeably
he
cannot
stand
any
contradiction
and
is
becoming
this
irritability
as
you
chiefly
directed
to
political
he
cannot
endure
the
notion
that
buonaparte
is
negotiating
on
equal
terms
with
all
the
sovereigns
of
europe
and
particularly
with
our
the
grandson
of
the
great
as
you
i
am
quite
indifferent
to
but
from
my
remarks
and
his
talks
with
michael
ivanovich
i
know
all
that
goes
on
in
the
world
and
especially
about
the
honors
conferred
on
who
only
at
bald
hills
in
the
whole
it
is
not
accepted
as
a
great
still
less
as
emperor
of
and
my
father
cannot
stand
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
chiefly
because
of
his
political
views
that
my
father
is
reluctant
to
speak
of
going
to
for
he
foresees
the
encounters
that
would
result
from
his
way
of
expressing
his
views
regardless
of
all
the
benefit
he
might
derive
from
a
course
of
treatment
he
would
lose
as
a
result
of
the
disputes
about
buonaparte
which
would
be
in
any
case
it
will
be
decided
very
our
family
life
goes
on
in
the
old
way
except
for
my
brother
as
i
wrote
you
has
changed
very
much
of
after
his
sorrow
he
only
this
year
quite
recovered
his
he
has
again
become
as
i
used
to
know
him
when
a
with
that
heart
of
gold
to
which
i
know
no
he
has
it
seems
to
that
life
is
not
over
for
but
together
with
this
mental
change
he
has
grown
physically
much
he
has
become
thinner
and
more
i
am
anxious
about
him
and
glad
he
is
taking
this
trip
abroad
which
the
doctors
recommended
long
i
hope
it
will
cure
you
write
that
in
petersburg
he
is
spoken
of
as
one
of
the
most
and
capable
of
the
young
forgive
my
vanity
as
a
but
i
never
doubted
the
good
he
has
done
to
everybody
from
his
peasants
up
to
the
is
on
his
arrival
in
petersburg
he
received
only
his
i
always
wonder
at
the
way
rumors
fly
from
petersburg
to
especially
such
false
ones
as
that
you
write
mean
the
report
of
my
betrothal
to
the
little
i
do
not
think
my
brother
will
ever
marry
and
certainly
not
and
this
is
i
know
that
though
he
rarely
speaks
about
the
wife
he
has
the
grief
of
that
loss
has
gone
too
deep
in
his
heart
for
him
ever
to
decide
to
give
her
a
successor
and
our
little
angel
a
secondly
as
far
as
i
that
girl
is
not
the
kind
of
girl
who
could
please
prince
i
do
not
think
he
would
choose
her
for
a
and
frankly
i
do
not
wish
but
i
am
running
on
too
long
and
am
at
the
end
of
my
second
my
dear
may
god
keep
you
in
his
holy
and
mighty
my
dear
mademoiselle
sends
you
mary
chapter
xxvi
in
the
middle
of
the
summer
princess
mary
received
an
unexpected
letter
from
prince
andrew
in
switzerland
in
which
he
gave
her
strange
and
surprising
he
informed
her
of
his
engagement
to
natasha
the
whole
letter
breathed
loving
rapture
for
his
betrothed
and
tender
and
confiding
affection
for
his
he
wrote
that
he
had
never
loved
as
he
did
now
and
that
only
now
did
he
understand
and
know
what
life
he
asked
his
sister
to
forgive
him
for
not
having
told
her
of
his
resolve
when
he
had
last
visited
bald
though
he
had
spoken
of
it
to
his
he
had
not
done
so
for
fear
princess
mary
should
ask
her
father
to
give
his
irritating
him
and
having
to
bear
the
brunt
of
his
displeasure
without
attaining
her
he
matter
was
not
then
so
definitely
settled
as
it
is
my
father
then
insisted
on
a
delay
of
a
year
and
now
already
six
half
of
that
have
and
my
resolution
is
firmer
than
if
the
doctors
did
not
keep
me
here
at
the
spas
i
should
be
back
in
but
as
it
is
i
have
to
postpone
my
return
for
three
you
know
me
and
my
relations
with
i
want
nothing
from
i
have
been
and
always
shall
be
but
to
go
against
his
will
and
arouse
his
now
that
he
may
perhaps
remain
with
us
such
a
short
would
destroy
half
my
i
am
now
writing
to
him
about
the
same
and
beg
you
to
choose
a
good
moment
to
hand
him
the
letter
and
to
let
me
know
how
he
looks
at
the
whole
matter
and
whether
there
is
hope
that
he
may
consent
to
reduce
the
term
by
four
after
long
and
princess
mary
gave
the
letter
to

into
the
the
the
after
this
outburst
the
prince
did
not
speak
any
more
about
the
but
repressed
vexation
at
his
behavior
found
expression
in
his
treatment
of
his
to
his
former
pretexts
for
irony
a
fresh
one
was
now
to
stepmothers
and
amiabilities
to
mademoiselle
i
marry
he
asked
his
make
a
splendid
and
to
her
surprise
and
princess
mary
noticed
that
her
father
was
really
associating
more
and
more
with
the
she
wrote
to
prince
andrew
about
the
reception
of
his
but
comforted
him
with
hopes
of
reconciling
their
father
to
the
little
nicholas
and
his
her
brother
and
religion
were
princess
joys
and
but
besides
since
everyone
must
have
personal
princess
mary
in
the
profoundest
depths
of
her
heart
had
a
hidden
dream
and
hope
that
supplied
the
chief
consolation
of
her
this
comforting
dream
and
hope
were
given
her
by
the
and
other
pilgrims
who
visited
her
without
the
the
longer
she
the
more
experience
and
observation
she
had
of
the
greater
was
her
wonder
at
the
of
men
who
seek
enjoyment
and
happiness
here
on
and
harming
one
to
obtain
that
sinful
prince
andrew
had
loved
his
she
but
that
was
not
he
wanted
to
bind
his
happiness
to
another
her
father
objected
to
this
because
he
wanted
a
more
distinguished
and
wealthier
match
for
and
they
all
struggled
and
suffered
and
tormented
one
another
and
injured
their
their
eternal
for
the
attainment
of
benefits
which
endure
but
for
an
not
only
do
we
know
this
but
the
son
of
came
down
to
earth
and
told
us
that
this
life
is
but
for
a
moment
and
is
a
yet
we
cling
to
it
and
think
to
find
happiness
in
is
it
that
no
one
realizes

except
these
despised
folk

to
me
by
the
back
afraid
of
being
seen
by
the
not
for
fear
of
by
him
but
for
fear
of
causing
him
to
to
leave
and
all
the
cares
of
worldly
in
order
without
clinging
to
anything
to
wander
in
hempen
rags
from
place
to
place
under
an
assumed
doing
no
one
any
harm
but
praying
for
those
who
drive
one
away
as
well
as
for
those
who
protect
higher
than
that
life
and
truth
there
is
no
life
or
there
was
one
a
quiet
pockmarked
little
woman
of
fifty
called
who
for
over
thirty
years
had
gone
about
barefoot
and
worn
heavy
princess
mary
was
particularly
fond
of
when
in
a
room
with
a
lamp
dimly
lit
before
the
icon
theodosia
was
talking
of
her
the
thought
that
theodosia
alone
had
found
the
true
path
of
life
suddenly
came
to
princess
mary
with
such
force
that
she
resolved
to
become
a
pilgrim
when
theodosia
had
gone
to
sleep
princess
mary
thought
about
this
for
a
long
and
at
last
made
up
her
mind
strange
as
it
might
she
must
go
on
a
she
disclosed
this
thought
to
no
one
but
to
her
father
the
and
he
approved
of
her
under
guise
of
a
present
for
the
princess
mary
prepared
a
complete
costume
for
a
coarse
bast
a
rough
and
a
black
approaching
the
chest
of
drawers
containing
this
secret
princess
mary
uncertain
whether
the
time
had
not
already
come
to
put
her
project
into
listening
to
the
she
was
so
stimulated
by
their
simple
mechanical
to
them
but
to
her
so
full
of
deep
that
several
times
she
was
on
the
point
of
abandoning
everything
and
running
away
from
in
imagination
she
already
pictured
herself
by
dressed
in
coarse
walking
with
a
a
wallet
on
her
along
the
dusty
directing
her
wanderings
from
one
shrine
to
free
from
earthly
or
and
reaching
at
last
the
place
where
there
is
no
more
sorrow
or
but
eternal
joy
and
shall
come
to
a
place
and
pray
and
before
having
time
to
get
used
to
it
or
getting
to
love
i
shall
go
i
will
go
on
till
my
legs
and
lie
down
and
die
and
shall
at
last
reach
that
quiet
where
there
is
neither
sorrow
nor
thought

but
when
she
saw
her
father
and
especially
little
koko

she
wept
and
felt
that
she
was
a
sinner
who
loved

and
little
nephew

11
chapter
i
the
bible
legend
tells
us
that
the
absence
of
a
condition
of
the
first
blessedness
before
the
fallen
man
has
retained
a
love
of
but
the
curse
weighs
on
the
race
not
only
because
we
have
to
seek
our
bread
in
the
sweat
of
our
but
because
our
moral
nature
is
such
that
we
cannot
be
both
idle
and
at
an
inner
voice
tells
us
we
are
in
the
wrong
if
we
are
if
man
could
find
a
state
in
which
he
felt
that
though
idle
he
was
fulfilling
his
he
would
have
found
one
of
the
conditions
of
primitive
and
such
a
state
of
obligatory
and
irreproachable
idleness
is
the
lot
of
a
whole
the
chief
attraction
of
military
service
has
consisted
and
will
consist
in
this
compulsory
and
irreproachable
nicholas
rostov
experienced
this
blissful
condition
to
the
full
after
he
continued
to
serve
in
the
pavlograd
in
which
he
already
commanded
the
squadron
he
had
taken
over
from
rostov
had
become
a
whom
his
moscow
acquaintances
would
have
considered
rather
bad
but
who
was
liked
and
respected
by
his
and
and
was
well
contented
with
his
of
in
he
found
in
letters
from
home
more
frequent
complaints
from
his
mother
that
their
affairs
were
falling
into
greater
and
greater
and
that
it
was
time
for
him
to
come
back
to
gladden
and
comfort
his
old
reading
these
nicholas
felt
a
dread
of
their
wanting
to
take
him
away
from
surroundings
in
protected
from
all
the
entanglements
of
he
was
living
so
calmly
and
he
felt
that
sooner
or
later
he
would
have
to
that
whirlpool
of
with
its
embarrassments
and
affairs
to
be
straightened
its
accounts
with
and
its
and
with
love
and
his
promise
to
it
was
all
dreadfully
difficult
and
and
he
replied
to
his
mother
in
formal
letters
in
dear
and
obedient
which
said
nothing
of
when
he
would
in
1810
he
received
letters
from
his
in
which
they
told
him
of
engagement
to
and
that
the
wedding
would
be
in
a
time
because
the
old
prince
made
this
letter
grieved
and
mortified
in
the
first
place
he
was
sorry
that
for
whom
he
cared
more
than
for
anyone
else
in
the
should
be
lost
to
the
and
from
his
hussar
point
of
he
regretted
not
to
have
been
there
to
show
that
fellow
bolkonski
that
connection
with
him
was
no
such
great
honor
after
and
that
if
he
loved
natasha
he
might
dispense
with
permission
from
his
dotard
for
a
moment
he
hesitated
whether
he
should
not
apply
for
leave
in
order
to
see
natasha
before
she
was
but
then
came
the
and
considerations
about
sonya
and
about
the
confusion
of
their
and
nicholas
again
put
it
but
in
the
spring
of
that
he
received
a
letter
from
his
written
without
his
and
that
letter
persuaded
him
to
she
wrote
that
if
he
did
not
come
and
take
matters
in
their
whole
property
would
be
sold
by
auction
and
they
would
all
have
to
go
the
count
was
so
and
trusted
mitenka
so
and
was
so
that
everybody
took
advantage
of
him
and
things
were
going
from
bad
to
i
implore
come
at
once
if
you
do
not
wish
to
make
me
and
the
whole
family
wrote
the
this
letter
touched
he
had
that
common
sense
of
a
fact
man
which
showed
him
what
he
ought
to
the
right
thing
now
if
not
to
retire
from
the
at
any
rate
to
go
home
on
why
he
had
to
go
he
did
not
but
after
his
nap
he
gave
orders
to
saddle
an
extremely
vicious
gray
stallion
that
had
not
been
ridden
for
a
long
and
when
he
returned
with
the
horse
all
in
a
he
informed
lavrushka
servant
who
had
remained
with
and
his
comrades
who
turned
up
in
the
evening
that
he
was
applying
for
leave
and
was
going
difficult
and
strange
as
it
was
for
him
to
reflect
that
he
would
go
away
without
having
heard
from
the
this
interested
him
he
was
promoted
to
a
captaincy
or
would
receive
the
order
of
anne
for
the
last
strange
as
it
was
to
think
that
he
would
go
away
without
having
sold
his
three
roans
to
the
polish
count
who
was
bargaining
for
the
horses
rostov
had
betted
he
would
sell
for
two
thousand
incomprehensible
as
it
seemed
that
the
ball
the
hussars
were
giving
in
honor
of
the
polish
mademoiselle
przazdziecka
of
rivalry
to
the
uhlans
who
had
given
one
in
honor
of
their
polish
mademoiselle
would
take
place
without
knew
he
must
go
away
from
this
bright
world
to
somewhere
where
everything
was
stupid
and
a
week
later
he
obtained
his
his
hussar
only
those
of
his
own
but
the
whole
rostov
a
dinner
to
which
the
subscription
was
fifteen
rubles
a
and
at
which
there
were
two
bands
and
two
choirs
of
rostov
danced
the
trepak
with
major
the
tipsy
officers
and
dropped
the
soldiers
of
the
third
squadron
tossed
him
and
shouted
and
then
they
put
him
in
his
sleigh
and
escorted
him
as
far
as
the
first
post
during
the
first
half
of
the
kremenchug
to
as
is
usual
in
such
were
behind
with
the
but
when
he
had
gone
more
than
halfway
he
began
to
forget
his
three
roans
and
his
and
to
wonder
anxiously
how
things
would
be
at
otradnoe
and
what
he
would
find
thoughts
of
home
grew
stronger
the
nearer
he
approached
as
though
this
feeling
of
his
was
subject
to
the
law
by
which
the
force
of
attraction
is
in
inverse
proportion
to
the
square
of
the
at
the
last
post
station
before
otradnoe
he
gave
the
driver
a
and
on
arriving
he
ran
like
a
up
the
steps
of
his
after
the
rapture
of
and
after
that
odd
feeling
of
unsatisfied
feeling
that
is
just
the
so
why
did
i
began
to
settle
down
in
his
old
home
his
father
and
mother
were
much
the
only
a
little
what
was
new
in
them
was
a
certain
uneasiness
and
occasional
which
there
used
not
to
and
as
nicholas
soon
found
was
due
to
the
bad
state
of
their
sonya
was
nearly
she
had
stopped
growing
prettier
and
promised
nothing
more
than
she
was
but
that
was
she
exhaled
happiness
and
love
from
the
time
nicholas
and
the
unalterable
love
of
this
girl
had
a
gladdening
effect
on
petya
and
natasha
surprised
nicholas
petya
was
a
big
handsome
boy
of
and
with
a
voice
that
was
already
as
for
for
a
long
while
nicholas
wondered
and
laughed
whenever
he
looked
at
not
the
same
at
he
am
i
the
but
what
a
he
whispered
to
cried
she
told
him
about
her
romance
with
prince
andrew
and
of
his
visit
to
otradnoe
and
showed
him
his
last
are
you
natasha
am
so
tranquil
and
happy
answered
is
an
excellent
and
are
you
very
much
in
shall
i
put
replied
was
in
love
with
with
my
and
with
but
this
is
quite
i
feel
at
peace
and
i
know
that
no
better
man
than
he
and
i
am
calm
and
contented
not
at
all
as
nicholas
expressed
his
disapproval
of
the
postponement
of
the
marriage
for
a
but
natasha
attacked
her
brother
with
proving
to
him
that
it
could
not
be
and
that
it
would
be
a
bad
thing
to
enter
a
family
against
the
and
that
she
herself
wished
it
at
all
she
nicholas
was
silent
and
agreed
with
her
brother
often
wondered
as
he
looked
at
she
did
not
seem
at
all
like
a
girl
in
love
and
parted
from
her
affianced
she
was
tempered
and
calm
and
quite
as
cheerful
as
of
this
amazed
nicholas
and
even
made
him
regard
courtship
he
could
not
believe
that
her
fate
was
especially
as
he
had
not
seen
her
with
prince
it
always
seemed
to
him
that
there
was
something
not
quite
right
about
this
intended
this
why
no
he
when
he
had
touched
on
this
topic
with
his
he
to
his
surprise
and
somewhat
to
his
that
in
the
depth
of
her
soul
she
too
had
doubts
about
this
see
he
said
showing
her
son
a
letter
of
prince
with
that
latent
grudge
a
mother
always
has
in
regard
to
a
future
married
writes
that
he
come
before
what
can
be
keeping
his
health
is
very
tell
and
attach
importance
to
her
being
so
because
living
through
the
last
days
of
her
but
i
know
what
she
is
like
every
time
we
receive
a
letter
from
god
grant
that
everything
turns
out
always
ended
with
these
is
an
excellent
chapter
ii
after
reaching
home
nicholas
was
at
first
serious
and
even
he
was
worried
by
the
impending
necessity
of
interfering
in
the
stupid
business
matters
for
which
his
mother
had
called
him
to
throw
off
this
burden
as
quickly
as
on
the
third
day
after
his
arrival
he
angry
and
scowling
and
without
answering
questions
as
to
where
he
was
to
lodge
and
demanded
an
account
of
but
what
an
account
of
everything
might
be
nicholas
knew
even
less
than
the
frightened
and
bewildered
the
conversation
and
the
examination
of
the
accounts
with
mitenka
did
not
last
the
village
a
peasant
and
the
village
who
were
waiting
in
the
heard
with
fear
and
delight
first
the
young
voice
roaring
and
snapping
and
rising
louder
and
and
then
words
of
dreadful
ejaculated
one
after
the
ungrateful
hack
the
dog
to
not
my
robbing
and
so
then
with
no
less
fear
and
delight
they
saw
how
the
young
red
in
the
face
and
with
bloodshot
dragged
mitenka
out
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
and
applied
his
foot
and
knee
to
his
behind
with
great
agility
at
convenient
moments
between
the
never
let
me
see
your
face
here
you
mitenka
flew
headlong
down
the
six
steps
and
ran
away
into
the
shrubbery
was
a
haven
of
refuge
for
culprits
at
mitenka
returning
tipsy
from
the
used
to
hide
and
many
of
the
residents
at
hiding
from
knew
of
its
protective
wife
and
thrust
their
heads
and
frightened
faces
out
of
the
door
of
a
room
where
a
bright
samovar
was
boiling
and
where
the
high
bedstead
stood
with
its
patchwork
the
young
count
paid
no
heed
to
breathing
passed
by
with
resolute
strides
and
went
into
the
the
who
heard
at
once
from
the
maids
what
had
happened
at
the
was
calmed
by
the
thought
that
now
their
affairs
would
certainly
but
on
the
other
hand
felt
anxious
as
to
the
effect
this
excitement
might
have
on
her
she
went
several
times
to
his
door
on
tiptoe
and
as
he
lighted
one
pipe
after
next
day
the
old
count
called
his
son
aside
with
an
embarrassed
said
to
you
my
dear
a
pity
you
got
mitenka
has
told
me
all
about
thought
i
should
never
understand
anything
in
this
crazy
were
angry
that
he
had
not
entered
those
700
but
they
were
carried
you
did
not
look
at
the
other
he
is
a
blackguard
and
a
i
know
he
and
what
i
have
i
have
if
you
i
speak
to
him
my
dear
felt
he
knew
he
had
mismanaged
his
property

the
weather
was
already
growing
wintry
and
morning
frosts
congealed
an
earth
saturated
by
autumn
the
verdure
had
thickened
and
its
bright
green
stood
out
sharply
against
the
brownish
strips
of
winter
rye
trodden
down
by
the
and
against
the
stubble
of
the
spring
the
wooded
ravines

the
which
at
the
end
of

had
still
been

become
golden

amid
the
green
winter
the

had
already
half
changed
their
summer
the
fox
cubs
were
beginning
to

the
young

were
bigger

the
best
time
of

for

ardent
young
sportsman
rostov
had
not
merely
reached
hard
winter
but
were
so
jaded
that
at
a
meeting
of
the
huntsmen
it
was
decided
to
give
them
a
three
rest
and
on
the
sixteenth
of
to
go
on
a
distant
starting
from
the
oak
grove
where
there
was
an
undisturbed
litter
of
wolf
all
that
day
the
hounds
remained
at
it
was
frosty
and
the
air
was
but
toward
evening
the
sky
became
overcast
and
it
began
to
on
the
when
young
in
his
dressing
looked
out
of
the
he
saw
it
was
an
unsurpassable
morning
for
it
was
as
if
the
sky
were
melting
and
sinking
to
the
earth
without
any
the
only
motion
in
the
air
was
that
of
the
microscopic
particles
of
drizzling
the
bare
twigs
in
the
garden
were
hung
with
transparent
drops
which
fell
on
the
freshly
fallen
the
earth
in
the
kitchen
garden
looked
wet
and
black
and
glistened
like
poppy
seed
and
at
a
short
distance
merged
into
the
moist
veil
of
nicholas
went
out
into
the
wet
and
muddy
there
was
a
smell
of
decaying
leaves
and
of
a
bitch
with
prominent
black
got
up
on
seeing
her
stretched
her
hind
lay
down
like
a

then
suddenly
jumped
up
and
licked
him
right
on
his
nose
and
another
a
catching
sight
of
his
master
from
the
garden
arched
his
back
rushing
headlong
toward
the
porch
with
lifted

rubbing
himself
against
his

at
that
that
inimitable
call
which
unites
the
deepest
bass
with
the
shrillest
and
round
the
corner
came
daniel
the
head
huntsman
and
head
a
wrinkled
old
man
with
hair
cut
straight
over
his
ukrainian
a
long
bent
whip
in
his
and
that
look
of
independence
and
scorn
of
everything
that
is
only
seen
in
he
doffed
his
circassian
cap
to
his
master
and
looked
at
him
this
scorn
was
not
offensive
to
his
nicholas
knew
that
this
disdainful
of
everybody
and
who
considered
himself
above
was
all
the
same
his
serf
and
nicholas
said
conscious
at
the
sight
of
the
the
and
the
huntsman
that
he
was
being
carried
away
by
that
irresistible
passion
for
sport
which
makes
a
man
forget
all
his
previous
as
a
lover
forgets
in
the
presence
of

in
his
deep

flashing
black

of

as

stood
just
inside

not

in

he
hastened
to

necessary
so
as
to

not

of

moments

broke
apart

both
were
becoming

in
full
cry

galloped
toward
the
the

galloped
out

to

were

and
getting
free

rushed
past
the
feet
at

its
heavy
forehead
toward
the
dogs
like
a
man
suffering
from

still
slightly
swaying

a
couple
of
leaps

with
a
swish
of
its
tail
disappeared
into

skirt
of

a
cry
like
a
first
one
then
and
then
sprang
from
the
wood
opposite

the
whole
pack
rushed
across
the
field
toward
the
very
spot
where
the
wolf

meanwhile
remained
at
his
waiting
for
the
by
the
way
the
hunt
approached
and
by
the
cries
of
the
dogs
whose
notes
were
familiar
to
by
the
way
the
voices
of
the
huntsmen
and
he
realized
what
was
happening
at
the
he
knew
that
young
and
old
wolves
were
that
the
hounds
had
separated
into
two
that
somewhere
a
wolf
was
being
and
that
something
had
gone
he
expected
the
wolf
to
come
his
way
any
he
made
thousands
of
different
conjectures
as
to
where
and
from
what
side
the
beast
would
come
and
how
he
would
set
upon
hope
alternated
with
several
times
he
addressed
a
prayer
to
god
that
the
wolf
should
come
his
he
prayed
with
that
passionate
and
shamefaced
feeling
with
which
men
pray
at
moments
of
great
excitement
arising
from
trivial
would
it
be
to
thee
to
do
this
for
he
said
to
know
thou
art
and
that
it
is
a
sin
to
ask
this
of
but
for
sake
do
let
the
old
wolf
come
my
way
and
let
karay
spring
at
sight
of
who
is
watching
from
over
seize
it
by
the

in
a

looked

running

taking
a

as

of

heavily
over
a
gully
that
lay
in

probably
never

fixed
upon
turning

a
little
toward

or
no
the

seemed
to
say
to
and
she
moved
forward
without
again
looking
round
and
with
a
easy
yet
resolute
cried
in
a
voice
not

and
of
its
own
accord
his
good
horse
darted
headlong
leaping
over
gullies
to
head
off

passed

did
not

he

on

along

into

was
with
her
black
markings
and
powerful
gaining
upon

and
now
she
was
ahead
of

the
wolf
turned
its
head
to
face
and
instead
of
putting
on
speed
as
she
usually
did
milka
suddenly
raised
her
tail
and
stiffened
her
shouted
the
reddish
lyubim
rushed
forward
from
behind
sprang
impetuously
at
the
and
seized
it
by
its
but
immediately
jumped
aside
in
the
wolf
gnashed
her
and
again
rose
and
bounded
followed
at
the
distance
of
a
couple
of
feet
by
all
the
who
did
not
get
any
closer
to
get

still
shouting
with
a
hoarse
he
looking
round
for
the
old
borzoi
who
was
now
his
only
with
all
the
strength
age
had
left
stretched
himself
to
the
utmost
watching
the
galloped
heavily
aside
to
intercept
but
the
quickness
of
the
lope
and
the
slower
pace
made
it
plain
that
karay
had
nicholas
could
already
see
not
far
in
front
of
him
the
wood
where
the
wolf
would
certainly
escape
should
she
reach
coming
toward
he
saw
hounds
and
a
huntsman
galloping
almost
straight
at
the
there
was
still
a
yellowish
young
one
nicholas
did
not
from
another
rushed
impetuously
at
the
wolf
from
in
front
and
almost
knocked
her
but
the
wolf
jumped
up
more
quickly
than
anyone
could
have
expected
gnashing
her
flew
at
the
yellowish
with
a
piercing
fell
with
its
head
on
the
bleeding
from
a
gash
in
its
old
wailed
thanks
to
the
delay
caused
by
this
crossing
of
the
the
old
dog
with
its
felted
hair
hanging
from
its
thigh
was
within
five
paces
of
as
if
aware
of
her
the
wolf
turned
her
eyes
on
tucked
her
tail
yet
further
between
her
and
increased
her
but
here
nicholas
only
saw
that
something
happened
to
borzoi
was
suddenly
on
the
and
they
rolled
together
down
into
a
gully
just
in
front
of
that
when
nicholas
saw
the
wolf
struggling
in
the
gully
with
the
while
from
under
them
could
be
seen
her
gray
hair
and
outstretched
hind
leg
and
her
frightened
choking
with
her
ears
laid
back
was
pinning
her
by
the
was
the
happiest
moment
of
his
with
his
hand
on
his
he
was
ready
to
dismount
and
stab
the
when
she
suddenly
thrust
her
head
up
from
among
that
mass
of
and
then
her
forepaws
were
on
the
edge
of
the
she
clicked
her
teeth
no
longer
had
her
by
the
leaped
with
a
movement
of
her
hind
legs
out
of
the
and
having
disengaged
herself
from
the
with
tail
tucked
in
went
his
hair
and
probably
bruised
or
climbed
with
difficulty
out
of
the
my
nicholas
cried
in
huntsman
was
galloping
from
the
other
side
across
the
path
and
his
borzois
once
more
stopped
the
she
was
again
hemmed
nicholas
and
his
with
and
his
were
all
riding
round
the
crying
shouting
and
preparing
to
dismount
each
moment
that
the
wolf
crouched
and
starting
forward
again
every
time
she
shook
herself
and
moved
toward
the
wood
where
she
would
be
at
the
beginning
of
this
hearing
the
had
rushed
out
from
the
he
saw
karay
seize
the
and
checked
his
supposing
the
affair
to
be
but
when
he
saw
that
the
horsemen
did
not
dismount
and
that
the
wolf
shook
herself
and
ran
for
daniel
set
his
chestnut
not
at
the
wolf
but
straight
toward
the
just
as
karay
had
run
to
cut
the
animal
as
a
result
of
he
galloped
up
to
the
wolf
just
when
she
had
been
stopped
a
second
time
by
daniel
galloped
up
holding
a
naked
dagger
in
his
left
hand
and
thrashing
the
laboring
sides
of
his
chestnut
horse
with
his
whip
as
if
it
were
a
nicholas
neither
saw
nor
heard
daniel
until
the
breathing
panted
past
and
he
heard
the
fall
of
a
body
and
saw
daniel
lying
on
the
back
among
the
trying
to
seize
her
by
the
it
was
evident
to
the
the
and
to
the
wolf
herself
that
all
was
now
the
terrified
wolf
pressed
back
her
ears
and
tried
to
but
the
borzois
stuck
to
daniel
rose

with
his
whole
as

daniel

changing
his

his
foot
on

a
stick
was
thrust
between
her
jaws
and
she
was
fastened
with
a
as
if
her
legs
were
bound

daniel
rolled
her
over
once
or
twice
from
side
to

laid
the

on
a
shying
and
snorting
horse
accompanied
by
the
dogs

at

her
to
the
place
where
they
were
all
to
the
hounds
had
killed
two
of
the
cubs
and
the
borzois
the
huntsmen
assembled
with
their
booty
and
their
and
all
came
to
look
at
the
with
her
head
hanging
down
and
the
bitten
stick
between
her
gazed
with
great
glassy
eyes
at
this
crowd
of
dogs
and
men
surrounding
when
she
was
she
jerked
her
bound
legs
and
looked
wildly
yet
simply
at

count

also
rode
up
and
touched
the
what
a
formidable
said

he
asked
who
was
standing
your

quickly
doffing
his
the
count
remembered
the
wolf
he
had
let
slip
and
his
encounter
with

you
are

crusty
said
the
for

reply
daniel
gave
him
a
and
amiable
chapter
vi
the
old
count
went
and
natasha
and
petya
promised
to
return
very
but
as
it
was
still
early
the
hunt
went
at
midday
they
put
the
hounds
into
a
ravine
thickly
overgrown
with
young
nicholas
standing
in
a
fallow
field
could
see
all
his
facing
him
lay
a
field
of
winter
there
his
own
huntsman
stood
alone
in
a
hollow
behind
a
hazel
the
hounds
had
scarcely
been
loosed
before
nicholas
heard
one
he
giving
tongue
at
other
hounds
joined
now
pausing
and
now
again
giving
a
moment
later
he
heard
a
cry
from
the
wooded
ravine
that
a
fox
had
been
and
the
whole
joining
rushed
along
the
ravine
toward
the
ryefield
and
away
from
he
saw
the
whips
in
their
red
caps
galloping
along
the
edge
of
the
he
even
saw
the
and
was
expecting
a
fox
to
show
itself
at
any
moment
on
the
ryefield
the
huntsman
standing
in
the
hollow
moved
and
loosed
his
and
nicholas
saw
a
red
fox
with
a
fine
brush
going
hard
across
the
the
borzois
bore
down
on
now
they
drew
close
to
the
fox
which
began
to
dodge
between
the
field
in
sharper
and
sharper
trailing
its
when
suddenly
a
strange
white
borzoi
dashed
in
followed
by
a
black
and
everything
was
in
the
borzois
formed
a
scarcely
swaying
their
bodies
and
with
tails
turned
away
from
the
center
of
the
two
huntsmen
galloped
up
to
the
one
in
a
red

stayed
there
a
long
time
without
strapping
it
to
the

bridled
and
with
high
stood
near
them
and
there
too
the
dogs
were
the
huntsmen
waved
their
arms
and
did
something
to
the
then
from
that
spot
came
the
sound
of

of

the

to

rode
at
a
footpace
to
the
place
where
the
whips
were
getting

of
the
field
galloped
to
the
spot
where
the
fight
was
going

with

and
who
had
ridden
stopped
near
the
waiting
to
see
how
the
matter
would
out
of
the
bushes
came
the
huntsman
who
had
been
fighting
and
rode
toward
his
young
with
the
fox
tied
to
his
while
still
at
a
distance
he
took
off
his
cap
and
tried
to
speak
but
he
was
pale
and
breathless
and
his
face
was
one
of
his
eyes

he
probably
was

his
sister

petya

the
most
resolute
and
desperate
steps
to
punish

passed
an
angle
of

a

riding
toward

handsome

said
he
much
regretted
what

would
have
the

punished

allowed
himself
to
seize

searching
uneasily
for

to

struck
by
the
beauty

excited
by
the
huntsman

halfway
up
the
knoll
holding
up
his
whip
and
the
gentlefolk
rode
up
to
him
at
a
the
hounds
that
were
far
off
on
the
horizon
turned
away
from
the
and
the
but
not

also
moved
all
were
moving
slowly
and

it
asked

paces

before

scenting
the
frost
coming
next
was
unable
to
rest
and
leaped
the
pack
on
leash
rushed
downhill
in
full
cry
after
the
and
from
all
sides
the
borzois
that
were
not
on
leash
darted
after
the
hounds
and
the
all
the
who
had
been
moving
calling
in
the
while
the
borzoi
with
a
cry
of
galloped
across
the
field
setting
the
borzois
on
the
the
tranquil
and
reckless
of
where
and
how
they
seeing
only
the
borzois
and
the
hare
and
fearing
only
to
lose
sight
even
for
an
instant
of
the
the
hare
they
had
started
was
a
strong
and
swift
when
he
jumped
up
he
did
not
run
at
but
pricked
his
ears
listening
to
the
shouting
and
trampling
that
resounded
from
all
sides
at
he
took
a
dozen
not
very
letting
the
borzois
gain
on
finally
having
chosen
his
direction
and
realized
his
laid
back
his
ears
and
rushed
off
he
had
been
lying
in
the
but
in
front
of
him
was
the
autumn
sowing
where
the
ground
was
the
two
borzois
of
the
huntsman
who
had
sighted
having
been
the
were
the
first
to
see
and
pursue
but
they
had
not
gone
far
before
erza
passed
got
within
a
flew
at
the
hare
with
terrible
swiftness
aiming
at
his
thinking
she
had
seized
rolled
over
like
a
the
hare
arched
his
back
and
bounded
off
yet
more
from
behind
erza
rushed
the
milka
and
began
rapidly
gaining
on
the
rose
triumphant
it
looked
as
if
milka
would
immediately
pounce
on
the
but
she
overtook
him
and
flew
the
hare
had
again
the
beautiful
erza
reached
but
when
close
to
the
scut
paused
as
if
measuring
the
so
as
not
to
make
a
mistake
this
time
but
seize
his
hind
ilagin
wailed
in
a
voice
unlike
his
erza
did
not
hearken
to
his
at
the
very
moment
when
she
would
have
seized
her
the
hare
moved
and
darted
along
the
balk
between
the
winter
rye
and
the
again
erza
and
milka
were
running
like
a
pair
of
carriage
and
began
to
overtake
the
but
it
was
easier
for
the
hare
to
run
on
the
balk
and
the
borzois
did
not
overtake
him
so
come
came
a
third
voice
just
and
red
straining
and
curving
its
caught
up
with
the
two
foremost
pushed
ahead
of
them
regardless
of
the
terrible

close
to
the
knocked
it
off
the
balk
onto
the
again
put
on
speed
still
more
sinking
to
his
knees
in
the
muddy
and
all
one
could
see
was
muddying
his
he
rolled
over
with
the
a
ring
of
borzois
surrounded
a
moment
later
everyone
had
drawn
up
round
the
crowd
of
only
the
delighted
and
cut
off
a
shaking
the
hare
for
the
blood
to
drip
and
anxiously
glancing
round
with
restless
eyes
while
his
arms
and
legs
he
spoke
without
himself
knowing
whom
to
or
what
come
a
it
has
beaten
them
the
as
well
as
the
come
said
panting
and
looking
wrathfully
around
as
if
he
were
abusing
as
if
they
were
all
his
enemies
and
had
insulted
and
only
now
had
he
at
last
succeeded
in
justifying

down
three
times

regardless
of
whether

what

there
in
running
across

she
had
missed
it
and
turned

any

saying
at
the

breathless
from
his
gallop
and
his
at
the
same
moment
without
drawing
screamed
and
so
piercingly
that
it
set
ear
by
that
shriek
she
expressed
what
the
others
expressed
by
all
talking
at
and
it
was
so
strange
that
she
must
herself
have
been
ashamed
of
so
wild
a
cry
and
everyone
else
would
have
been
amazed
at
it

an
air
of
not
wishing
to
speak
to

his
bay
and
rode
the
others
all
dispirited
and
and
only
much
later
were
they
able
to
regain
their
former
affectation
of
for
a
long
time
they
continued
to
look
at

arched
back
spattered
with
mud
and
clanking
the
ring
of
his

along
just
behind

with
the
serene
air
of
a
i

any
other
dog

long
as

question
of

when

began
talking

flattered

deigned
to

vii
toward
evening
ilagin
took
leave
of
who
found
that
they
were
so
far
from

out
from

the
curiosity

such
a
degree

many
of

came
up

in

unabashed
by
her
presence
made
remarks
about
her
as
though

his
little
wooden
house
which
stood
in
the
midst
of
an
overgrown
garden

a
glance
at
his

authoritatively
that
the
superfluous
ones
should
take
themselves
off
and
that
all
necessary
preparations

be
made
to

off

the

through
the
anteroom
into
a
small
hall
with
a
folding

into
the
drawing
room
with
a
round
birchwood
table
and
a

finally
into
his
private
room

there
was
a
tattered
a
worn
and
portraits
of
of
the
father

and
of
himself
in
military
the
study

strongly
of
tobacco
and
asked
his
visitors
to
sit
down
and
make
themselves
at
and
then
went
out
of
the
his
back
still
came
into
the
room
and
lay
down
on
the
cleaning
himself
with
his
tongue
and
leading
from
the
study
was
a
passage
in
which
a
partition
with
ragged
curtains
could
be
from

took
off

they
looked
at

that
the
hunt
was
over

they
were
in

longer

it
necessary
to
show
his
manly
superiority
over

him
a
and
neither
refrained
long
from
bursting
into
a
peal
of
ringing
laughter
even
before
they
had
a
pretext
ready
to
account
for
after
a
while
came
in
a
cossack
blue
and
small
top
and
natasha
felt
that
this
the
very
one
she
had
regarded
with
surprise
and
amusement
at
was
just
the
right
thing
and
not
at
all
worse
than
a
or
frock
too
was
in
high
spirits
and
far
from
being
offended
by
the
and
laughter
could
never
enter
his
head
that
they
might
be
laughing
at
his
way
of
he
himself
joined
in
the
young
come
i
never
saw
anyone
like
said
offering
nicholas
a
pipe
with
a
long
stem
with
a
practiced
motion
of
three
taking
down
another
that
had
been
cut
ridden
all
day
like
a
and
is
as
fresh
as
soon
after
reappearance
the
door
was
evidently
from
the
sound
by
a
barefooted
and
a
woman
of
about
with
a
double
chin
and
full
red
entered
carrying
a
large
loaded
with
hospitable
dignity
and
cordiality
in
her
glance
and
in
every
she
looked
at
the
visitors
with
a
pleasant
bowed
in
spite
of
her
exceptional
which
caused
her
to
protrude
her
chest
and
stomach
and
throw
back
her
this
woman
was
trod
very
she
went
to
the
set
down
the
and
with
her
plump
white
hands
deftly
took
from
it
the
bottles
and
various
hors
and
dishes
and
arranged
them
on
the
when
she
had
she
stepped
aside
and
stopped
at
the
door
with
a
smile
on
her
i
i
am
now
do
you
understand
her
expression
said
to
how
could
one
help
not
only
but
even
natasha
understood
the
meaning
of
his
puckered
brow
and
the
happy
complacent
smile
that
slightly
puckered
his
lips
when
anisya
fedorovna
on
the
tray
was
a
bottle
of
herb
different
kinds
of
pickled
rye
cakes
made
with
honey
in
the
still
mead
and
sparkling
nuts
and
and
afterwards
she
brought
a
freshly
roasted
preserves
made
with
and
preserves
made
with
all
this
was
the
fruit
of
anisya
gathered
and
prepared
by
the
smell
and
taste
of
it
all
had
a
smack
of
anisya
fedorovna
a
savor
of
and
pleasant
little
she
kept
as
she
offered
natasha
first
one
thing
and
then
natasha
ate
of
everything
and
thought
she
had
never
seen
or
eaten
such
buttermilk
such
aromatic
such
or
such
a
chicken
anisya
fedorovna
left
the
after
over
their
cherry
rostov
and
talked
of
past
and
future
of
rugay
and
while
natasha
sat
upright
on
the
sofa
and
listened
with
sparkling
she
tried
several
times
to
wake
petya
that
he
might
eat
but
he
only
muttered
incoherent
words
without
waking
natasha
felt
so
lighthearted
and
happy
in
these
novel
surroundings
that
she
only
feared
the
trap
would
come
for
her
too
after
a
casual
such
as
often
occurs
when
receiving
friends
for
the
first
time
in
own
answering
a
thought
that
was
in
his
you
is
how
i
am
finishing
my
death
will
come
nothing
will
then
why
harm
face
was
very
significant
and
even
handsome
as
he
said
involuntarily
rostov
recalled
all
the
good
he
had
heard
about
him
from
his
father
and
the
throughout
the
whole
province
had
the
reputation
of
being
the
most
honorable
and
disinterested
of
they
called
him
in
to
decide

chose
him
as
confided
secrets
to
elected
him
to
be
a
justice
and
to
other
but
he
always
persistently
refused
public
passing
the
autumn
and
spring
in
the
fields
on
his
bay
sitting
at
home
in
and
lying
in
his
overgrown
garden
in

he

you
shut
the
door
at
the
end
of
the
passage
led
to
the
as
they
called
the
room
for
the
hunt
there
was
a
rapid
patter
of
bare
and
an
unseen
hand
opened
the
door
into
the
from
which
came
the
clear
sounds
of
a
balalayka
on
which
who
was
evidently
a
master
of
the
was
natasha
had
been
listening
to
those
strains
for
some
time
and
now
went
out
into
the
passage
to
hear
my
i
have
got
him
a
good
fond
of

it
was
the
custom
for

to
play

balalayka
in

room

returned
from

fond
of
such
really
very
said
nicholas
with
some
unintentional
as
if
ashamed
to
confess
that
the
sounds
pleased
him
very
said
natasha
noticing
her
simply
just
as
pickled
and
cherry
brandy
had
seemed
to
her
the
best
in
the
so
also
that
at
that
seemed
to
her
the
acme
of
musical
cried
natasha
at
the
door
as
soon
as
the
balalayka
mitka
tuned
up
and
recommenced
thrumming
the
balalayka
to
the
air
of
my
with
trills
and
sat
slightly
with
his
head
on
one
the
air
was
repeated
a
hundred
the
balalayka
was
retuned
several
times
and
the
same
notes
were
thrummed
but
the
listeners
did
not
grow
weary
of
it
and
wished
to
hear
it
again
and
anisya
fedorovna
came
in
and
leaned
her
portly
person
against
the
like
she
said
to
with
a
smile
extremely
like
a
good
player

that
part

with
an
energetic
he

but
go
and
see
if
the
strings
of
my
guitar
are
all

touched
it
for
a
long
given

the
case
with
his
bony
tuned

and
settled
himself
in
his
he
took
the
guitar
a
little
above
the
arching
his
left
elbow
with
a
somewhat
theatrical
with
a
wink
at
anisya
struck
a
single
pure
and
and
then
and
confidently
began
playing
in
very
slow
not
my
but
the
came
a
maiden
down
the
the
played
with
precision
and
in
exact
began
to
thrill
in
the
hearts
of
nicholas
and
arousing
in
them
the
same
kind
of
sober
mirth
as
radiated
from
anisya
whole
anisya
fedorovna
and
drawing
her
kerchief
over
her
face
went
laughing
out
of
the
continued
to
play
with
energetic
looking
with
a
changed
and
inspired
expression
at
the
spot
where
anisya
fedorovna
had
just
something
seemed
to
be
laughing
a
little
on
one
side
of
his
face
under
his
gray
especially
as
the
song
grew
brisker
and
the
time
quicker
and
here
and
as
he
ran
his
fingers
over
the
something
seemed
to
go
go
shouted
natasha
as
soon
as
he
had
she
jumped
up
and
hugged
and
kissed
she
turning
to
her
as
if
asking
is
it
moves
me
nicholas
too
was
greatly
pleased
by

played

piece
over

in
the
doorway
and

and
jerked

in
an
imploring
tone
as
if
her
life
depended
on
and
it
was
as
if
there
were
two
men
in
one
of
them
smiled
seriously
at
the
merry
while
the
merry
fellow
struck
a
naive
and
precise
attitude
preparatory
to
a
folk

waving
to
natasha
the
hand
that
had
just
struck
a
natasha
threw
off
the
shawl
from
her
ran
forward
to
face
and
setting
her
arms
akimbo
also
made
a
motion
with
her
shoulders
and
struck
an
and
when
had
this
young
educated
by
an
emigree
french
imbibed
from
the
russian
air
she
breathed
that
spirit
and
obtained
that
manner
which
the
pas
de
chale
one
would
have
long
ago
have
but
the
spirit
and
the
movements
were
those
inimitable
and
unteachable
russian
ones
that
had
expected
of
as
soon
as
she
had
struck
her
and
smiled
and
with
sly
the
fear
that
had
at
first
seized
nicholas
and
the
others
that
she
might
not
do
the
right
thing
was
at
an
and
they
were
already
admiring
the
french
shawl
she
did
the
right
thing
with
such
such
complete
that
anisya
who
had
at
once
handed
her
the
handkerchief
she
needed
for
the
had
tears
in
her
though
she
laughed
as
she
watched
this
graceful
reared
in
silks
and
velvets
and
so
different
from
who
yet
was
able
to
understand
all
that
was
in
anisya
and
in
father
and
mother
and
and
in
every
russian
man
and
little
cried
with
a
joyous
having
finished
the
now
a
fine
young
fellow
must
be
found
as
husband
for
chosen
said
nicholas
said
in
looking
inquiringly
at
who
nodded
her
head
with
a
happy
such
a
she
but
as
soon
as
she
had
said
it
a
new
train
of
thoughts
and
feelings
arose
in
did
smile
mean
when
he
said
is
he
glad
of
it
or
it
is
as
if
he
thought
my
bolkonski
would
not
approve
of
or
understand
our
but
he
would
understand
it
where
is
he
she
and
her
face
suddenly
became
but
this
lasted
only
a
dare
to
think
about
she
said
to
and
sat
down
again
smilingly
beside
begging
him
to
play
something
played
another
song
and
a
then
after
a
pause
he
cleared
his
throat
and
sang
his
favorite
hunting
as
growing
dark
last
night
fell
the
snow
so
soft
and
sang
as
peasants
with
full
and
naive
conviction
that
the
whole
meaning
of
a
song
lies
in
the
words
and
that
the
tune
comes
of
and
that
apart
from
the
words
there
is
no
which
exists
only
to
give
measure
to
the
as
a
result
of
this
the
unconsidered
like
the
song
of
a
was
extraordinarily
natasha
was
in
ecstasies
over
she
resolved
to
give
up
learning
the
harp
and
to
play
only
the
she
asked
for
his
guitar
and
at
once
found
the
chords
of
the
after
nine
two
traps
and
three
mounted
who
had
been
sent
to
look
for
arrived
to
fetch
natasha
and
the
count
and
countess
did
not
know
where
they
were
and
were
very
said
one
of
the
petya
was
carried
out
like
a
log
and
laid
in
the
larger
of
the
two
natasha
and
nicholas
got
into
the
wrapped
natasha
up
warmly
and
took
leave
of
her
with
quite
a
new
he
accompanied
them
on
foot
as
far
as
the
bridge
that
could
not
be
so
that
they
had
to
go
round
by
the
and
he
sent
huntsmen
to
ride
in
front
with
dear
his
voice
called
out
of
the
the
voice
natasha
had
known
but
the
one
that
had
sung
as
growing
dark
last
in
the
village
through
which
they
passed
there
were
red
lights
and
a
cheerful
smell
of
a
darling
uncle
said
when
they
had
come
out
onto
the
returned
not
quite
all
i
feel
so
answered
almost
perplexed
by
her
they
remained
silent
a
long
the
night
was
dark
and
they
could
not
see
the
but
only
heard
them
splashing
through
the
unseen
what
was
passing
in
that
receptive
childlike
soul
that
so
eagerly
caught
and
assimilated
all
the
diverse
impressions
of
how
did
they
all
find
place
in
but
she
was
very
as
they
were
nearing
home
she
suddenly
struck
up
the
air
of
as
growing
dark
last
tune
of
which
she
had
all
the
way
been
trying
to
get
and
had
at
last
said
were
you
thinking
about
just
inquired
they
were
fond
of
asking
one
another
that
said
trying
to
you
first
i
thought
that
the
red
was
like
and
that
if
he
were
a
man
he
would
always
keep
uncle
near
if
not
for
his
then
for
his
what
a
good
fellow
uncle
you
think
and
wait
a
first
i
thought
that
we
are
driving
along
and
imagining
that
we
are
going
but
that
heaven
knows
where
we
are
really
going
in
the
and
that
we
shall
arrive
and
suddenly
find
that
we
are
not
in
but
in
and
then
i
nothing
i
expect
you
thought
of
said
smiling
as
natasha
knew
by
the
sound
of
his
said
though
she
had
in
reality
been
thinking
about
prince
andrew
at
the
same
time
as
of
the
and
of
how
he
would
have
liked
then
i
was
saying
to
myself
all
the
well
anisya
carried
how
and
nicholas
heard
her
ringing
do
you
she
suddenly
know
that
i
shall
never
again
be
as
happy
and
tranquil
as
i
am
exclaimed
and
he
charming
this
natasha
of
mine
i
have
no
other
friend
like
her
and
never
shall
why
should
she
we
might
always
drive
about
a
darling
this
nicholas
of
mine
thought
there
are
still
lights
in
the
she
pointing
to
the
windows
of
the
house
that
gleamed
invitingly
in
the
moist
velvety
darkness
of
the
chapter
viii
count
ilya
rostov
had
resigned
the
position
of
marshal
of
the
nobility
because
it
involved
him
in
too
much
but
still
his
affairs
did
not
natasha
and
nicholas
often
noticed
their
parents
conferring
together
anxiously
and
privately
and
heard
suggestions
of
selling
the
fine
ancestral
rostov
house
and
estate
near
it
was
not
necessary
to
entertain
so
freely
as
when
the
count
had
been
and
life
at
otradnoe
was
quieter
than
in
former
but
still
the
enormous
house
and
its
lodges
were
full
of
people
and
more
than
twenty
sat
down
to
table
every
these
were
all
their
own
people
who
had
settled
down
in
the
house
almost
as
members
of
the
or
persons
who
it
obliged
to
live
in
the
such
were
dimmler
the
musician
and
his
vogel
the
dancing
master
and
his
an
old
maiden
an
inmate
of
the
and
many
others
such
as
the
former
and
other
people
who
simply
found
it
preferable
and
more
advantageous
to
live
in
the
house
than
at
they
had
not
as
many
visitors
as
but
the
old
habits
of
life
without
which
the
count
and
countess
could
not
conceive
of
existence
remained
there
was
still
the
hunting
establishment
which
nicholas
had
even
the
same
fifty
horses
and
fifteen
grooms
in
the
the
same
expensive
presents
and
dinner
parties
to
the
whole
district
on
name
there
were
still
the
games
of
whist
and
at
out
his
cards
so
that
everybody
could
see
let
himself
be
plundered
of
hundreds
of
rubles
every
day
by
his
who
looked
upon
an
opportunity
to
play
a
rubber
with
count
rostov
as
a
most
profitable
source
of
the
count
moved
in
his
affairs
as
in
a
huge
trying
not
to
believe
that
he
was
entangled
but
becoming
more
and
more
so
at
every
and
feeling
too
feeble
to
break
the
meshes
or
to
set
to
work
carefully
and
patiently
to
disentangle
the
with
her
loving
felt
that
her
children
were
being
that
it
was
not
the
fault
for
he
could
not
help
being
what
he
he
tried
to
hide
he
himself
suffered
from
the
consciousness
of
his
own
and
his
and
she
tried
to
find
means
of
remedying
the
from
her
feminine
point
of
view
she
could
see
only
one
for
nicholas
to
marry
a
rich
she
felt
this
to
be
their
last
hope
and
that
if
nicholas
refused
the
match
she
had
found
for
she
would
have
to
abandon
the
hope
of
ever
getting
matters
this
match
was
with
julie
the
daughter
of
excellent
and
virtuous
a
girl
the
rostovs
had
known
from
and
who
had
now
become
a
wealthy
heiress
through
the
death
of
the
last
of
her
the
countess
had
written
direct
to
mother
in
moscow
suggesting
a
marriage
between
their
children
and
had
received
a
favorable
answer
from
karagina
had
replied
that
for
her
part
she
was
and
everything
depend
on
her
she
invited
nicholas
to
come
to
several
times
the
with
tears
in
her
told
her
son
that
now
both
her
daughters
were
her
only
wish
was
to
see
him
she
said
she
could
lie
down
in
her
grave
peacefully
if
that
were
then
she
told
him
that
she
knew
of
a
splendid
girl
and
tried
to
discover
what
he
thought
about
at
other
times
she
praised
julie
to
him
and
advised
him
to
go
to
moscow
during
the
holidays
to
amuse
nicholas
guessed
what
his
remarks
were
leading
to
and
during
one
of
these
conversations
induced
her
to
speak
quite
she
told
him
that
her
only
hope
of
getting
their
affairs
disentangled
now
lay
in
his
marrying
julie
suppose
i
loved
a
girl
who
has
no
would
you
expect
me
to
sacrifice
my
feelings
and
my
honor
for
the
sake
of
he
asked
his
not
realizing
the
cruelty
of
his
question
and
only
wishing
to
show
his
you
have
not
understood
said
his
not
knowing
how
to
justify
have
not
understood
it
is
your
happiness
i
wish
she
feeling
that
she
was
telling
an
untruth
and
was
becoming
she
began
to
only
tell
me
that
you
wish
and
you
know
i
will
give
my
to
put
you
at
said
would
sacrifice
anything
for
my
but
the
countess
did
not
want
the
question
put
like
she
did
not
want
a
sacrifice
from
her
she
herself
wished
to
make
a
sacrifice
for
you
have
not
understood
let
us
talk
about
she
wiping
away
her
i
do
love
a
poor
said
nicholas
to
i
to
sacrifice
my
feelings
and
my
honor
for
i
wonder
how
mamma
could
speak
so
to
because
sonya
is
poor
i
must
not
love
he
not
respond
to
her
devoted
yet
i
should
certainly
be
happier
with
her
than
with
some
i
can
always
sacrifice
my
feelings
for
my
he
said
to
i
coerce
my
if
i
love
that
feeling
is
for
me
stronger
and
higher
than
all
nicholas
did
not
go
to
and
the
countess
did
not
renew
the
conversation
with
him
about
she
saw
with
and
sometimes
with
symptoms
of
a
growing
attachment
between
her
son
and
the
portionless
though
she
blamed
herself
for
she
could
not
refrain
from
grumbling
at
and
worrying
often
pulling
her
up
without
addressing
her
stiffly
as
and
using
the
formal
instead
of
the
intimate
in
speaking
to
the
kindhearted
countess
was
the
more
vexed
with
sonya
because
that
niece
of
hers
was
so
so
so
devotedly
grateful
to
her
and
so
and
unselfishly
in
love
with
that
there
were
no
grounds
for
finding
fault
with
nicholas
was
spending
the
last
of
his
leave
at
a
fourth
letter
had
come
from
prince
from
in
which
he
wrote
that
he
would
have
been
on
his
way
back
to
russia
long
ago
had
not
his
wound
unexpectedly
reopened
in
the
warm
which
obliged
him
to
defer
his
return
till
the
beginning
of
the
new
natasha
was
still
as
much
in
love
with
her
found
the
same
comfort
in
that
and
was
still
as
ready
to
throw
herself
into
all
the
pleasures
of
life
as
but
at
the
end
of
the
fourth
month
of
their
separation
she
began
to
have
fits
of
depression
which
she
could
not
she
felt
sorry
for
sorry
that
she
was
being
wasted
all
this
time
and
of
no
use
to
while
she
felt
herself
so
capable
of
loving
and
being
things
were
not
cheerful
in
the
chapter
ix

for
the
ceremonial
the
solemn
and
wearisome

special
though
the
calm
frost
of
twenty
degrees

dazzling
sunshine

to
call
for

a
dark
corner
behind
a
and
began
to
run
her
fingers
over
the
strings
in
the
picking
out
a
passage
she
recalled
from
an
opera
she
had
heard
in
petersburg
with
prince
what
she
drew
from
the
guitar
would
have
had
no
meaning
for
other
but
in
her
imagination
a
whole
series
of
reminiscences
arose
from
those
she
sat
behind
the
bookcase
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
a
streak
of
light
escaping
from
the
pantry
door
and
listened
to
herself
and
she
was
in
a
mood
for
brooding
on
the
sonya
passed
to
the
pantry
with
a
glass
in
her
natasha
glanced
at
her
and
at
the
crack
in
the
pantry
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
remembered
the
light
falling
through
that
crack
once
before
and
sonya
passing
with
a
glass
in
her
it
was
exactly
the
thought
what
is
she
twanging
a
thick
you
are
said
sonya
with
a
and
came
near
and
a
she
ventured
afraid
of
being
just
how
she
started
and
just
how
she
came
up
smiling
timidly
when
all
this
happened
thought
in
just
the
same
way
i
thought
there
was
something
lacking
in
the
chorus
from
the
and
natasha
sang
the
air
of
the
chorus
so
that
sonya
should
catch
were
you
she
change
the
water
in
this
i
am
just
finishing
the
always
find
something
to
but
i
said
i
go
and
wake
said
him
i
want
him
to
come
and
she
sat
wondering
what
the
meaning
of
it
all
having
happened
before
could
and
without
solving
this
or
at
all
regretting
not
having
done
she
again
passed
in
fancy
to
the
time
when
she
was
with
him
and
he
was
looking
at
her
with
a
if
only
he
would
come
i
am
so
afraid
it
will
never
worst
of
i
am
growing
the
there
then
be
in
me
what
there
is
but
perhaps
come
will
come
perhaps
he
has
come
and
is
sitting
in
the
drawing
perhaps
he
came
yesterday
and
i
have
forgotten
she
put
down
the
and
went
to
the
drawing
all
the
domestic
and
were
already
at
the
tea
the
servants
stood
round
the
prince
andrew
was
not
there
and
life
was
going
on
as
here
she
said
the
old
when
he
saw
natasha
sit
down
by
but
natasha
stayed
by
her
mother
and
glanced
round
as
if
looking
for
she
him
to
give
and
she
again
had
difficulty
in
repressing
her
she
sat
down
at
the
table
and
listened
to
the
conversation
between
the
elders
and
who
had
also
come
to
the
my
the
same
the
same
papa
holding
his
cup
and
blowing
in
the
same
thought
feeling
with
horror
a
sense
of
repulsion
rising
up
in
her
for
the
whole
because
they
were
always
the
after
and
natasha
went
to
the
sitting
to
their
favorite
corner
where
their
most
intimate
talks
always
chapter
x
it
ever
happen
to
said
natasha
to
her
when
they
settled
down
in
the
sitting
it
ever
happen
to
you
to
feel
as
if
there
were
nothing
more
to
that
everything
good
is
and
to
feel
not
exactly
but
should
think
he
have
felt
like
that
when
everything
was
all
right
and
everyone
was
the
thought
has
come
into
my
mind
that
i
was
already
tired
of
it
and
that
we
must
all
once
in
the
regiment
i
had
not
gone
to
some
merrymaking
where
there
was
and
suddenly
i
felt
so
i
i
i
natasha
interrupted
i
was
quite
little
that
used
to
be
so
with
do
you
remember
when
i
was
punished
once
about
some
you
were
all
and
i
sat
sobbing
in
the
i
shall
never
forget
i
felt
sad
and
sorry
for
for
and
for
and
i
was
was
the
chief
said
you
answered
remember
that
i
came
to
you
afterwards
and
wanted
to
comfort
but
do
you
i
felt
ashamed
we
were
terribly
i
had
a
funny
doll
then
and
wanted
to
give
it
to
do
you
do
you
natasha
asked
with
a
pensive
long
when
we
were
quite
uncle
called
us
into
the
was
in
the
old
it
was
went
in
and
suddenly
there
chimed
in
nicholas
with
a
smile
of
course
i
even
now
i
know
whether
there
really
was
a
or
if
we
only
dreamed
it
or
were
told
about
was
you
and
had
white
and
stood
and
looked
at
do
you
asked
i
do
remember
something
sonya
answered
know
i
have
asked
papa
and
mamma
about
that
said
they
say
there
was
no
negro
at
but
you
you
course
i
i
remember
his
teeth
as
if
i
had
just
seen
strange
it
as
if
it
were
a
i
like
do
you
remember
how
we
rolled
eggs
in
the
and
suddenly
two
old
women
began
spinning
round
on
the
was
that
real
or
do
you
remember
what
fun
it
and
you
remember
how
papa
in
his
blue
overcoat
fired
a
gun
in
the
so
they
went
through
their
smiling
with
not
the
sad
memories
of
old
but
youthful
impressions
of
most
distant
past
in
which
dreams
and
realities
they
laughed
with
quiet
as
did
not
quite
keep
pace
with
though
they
shared
the
same
much
that
they
remembered
had
slipped
from
her
and
what
she
recalled
did
not
arouse
the
same
poetic
feeling
as
they
she
simply
enjoyed
their
pleasure
and
tried
to
fit
in
with
she
only
really
took
part
when
they
recalled
first
she
told
them
how
afraid
she
had
been
of
nicholas
because
he
had
on
a
corded
jacket
and
her
nurse
had
told
her
that
would
be
sewn
up
with
i
remember
their
telling
me
that
you
had
been
born
under
a
said
i
remember
that
i
dared
not
disbelieve
it
but
knew
that
it
was
not
and
i
felt
so
while
they
were
talking
a
maid
thrust
her
head
in
at
the
other
door
of
the
sitting
have
brought
the
she
said
in
a
tell
them
to
take
it
replied
in
the
middle
of
their
talk
in
the
sitting
dimmler
came
in
and
went
up
to
the
harp
that
stood
there
in
a
he
took
off
its
cloth
and
the
harp
gave
out
a
jarring
please
play
my
favorite
nocturne
by
came
the
old
voice
from
the
drawing
dimmler
struck
a
chord
turning
to
and
quiet
you
young
people
said
glancing
round
for
a
moment
and
then
continuing
the
they
were
now
discussing
dimmler
began
to
natasha
went
on
tiptoe
noiselessly
to
the
took
up
a
carried
it
and
seating
herself
quietly
in
her
former
it
was
dark
in
the
room
especially
where
they
were
sitting
on
the
but
through
the
big
windows
the
silvery
light
of
the
full
moon
fell
on
the
dimmler
had
finished
the
piece
but
still
sat
softly
running
his
fingers
over
the
evidently
uncertain
whether
to
stop
or
to
play
something
you
said
natasha
in
a
moving
closer
to
nicholas
and
when
one
goes
on
and
on
recalling
one
at
last
begins
to
remember
what
happened
before
one
was
in
the
is
said
who
had
always
learned
and
remembered
egyptians
believed
that
our
souls
have
lived
in
and
will
go
back
into
animals
i
believe
we
ever
were
in
said
still
in
a
whisper
though
the
music
had
i
am
certain
that
we
were
angels
somewhere
and
have
been
and
that
is
why
we
i
join
said
dimmler
who
had
come
up
and
he
sat
down
by
we
have
been
why
have
we
fallen
said
that
who
said
we
were
how
do
i
know
what
i
was
natasha
rejoined
with
soul
is
if
i
shall
always
live
i
must
have
lived
lived
for
a
whole
but
it
is
hard
for
us
to
imagine
remarked
who
had
joined
the
young
folk
with
a
mildly
condescending
smile
but
now
spoke
as
quietly
and
seriously
as
is
it
hard
to
imagine
said
is
now
and
it
will
be
and
and
there
was
and
the
day
now
your
sing
me
they
heard
the
countess
are
you
sitting
there
like
i
at
all
want
replied
but
all
the
same
she
none
of
not
even
the
wanted
to
break
off
their
conversation
and
quit
that
corner
in
the
sitting
but
natasha
got
up
and
nicholas
sat
down
at
the
standing
as
usual
in
the
middle
of
the
hall
and
choosing
the
place
where
the
resonance
was
natasha
began
to
sing
her
favorite
she
had
said
she
did
not
want
to
but
it
was
long
since
she
had
and
long
before
she
again
as
she
did
that
the
from
his
study
where
he
was
talking
to
heard
her
like
a
schoolboy
in
a
hurry
to
run
out
to
blundered
in
his
talk
while
giving
orders
to
the
and
at
last
while
mitenka
stood
in
front
of
him
also
listening
and
nicholas
did
not
take
his
eyes
off
his
sister
and
drew
breath
in
time
with
as
she
thought
of
the
immense
difference
there
was
between
herself
and
her
and
how
impossible
it
was
for
her
to
be
anything
like
as
bewitching
as
her
the
old
countess
sat
with
a
blissful
yet
sad
smile
and
with
tears
in
her
occasionally
shaking
her
she
thought
of
natasha
and
of
her
own
and
of
how
there
was
something
unnatural
and
dreadful
in
this
impending
marriage
of
natasha
and
prince
who
had
seated
himself
beside
the
listened
with
closed
he
said
at
a
european
she
has
nothing
to
and
how
afraid
i
am
for
how
afraid
i
said
the
not
realizing
to
whom
she
was
her
maternal
instinct
told
her
that
natasha
had
too
much
of
and
that
because
of
this
she
would
not
be
before
natasha
had
finished
petya
rushed
in
to
say
that
some
mummers
had
natasha
stopped
she
screamed
at
her
brother
running
to
a
threw
herself
on
sobbing
so
violently
that
she
could
not
stop
for
a
long
really
only
petya
startled
she
trying
to
but
her
tears
still
flowed
and
sobs
still
choked
the
mummers
of
the
house
dressed
up
as
and
and
in
with
them
the
cold
from
outside
and
a
feeling
of
at
first
into
the
then
hiding
behind
one
another
they
pushed
into
the
ballroom
shyly
at
first
and
then
more
and
more
merrily
and
they
started
and
playing
christmas
the
when
she
had
identified
them
and
laughed
at
their
went
into
the
drawing
the
count
sat
in
the
smiling
radiantly
and
applauding
the
the
young
people
had
half
an
hour
later
there
appeared
among
the
other
mummers
in
the
ballroom
an
old
lady
in
a
hooped
was
a
turkish
girl
was
a
clown
was
an
hussar

and
a
circassian
was
sonya
with
mustache
and
after
the
condescending
and
from
those
who
were
not
themselves
dressed
the
young
people
decided
that
their
costumes
were
so
good
that
they
ought
to
be
shown
as
the
roads
were
in
splendid
wanted
to
take
them
all

a
drive

the

not
agree
to
his
he
had
had
a
bad
leg
all
these
last
it
was
decided
that
the
count

that
if
louisa
ivanovna
would
go
with
the
young
ladies

go
to
the

more
urgently

the
best

eyebrows
were
extraordinarily
everyone
told
her

looked
very

she
was
in
a
spirited
and
energetic
mood
unusual
with
some
inner
voice
told
her
that
now
or
never
her
fate
would
be
and
in
her
male
attire
she
seemed
quite
a
different
louisa
ivanovna
consented
to
and
in
half
an
hour
four

large
and
small

and

from

stronger
and
reached
its
climax
when
they
all
came
out
into
the
frost
and
got
into
the
calling

two
of

so
light
that
he
could
see
the
moonlight

from
the
metal
harness

and
from
the
eyes
of
the
who
looked
round

two
maids

their
runners
at

they
drove
at
a
steady
trot
along
the
narrow
while
they
drove
past
the
garden
the
shadows
of
the
bare
trees
often
fell
across
the
road
and
hid
the
brilliant
but
as
soon
as
they
were
past
the
the
snowy
plain
bathed
in
moonlight
and
motionless
spread
out
before

dappled
with

glanced
round
at

bent
down
to
see
her
face
quite
a
sweet
face
with
black
eyebrows
and
mustaches
peeped
up
at
him
from
her
sable
close
and
yet
so
the
used
to
be
thought
and
looked
at
her
closer
and
is
said
he
and
turned
again
to
the
when
they
came
out
onto
the
beaten
by
sleigh
runners
and
cut
up
by
the
marks
of
which
were
visible
in
the
horses
began
to
tug
at
the
reins
of
their
own
accord
and
increased
their
the
near

arching
his
head
and
breaking
into
a
short
tugged
at
his
the

swayed
from

to
moving
his
ears
as
if
it
time
to
begin
in

ahead
the
deep
bell
of
the
sleigh
ringing
farther
and
farther
the
black
horses
driven
by

be
clearly
seen
against

could
hear
the

voices
of

flourishing

met
them
and
the
jerks
given
by
the

who
pulled

their
one
noticed
how
fast
the
troyka
was
nicholas
looked
with
screams
and
waving
of
whips
that
caused
even
the
shaft
horses
to
other
sleighs
the
shaft
horse
swung
steadily
beneath
the
bow
over
its
with
no
thought
of
slackening
pace
and
ready
to
put
on
speed
when
nicholas
overtook
the
first

were
driving
downhill
and
coming
out
upon
a

to

while
still
keeping

one
hand
with
the
you
he
nicholas
put
all
his
horses
to
a
gallop
and
passed
the
horses
showered
the
fine
dry
snow
on
the
faces
of
those
in
the
them
sounded
quick
ringing
bells
and
they
caught
confused
glimpses
of
swiftly
moving
legs
and
the
shadows
of
the
troyka
they
were
the
whistling
sound
of
the
runners
on
the
snow
and
the
voices
of
girls
shrieking
were
heard
from
different
again
checking
his
nicholas
looked
around
they
were
still
surrounded
by
the
magic
plain
bathed
in
moonlight
and
spangled
with
is
shouting
that
i
should
turn
to
the
but
why
to
the
thought
we
getting
to
the
is
this
heaven
only
knows
where
we
are
and
heaven
knows
what
is
happening
to
it
is
very
strange
and
pleasant
whatever
it
and
he
looked
round
in
the
his
mustache
and
eyelashes
are
all
said
one
of
the
unfamiliar
one
with
fine
eyebrows
and
think
this
used
to
be
thought
that
was
madame
but
perhaps
and
this
circassian
with
the
mustache
i
but
i
love
you
he
they
did
not
answer
but
began
to
dimmler
from
the
sleigh
behind
shouted
something
they
could
not
make
out
what
he
some
voices
here
was
a
fairy
forest
with
black
moving
and
a
glitter
of
diamonds
and
a
flight
of
marble
steps
and
the
silver
roofs
of
fairy
buildings
and
the
shrill
yells
of
some
and
if
this
is
really
it
is
still
stranger
that
we
drove
heaven
knows
where
and
have
come
to
thought
it
really
was
and
maids
and
footmen
with
merry
faces

into

looking
at

throw
on
the

into

a
laid

table
for
all
and
sat
after
sitting
a
she
suddenly
hears
someone
a
sleigh
drives
up
with
harness
she
hears
him
he
comes
just
in
the
shape
of
a
like
an
in
and
sits
down
to
table
with
screamed
rolling
her
eyes
with
and
did
he
like
a
everything
quite
all
and
he
began
persuading
and
she
should
have
kept
him
talking
till
but
she
got
just
got
frightened
and
hid
her
face
in
her
then
he
caught
her
it
was
lucky
the
maids
ran
in
just
why

said
pelageya
you
used
to
try
your
fate
said
her
how
does
one
do
it
in
a
inquired
say
you
went
to
the
barn
and
it
depends
on
what
you
hammering
and
but
a
sound
of
shifting
grain
is
good
and
one
sometimes
hears
tell
us
what
happened
to
you
in
the
pelageya
danilovna
she
none
of
you
would
i
pelageya
let
said
why
if
not
may
asked
whether
they
were
playing
the
ring
and
string
game
or
the
ruble
game
or
talking
as
nicholas
did
not
leave
and
gazed
at
her
with
quite
new
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
was
only
thanks
to
that
that
he
had
fully
learned
to
know
and
that
sonya
was
more
and
prettier
than
nicholas
had
ever
seen
her
what
she
is
what
a
fool
i
have
he
thought
gazing
at
her
sparkling
and
under
the
mustache
a
happy
rapturous
smile
dimpled
her
a
smile
he
had
never
seen
not
afraid
of
said
i
go
at
she
got
they
told
her
where
the
barn
was
and
how
she
should
stand
and
and
they
handed
her
a
fur
she
threw
this
over
her
head
and
shoulders
and
glanced
at
a
darling
that
girl
thought
what
have
i
been
thinking
of
till
sonya
went
out
into
the
passage
to
go
to
the
nicholas
went
hastily
to
the
front
saying
he
felt
too
the
crowd
of
people
really
had
made
the
house
there
was
the
same
cold
stillness
and
the
same
but
even
brighter
than
the
light
was
so
strong
and
the
snow
sparkled
with
so
many
stars
that
one
did
not
wish
to
look
up
at
the
sky
and
the
real
stars
were
the
sky
was
black
and
while
the
earth
was
am
a
a
what
have
i
been
waiting
thought
and
running
out
from
the
porch
he
went
round
the
corner
of
the
house
and
along
the
path
that
led
to
the
back
he
knew
sonya
would
pass
that
halfway
lay
some
piles
of
firewood
and
across
and
along
them
a
network
of
shadows
from
the
bare
old
lime
trees
fell
on
the
snow
and
on
the
this
path
led
to
the
the
log
walls
of
the
barn
and
its
that
looked
as
if
hewn
out
of
some
precious
sparkled
in
the
a
tree
in
the
garden
snapped
with
the
and
then
all
was
again
perfectly
his
bosom
seemed
to
inhale
not
air
but
the
strength
of
eternal
youth
and
from
the
back
porch
came
the
sound
of
feet
descending
the
the
bottom
step
upon
which
snow
had
fallen
gave
a
ringing
creak
and
he
heard
the
voice
of
an
old
maidservant
along
the
look
am
not
answered
and
along
the
path
toward
nicholas
came
the
whistling
sound
of
feet
in
her
thin
sonya
came
wrapped
in
her
she
was
only
a
couple
of
paces
away
when
she
saw
and
to
her
too
he
was
not
the
nicholas
she
had
known
and
always
slightly
he
was
in
a
with
tousled
hair
and
a
happy
smile
new
to
she
ran
rapidly
toward
different
and
yet
the
thought
looking
at
her
face
all
lit
up
by
the
he
slipped
his
arms
under
the
cloak
that
covered
her
embraced
pressed
her
to
and
kissed
her
on
the
lips
that
wore
a
mustache
and
had
a
smell
of
burnt
sonya
kissed
him
full
on
the
and
disengaging
her
little
hands
pressed
them
to
his
was
all
they
they
ran
to
the
barn
and
then
back
he
by
the
front
and
she
by
the
back
chapter
xii
when
they
all
drove
back
from
pelageya
who
always
saw
and
noticed
arranged
that
she
and
madame
schoss
should
go
back
in
the
sleigh
with
and
sonya
with
nicholas
and
the
on
the
way
back
nicholas
drove
at
a
steady
pace
instead
of
racing
and
kept
peering
by
that
fantastic
light
into
face
and
searching
beneath
the
eyebrows
and
mustache
for
his
former
and
his
present
sonya
from
whom
he
had
resolved
never
to
be
parted
he
looked
and
recognizing
in
her
both
the
old
and
the
new
and
being
reminded
by
the
smell
of
burnt
cork
of
the
sensation
of
her
inhaled
the
frosty
air
with
a
full
breast
looking
at
the
ground
flying
beneath
him
and
at
the
sparkling
felt
himself
again
in
is
it
well
with
he
asked
from
time
to
she
with
when
halfway
home
nicholas
handed
the
reins
to
the
coachman
and
ran
for
a
moment
to
sleigh
and
stood
on
its
he
whispered
in
you
know
i
have
made
up
my
mind
about
you
told
asked
suddenly
beaming
all
over
with
how
strange
you
are
with
that
mustache
and
those
you
am
so
so
i
was
beginning
to
be
vexed
with
i
did
not
tell
but
you
have
been
treating
her
what
a
heart
she
i
am
horrid
but
i
was
ashamed
to
be
happy
while
sonya
was
continued
i
am
so
run
back
to
wait
a
how
funny
you
cried
peering
into
her
face
and
finding
in
his
sister
too
something
and
bewitchingly
tender
that
he
had
not
seen
in
her
she
have
done
i
seen
her
before
as
she
is
thought
should
long
ago
have
asked
her
what
to
do
and
have
done
whatever
she
told
and
all
would
have
been
you
are
glad
and
i
have
done
quite
i
had
a
quarrel
with
mamma
some
time
ago
about
mamma
said
she
was
angling
for
how
could
she
say
such
a
i
nearly
stormed
at
i
will
never
let
anyone
say
anything
bad
of
for
there
is
nothing
but
good
in
all
said
again
scrutinizing
the
expression
of
his
face
to
see
if
she
was
in
then
he
jumped
down
his
boots
scrunching
the
ran
back
to
his
the
same
smiling
with
mustache
and
beaming
eyes
looking
up
from
under
a
sable
was
still
sitting
and
that
circassian
was
and
that
sonya
was
certainly
his
future
happy
and
loving
when
they
reached
home
and
had
told
their
mother
how
they
had
spent
the
evening
at
the
the
girls
went
to
their
when
they
had
but
without
washing
off
the
cork
they
sat
a
long
time
talking
of
their
they
talked
of
how
they
would
live
when
they
were
how
their
husbands
would
be
and
how
happy
they
would
on
table
stood
two
looking
glasses
which
dunyasha
had
prepared
when

am
afraid

would
be
too

rising
and
going
to
the
looking

the

on
each
side
of
one
of
the
looking
and
sat

her
own

with
help
and
the
natasha
got
the
glass
she
held
into
the
right
position
opposite
the
her
face
assumed
a
serious
expression
and
she
sat
she
sat
a
long
time
looking
at
the
receding
line
of
candles
reflected
in
the
glasses
and
expecting
tales
she
had
to
see
a
or
prince
in
that
last
indistinctly
outlined
but
ready
as
she
was
to
take
the
smallest
speck
for
the
image
of
a
man
or
of
a
she
saw
she
began
blinking
rapidly
and
moved
away
from

she
saw
something
last
for
about
three
minutes
all
were
course
she
whispered
but
did
not
suddenly
sonya
pushed
away
the
glass
she
was
holding
and
covered
her
eyes
with
her
she
you
did
what
was
exclaimed
holding
up
the
looking
sonya
had
not
seen
she
was
just
wanting
to
blink
and
to
get
up
when
she
heard
natasha
course
she
she
did
not
wish
to
disappoint
either
dunyasha
or
but
it
was
hard
to
sit
she
did
not
herself
know
how
or
why
the
exclamation
escaped
her
when
she
covered
her
saw
urged
seizing
her
wait
a
saw
sonya
could
not
help
not
yet
knowing
whom
natasha
meant
by
nicholas
or
prince
why
i
say
i
saw
others
do
besides
who
can
tell
whether
i
saw
anything
or
flashed
through
i
saw
she
standing
or
i
at
first
there
was
then
i
saw
him
lying
is
he
asked
her
frightened
eyes
fixed
on
her
on
the
on
the
his
face
was
and
he
turned
to
and
when
saying
this
she
herself
fancied
she
had
really
seen
what
she
and
i
could
not
make
out
what
there
something
blue
and
when
will
he
come
when
shall
i
see
how
afraid
i
am
for
him
and
for
myself
and
about
natasha
and
without
replying
to
words
of
comfort
she
got
into
and
long
after
her
candle
was
out
lay
and
gazing
at
the
moonlight
through
the
frosty
chapter
xiii
soon
after
the
christmas
holidays
nicholas
told
his
mother
of
his
love
for
sonya
and
of
his
firm
resolve
to
marry
the
who
had
long
noticed
what
was
going
on
between
them
and
was
expecting
this
listened
to
him
in
silence
and
then
told
her
son
that
he
might
marry
whom
he
but
that
neither
she
nor
his
father
would
give
their
blessing
to
such
a
for
the
first
felt
that
his
mother
was
displeased
with
him
and
despite
her
love
for
she
would
not
give
without
looking
at
her
she
sent
for
her
husband
when
he
tried
briefly
and
coldly
to
inform
him
of
the
in
her
but
unable
to
restrain
herself
she
burst
into
tears
of
vexation
and
left
the
the
old
count
began
irresolutely
to
admonish
nicholas
and
beg
him
to
abandon
his
nicholas
replied
that
he
could
not
go
back
on
his
and
his
sighing
and
evidently
very
soon
became
silent
and
went
in
to
the
in
all
his
encounters
with
his
the
count
was
always
conscious
of
his
own
guilt
toward
him
for
having
wasted
the
family
and
so
he
could
not
be
angry
with
him
for
refusing
to
marry
an
heiress
and
choosing
the
dowerless
on
this
he
was
only
more
vividly
conscious
of
the
fact
that
if
his
affairs
had
not
been
in
no
better
wife
for
nicholas
than
sonya
could
have
been
wished
and
that
no
one
but
himself
with
his
mitenka
and
his
uncomfortable
habits
was
to
blame
for
the
condition
of
the
family
the
father
and
mother
did
not
speak
of
the
matter
to
their
son
but
a
few
days
later
the
countess
sent
for
sonya
with
a
cruelty
neither
of
them
reproached
her
niece
for
trying
to
catch
nicholas
and
for
sonya
listened
silently
with
downcast
eyes
to
the
cruel
without
understanding
what
was
required
of
she
was
ready
to
sacrifice
everything
for
her
sacrifice
was
her
most
cherished
idea
but
in
this
case
she
could
not
see
what
she
ought
to
or
for
she
could

the
expression
of

unhappy
at
the

artificial

she
expressed
by

she
wrote
to

attached
no

was
still
no
improvement

the

a
genial

sums

taken

would
have
given
everything

never

or
soiree
at
the

without
as
soon
as
he
sank
into
his
place
on
the
sofa
after
two
bottles
of
margaux
he
was
and
and
joking
when
there
were
his
kindly
smile
and
jests
reconciled
the
the
masonic
dinners
were
dull
and
dreary
when
he
was
not
when
after
a
bachelor
supper
he
rose
with
his
amiable
and
kindly
yielding
to
the
entreaties
of
the
festive
company
to
drive
off

shouts
of

triumph

danced
if
a

liked

without

equally
amiable

was
one
of
those
retired
of
whom
there
were
hundreds
ending
their
days
in
how
horrified
he
would
have
been
seven
years
when
he
first
arrived
from
had
he
been
told
that
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
seek
or
plan
that
his
rut
had
long
been
eternally
and
that
wriggle
as
he
he
would
be
what
all
in
his
position
he
could
not
have
believed
had
he
not
at
one
time
longed
with
all
his
heart
to
establish
a
republic
in
then
himself
to
be
a

to
be
a
and
then
a
strategist
and
the
conqueror
of

he
not
seen
the
possibility
and
passionately
the
regeneration
of
the
sinful
human
and
his
own
progress
to
the
highest
degree
of
had
he
not
established
schools
and
hospitals
and
liberated
his
but
instead
of
all
he
the
wealthy
husband
of
an
unfaithful
a
retired
fond
of
eating
and
drinking
as
he
unbuttoned
his
of
abusing
the
government
a
a
member
of
the
moscow
english
and
a
universal
favorite
in
moscow
for
a
long
time
he
could
not
reconcile
himself
to
the
idea
that
he
was
one
of
those
same
retired
moscow
he
had
so
despised
seven
years
sometimes
he
consoled
himself
with
the
thought
that
he
was
only
living
this
life
but
then
he
was
shocked
by
the
thought
of
how
like
had
entered
that
life
and
that
club
with
all
their
teeth
and
and
had
only
left
it
when
not
a
single
tooth
or
hair
in
moments
of
when
he
thought
of
his
position
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
quite
different
and
distinct
from
those
other
retired
he
had
formerly
they
were
contented
satisfied
with
their
i
am
still
discontented
and
want
to
do
something
for
but
perhaps
all
these
comrades
of
mine
struggled
just
like
me
and
sought
something
a
path
in
life
of
their
and
like
me
were
brought
by
force
of
and
that
elemental
force
against
which
man
is
the
condition
i
am
said
he
to
himself
in
moments
of
and
after
living
some
time
in
moscow
he
no
longer
but
began
to
grow
fond
to
and
to
pity
his
comrades
in
as
he
pitied
pierre
no
longer
suffered
moments
of
and
disgust
with
but
the
malady
that
had
formerly
found
expression
in
such
acute
attacks
was
driven
inwards
and
never
left
him
for
a
what
is
going
on
in
the
he
would
ask
himself
in
perplexity
several
times
a
involuntarily
beginning
to
reflect
anew
on
the
meaning
of
the
phenomena
of
but
knowing
by
experience
that
there
were
no
answers
to
these
questions
he
made
haste
to
turn
away
from
and
took
up
a
or
hurried
off
to
the
club
or
to
apollon
to
exchange
the
gossip
of
the
who
has
never
cared
for
anything
but
her
own
body
and
is
one
of
the
stupidest
women

by
people
as

acme

to

and
a

a

to
kiss
before
his

thought
and
the
whole
of
this
general
deception
which
everyone
accustomed
as
he
was
to
astonished
him
each
time
as
if
it
were
something
understand
the
deception
and
he
how
am
i
to
tell
them
all
that
i
i
have
and
have
always
found
that
they
too
in
the
depths
of
their
souls
understand
it
as
i
and
only
try
not
to
see
so
it
appears
that
it
must
be
but
is
to
become
of
thought
he
had
the
unfortunate
capacity
many
especially
have
of
seeing
and
believing
in
the
possibility
of
goodness
and
but
of
seeing
the
evil
and
falsehood
of
life
too
clearly
to
be
able
to
take
a
serious
part
in
every
sphere
of
work
was
in
his
with
evil
and
whatever
he
tried
to
whatever
he
engaged
the
evil
and
falsehood
of
it
repulsed
him
and
blocked
every
path
of
yet
he
had
to
live
and
to
find
it
was
too
dreadful
to
be
under
the
burden
of
these
insoluble
so
he
abandoned
himself
to
any
distraction
in
order
to
forget
he
frequented
every
kind
of
drank
bought
engaged
in
and
above
he
and
read
everything
that
came
to
on
coming
while
his
valets
were
still
taking
off
his
he
picked
up
a
book
and
began
to
from
reading
he
passed
to
from
sleeping
to
gossip
in
drawing
rooms
of
the
from
gossip
to
carousals
and
from
carousals
back
to
and
drinking
became
more
and
more
a
physical
and
also
a
moral
though
the
doctors
warned
him
that
with
his
corpulence
wine
was
dangerous
for
he
drank
a
great
he
was
only
quite
at
ease
when
having
poured
several
glasses
of
wine
mechanically
into
his
large
mouth
he
felt
a
pleasant
warmth
in
his
an
amiability
toward
all
his
and
a
readiness
to
respond
superficially
to
every
idea
without
probing
it
only
after
emptying
a
bottle
or
two
did
he
feel
dimly
that
the
terribly
tangled
skein
of
life
which
previously
had
terrified
him
was
not
as
dreadful
as
he
had
he
was
always
conscious
of
some
aspect
of
that
as
with
a
buzzing
in
his
head
after
dinner
or
supper
he
chatted
or
listened
to
conversation
or
but
under
the
influence
of
wine
he
said
to
get
it
i
have
a
solution
but
have
no
time
think
it
all
out
later
but
the
later
on
never
in
the
on
an
empty
all
the
old
questions
appeared
as
insoluble
and
terrible
as
and
pierre
hastily
picked
up
a
and
if
anyone
came
to
see
him
he
was
sometimes
he
remembered
how
he
had
heard
that
soldiers
in
war
when
entrenched
under
the
if
they
have
nothing
to
try
hard
to
find
some
occupation
the
more
easily
to
bear
the

pierre
all
men
seemed
like
those
seeking
refuge
from
some
in
some
in
some
in
framing
some
in
some
in
some
in
some
in
some
in
some
in

some
in

and
nothing
is
all
the
to
save
oneself
from
it
as
best
one
thought
not
to
see
that
dreadful

the
beginning
of
winter
prince
nicholas
bolkonski
and
his
daughter

to
at
that
time
enthusiasm
for

emperor

had
weakened

a
patriotic
and
tendency
prevailed
and
together
with
his
past
and
his
intellect

his
at

nicholas
bolkonski

object
of
particular
respect
to
the
moscovites
and
the
center
of
the
moscow
opposition
to

the
prince
had
aged
very
much
that
he
showed
marked
signs
of
senility
by
a
tendency
to
fall
forgetfulness
of
quite
recent
remembrance
of
remote
and
the
childish
vanity
with
which
he
accepted
the
role
of

of

moscow
in
spite
of
this
the
old
man
inspired
in
all
his
visitors
alike
a
feeling
of
respectful
of
an
evening
when
he
came
in
to
tea
in
his
fashioned
coat
and
powdered
wig
aroused
by
told
his
abrupt
stories
of
the
or
uttered
yet
more
abrupt
and
scathing
criticisms
of
the

them
that
house
with
its
gigantic
powdered

the
stern
shrewd
old
man

relic
of
the
past
with
his
gentle
daughter
and
the
pretty
frenchwoman
who
were
reverently
devoted
to
him
presented
a
majestic
and
agreeable
but
the
visitors
did
not
reflect
that
besides
the
couple
of
hours
during
which
they
saw
their
there
were
also
hours
in
the
day
during
which
the
private
and
intimate
life
of
the
house
latterly
that
private
life
had
become
very
trying
for
princess
there
in
moscow
she
was
deprived
of
her
greatest

the
pilgrims
and
the
solitude
which
refreshed
her
at

she
had
none
of
the
advantages
and
pleasures
of

she
did
not
go
out
into
everyone
knew
that
her
father
would
not
let
her
go
anywhere
without
and
his
failing
health
prevented
his
going
out
so
that
she
was
not
invited
to
dinners
and
evening
she
had
quite
abandoned
the
hope
of
getting

the
coldness
and
malevolence

which
the
old
prince
received
and
dismissed
the
young

sometimes
appeared

had
no

this
visit
to
moscow
she
had
been
disappointed
in
the
two
who
had
been
nearest
to
mademoiselle
with
whom
she
had
never
been
able
to
be
quite
had
now
become
unpleasant
to
and
for
various
reasons
princess
mary
avoided
with
whom
she
had
corresponded
for
the
last
five
was
in
but
proved
to
be
quite
alien
to
her
when
they
just
then
who
by
the
death
of
her
brothers
had
become
one
of
the
richest
heiresses
in
was
in
the
full
whirl
of
society
she
was
surrounded
by
young
men
she
had
suddenly
learned
to
appreciate
her
julie
was
at
that
stage
in
the
life
of
a
society
woman
when
she
feels
that
her
last
chance
of
marrying
has
come
and
that
her
fate
must
be
decided
now
or
on
thursdays
princess
mary
remembered
with
a
mournful
smile
that
she
now
had
no
one
to
write
since
presence
gave
her
no
pleasure
was
here
and
they
met
every
like
the
old
emigre
who
declined
to
marry
the
lady
with
whom
he
had
spent
his
evenings
for
she
regretted
presence
and
having
no
one
to
write
in
moscow
princess
mary
had
no
one
to
talk
no
one
to
whom
to
confide
her
and
much
sorrow
fell
to
her
lot
just
the
time
for
prince
return
and
marriage
was
but
his
request
to
her
to
prepare
his
father
for
it
had
not
been
carried
in
it
seemed
as
if
matters
were
quite
for
at
every
mention
of
the
young
countess
rostova
the
old
prince
apart
from
that
was
usually
in
a
bad
lost
control
of
another
lately
added
sorrow
arose
from
the
lessons
she
gave
her
six
to
her
consternation
she
detected
in
herself
in
relation
to
little
nicholas
some
symptoms
of
her
however
often
she
told
herself
that
she
must
not
get
irritable
when
teaching
her
almost
every
time
pointer
in
she
sat
down
to
show
him
the
french
she
so
longed
to
pour
her
own
knowledge
quickly
and
easily
into
the
was
already
afraid
that
auntie
might
at
any
moment
get
at
his
slightest
inattention
she
became
flustered
and
raised
her
and
sometimes
pulled
him
by
the
arm
and
put
him
in
the
having
put
him
in
the
corner
she
would
herself
begin
to
cry
over
her
evil
and
little
following
her
would
and
without
permission
would
leave
his
come
to
pull
her
wet
hands
from
her
and
comfort
but
what
distressed
the
princess
most
of
all
was
her
which
was
always
directed
against
her
and
had
of
late
amounted
to
had
he
forced
her
to
prostrate
herself
to
the
ground
all
had
he
beaten
her
or
made
her
fetch
wood
or
it
would
never
have
entered
her
mind
to
think
her
position
but
this
loving
more
cruel
because
he
loved
her
and
for
that
reason
tormented
himself
and
how
not
merely
to
hurt
and
humiliate
her
but
to
show
her
that
she
was
always
to
blame
for
of
late
he
had
exhibited
a
new
trait
that
tormented
princess
mary
more
than
anything
this
was
his
intimacy
with
mademoiselle
the
idea
that
at
the
first
moment
of
receiving
the
news
of
his
intentions
had
occurred
to
him
in
if
andrew
got
married
he
himself
would
marry
evidently
pleased
and
latterly
he
had
and
as
it
seemed
to
princess
mary
merely
to
offend
shown
special
endearments
to
the
companion
and
expressed
his
dissatisfaction
with
his
daughter
by
demonstrations
of
love
of
one
day
in
moscow
in
princess
presence
thought
her
father
did
it
purposely
when
she
was
the
old
prince
kissed
mademoiselle
hand
drawing
her
to
embraced
her
princess
mary
flushed
and
ran
out
of
the
a
few
minutes
later
mademoiselle
bourienne
came
into
princess
room
smiling
and
making
cheerful
remarks
in
her
agreeable
princess
mary
hastily
wiped
away
her
went
resolutely
up
to
mademoiselle
and
evidently
unconscious
of
what
she
was
doing
began
shouting
in
angry
haste
at
the
her
voice
to
take
advantage
of
the
she
did
not
my
she
and
burst
into
next
day
the
prince
did
not
say
a
word
to
his
but
she
noticed
that
at
dinner
he
gave
orders
that
mademoiselle
bourienne
should
be
served
after
when
the
footman
handed
coffee
and
from
habit
began
with
the
the
prince
suddenly
grew
threw
his
stick
at
and
instantly
gave
instructions
to
have
him
conscripted
for
the
i
said
it
and
he
she
is
the
first
person
in
this
my
best
cried
the
if
you
allow
he
screamed
in
a
addressing
princess
mary
for
the
first
forget
yourself
again
before
her
as
you
dared
to
do
i
will
show
you
who
is
master
in
this
let
me
set
eyes
on
beg
her
princess
mary
asked
mademoiselle
and
also
her
pardon
for
herself
and
for
philip
the
who
had
begged
for
her
at
such
moments
something
like
a
pride
of
sacrifice
gathered
in
her
and
suddenly
that
father
whom
she
had
judged
would
look
for
his
spectacles
in
her
fumbling
near
them
and
not
seeing
or
would
forget
something
that
had
just
or
take
a
false
step
with
his
failing
legs
and
turn
to
see
if
anyone
had
noticed
his
worst
of
at
dinner
when
there
were
no
visitors
to
excite
him
would
suddenly
fall
letting
his
napkin
drop
and
his
shaking
head
sink
over
his
is
old
and
and
i
dare
to
condemn
she
thought
at
such
with
a
feeling
of
revulsion
against
chapter
iii
in
1811
there
was
living
in
moscow
a
french

rapidly
become
the

was
enormously
amiable
as
frenchmen
and
as
all
moscow
an
extraordinarily
clever
he
was
received
in
the
best
houses
not
merely
as
a
but
as
an
prince
nicholas
had
always
ridiculed
but
latterly
on
mademoiselle
advice
had
allowed
this
doctor
to
visit
him
and
had
grown
accustomed
to
metivier
came
to
see
the
prince
about
twice
a
on
december
day
and
the
name
moscow
came
to
the
front
door
but
he
gave
orders
to
admit
no
one
and
to
invite
to
dinner
only
a
small
a
list
of
whom
he
gave
to
princess
who
came
in
the
morning
with
his
considered
it
proper
in
his
quality
of
doctor
de
forcer
la
as
he
told
princess
and
went
in
to
see
the
it
happened
that
on
that
morning
of
his
name
day
the
prince
was
in
one
of
his
worst
he
had
been
going
about
the
house
all
the
morning
finding
fault
with
everyone
and
pretending
not
to
understand
what
was
said
to
him
and
not
to
be
understood
princess
mary
well
knew
this
mood
of
quiet
absorbed
which
generally
culminated
in
a
burst
of
and
she
went
about
all
that
morning
as
though
facing
a
cocked
and
loaded
gun
and
awaited
the
inevitable
until
the
arrival
the
morning
had
passed
off
after
admitting
the
princess
mary
sat
down
with
a
book
in
the
drawing
room
near
the
door
through
which
she
could
hear
all
that
passed
in
the
to
force
the
at
first
she
heard
only
then
her
then
both
voices
began
speaking
at
the
same
the
door
was
flung
and
on
the
threshold
appeared
the
handsome
figure
of
the
terrified
metivier
with
his
shock
of
black
and
the
prince
in
his
dressing
gown
and
his
face
distorted
with
fury
and
the
pupils
of
his
eyes
rolled
shouted
the

french
slave

out
of
my

tell
shrugging
his
went
up
to
mademoiselle
bourienne
who
at
the
sound
of
shouting
had
run
in
from
an
adjoining
prince
is
not
very
bile
and
rush
of
blood
to
the
keep
i
will
call
again
said
and
putting
his
fingers
to
his
lips
he
hastened
through
the
study
door
came
the
sound
of
slippered
feet
and
the
traitors
not
a
peace
in
my
own
after
departure
the
old
prince
called
his
daughter
and
the
whole
weight
of
his
wrath
fell
on
she
was
to
blame
that
a
spy
had
been
had
he
not
told
told
her
to
make
a
and
not
to
admit
anyone
who
was
not
on
that
then
why
was
that
scoundrel
she
was
the
cause
of
it
with
he
he
could
not
have
a
peace
and
could
not
die

must
we
must
understand
understand
i
cannot
endure
any

and
left
the
as
if
afraid
she
might
find
some
means
of
he
returned
and
trying
to
appear
calm
imagine
i
have
said
this
in
a
moment
of
i
am
i
have
thought
it
and
it
will
be
carried
must
so
find
some
place
for
but
he
could
not
restrain
himself
and
with
the
virulence
of
which
only
one
who
loves
is
evidently
suffering
he
shook
his
fists
at
her
and
only
some
fool
would
marry
then
he
slammed
the
sent
for
mademoiselle
and
subsided
into
his
at
two
the
six
chosen
guests
assembled
for
these
famous
count
prince
lopukhin
with
his
general
chatrov

and
of
the
younger
generation

and
boris
the
prince
in
the
drawing
who
had
come
to
moscow
on
leave
a
few
days
had
been
anxious
to
be
presented
to
prince
nicholas
and
had
contrived
to
ingratiate
himself
so
well
that
the
old
prince
in
his
case
made
an
exception
to
the
rule
of
not
receiving
bachelors
in
his
the
house
did
not
belong
to
what
is
known
as
fashionable
but
his
little
not
much
talked
about
in
was
one
it
was
more
flattering
to
be
received
in
than
any
boris
had
realized
this
the
week
before
when
the
in
his
presence
invited
rostopchin
to
dinner
on
and
rostopchin
had
replied
that
he
could
not
that
day
i
always
go
to
pay
my
devotions
to
the
relics
of
prince
nicholas
replied
the
is
the
small
group
that
assembled
before
dinner
in
the
lofty
drawing
room
with
its
old
furniture
resembled
the
solemn
gathering
of
a
court
of
all
were
silent
or
talked
in
low
prince
nicholas
came
in
serious
and
princess
mary
seemed
even
quieter
and
more
diffident
than
the
guests
were
reluctant
to
address
feeling
that
she
was
in
no
mood
for
their
count
rostopchin

kept
the
conversation
now
relating
the
latest
town
and
now
the
latest

as
a
presiding
judge

silently
or
by
a
brief
showing
that
he
took
heed
of
what
was
being
reported
to
the
tone
of
the
conversation
was
such
as
indicated
that
no
one
approved
of
what
was
being
done
in
the
political
incidents
were
related
evidently
confirming
the
opinion
that
everything
was
going
from
bad
to
but
whether
telling
a
story
or
giving
an
opinion
the
speaker
always
or
was
at
the
point
beyond
which
his
criticism
might
touch
the
sovereign
at
dinner
the
talk
turned
on
the
latest
political
seizure
of
the
duke
of

the
russian
hostile
to
which
had
been
sent
to
all
the
european

as
a
pirate
does
a
captured

count
repeating
a
phrase
he
had
uttered
several
times
only
wonders
at
the
or
blindness
of
the
crowned
now
the
turn
has
come
and
bonaparte

to
depose
the
head
of
the
catholic
all
keep
our
sovereign
alone
has
protested
against
the
seizure
of
the
duke
of
and
count
rostopchin
feeling
that
he
had
reached
the
limit
beyond
which
censure
was

been
offered
in
exchange
for

his

remarked
joining

said
this
because
on
his
journey
from

he
had
had
the
honor
of
being
presented
to
the
prince
bolkonski
glanced
at
the
young
man
as
if
about
to
say
something
in
but
changed
his
evidently
considering
him
too
have
read
our
protests
about
the
oldenburg
affair
and
was
surprised
how
badly
the
note
was
remarked
count
rostopchin
in
the
casual
tone
of
a
man
dealing
with
a
subject
quite
familiar
to
pierre
looked
at
rostopchin
with
naive
not
understanding
why
he
should
be
disturbed
by
the
bad
composition
of
the
it
how
the
note
is
he
long
as
its
substance
is
dear
with
our
five
hundred
thousand
troops
it
should
be
easy
to
have
a
good
returned
count
pierre
now
understood
the
dissatisfaction
with
the
wording
of
the
would
have
thought
quill
drivers
enough
had
sprung
remarked
the
old
in
petersburg
they
are
always
notes
only
but
even
new
my
andrew
there
has
written
a
whole
volume
of
laws
for
nowadays
they
are
always
and
he
laughed
there
was
a
momentary
pause
in
the
the
old
general
cleared
his
throat
to
draw
you
hear
of
the
last
event
at
the
review
in
the
figure
cut
by
the
new
french
i
heard
he
said
something
awkward
in
his
majesty
drew
attention
to
the
grenadier
division
and
to
the
march
continued
the
it
seems
the
ambassador
took
no
notice
and
allowed
himself
to
reply
in
france
pay
no
attention
to
such
the
emperor
did
not
condescend
to
at
the
next
they
the
emperor
did
not
once
deign
to
address
all
were
on
this
fact
relating
to
the
emperor
it
was
impossible
to
pass
any
said
the
know
i
turned
him
out
of
my
house
this
he
was
they
admitted
him
in
spite
of
my
request
that
they
should
let
no
one
he
went
glancing
angrily
at
his
and
he
narrated
his
whole
conversation
with
the
french
doctor
and
the
reasons
that
convinced
him
that
metivier
was
a
though
these
reasons
were
very
insufficient
and
no
one
made
any
after
the
champagne
was
the
guests
rose
to
congratulate
the
old
princess
went
round
to
he
gave
her
a
angry
look
and
offered
her
his
shaven
cheek
to
the
whole
expression
of
his
face
told
her
that
he
had
not
forgotten
the
that
his
decision
remained
in
and
only
the
presence
of
visitors
hindered
his
speaking
of
it
to
her
when
they
went
into
the
drawing
room
where
coffee
was
the
old
men
sat
prince
nicholas
grew
more
animated
and
expressed
his
views
on
the
impending
he
said
that
our
wars
with
bonaparte
would
be
disastrous
so
long
as
we
sought
alliances
with
the
germans
and
thrust
ourselves
into
european
into
which
we
had
been
drawn
by
the
peace
of
ought
not
to
fight
either
for
or
against
our
political
interests
are
all
in
the
and
in
regard
to
bonaparte
the
only
thing
is
to
have
an
armed
frontier
and
a
firm
and
he
will
never
dare
to
cross
the
russian
as
was
the
case
in
can
we
fight
the
said
count
we
arm
ourselves
against
our
teachers
and
look
at
our
look
at
our
the
french

began
speaking
evidently
to
be
heard
by
french
french
there
you
turned
metivier
out
by
the
scruff
of
his
neck

after

there
out

roman
catholics
and
had
the
indulgence
for
doing
woolwork

they
themselves
sit
there
nearly
like
the
signboards
at
our
public
baths
if
i
may
say
when
one
looks
at
our
young
one
would
like
to
take
peter
the
old
cudgel
out
of
the
museum
and
belabor
them
in
the
russian
way
till
all
the
nonsense

out
of
all

at

a
smile
and
wagged

head

briskness

wondered
whether
the

had
all
observed

special

and
confide
her
grief
to

she
only
repeated
that
she
begged
him
to

what
she

not
remember
what
she
had
and
that
she
had

honestly
the
whole
what

what
do

you

andrew
is
risking
so
much
doing
this
against
his
will
that
i
should
like
to
an
undefined
instinct
told
pierre
that
these
and
repeated
requests
to
be
told
the
whole
expressed
on
the
part
toward
her
future
and
a
wish
that
he
should
disapprove
of
but
in
reply
he
said
what
he
felt
rather
than
what
he
know
how
to
answer
your
he
blushing
without
knowing
really
know
what
sort
of
girl
she
i
analyze
her
at
she
is
but
what
makes
her
so
i
that
is
all
one
can
say
about
princess
mary
and
the
expression
on
her
face
what
i
expected

she
she
pierre

he
she
does
not
deign
to
be
oh
she
is
simply
and
that
is
princess
mary
again
shook
her
head
i
so
long
to
like
tell
her
so
if
you
see
her
before
i
hear
they
are
expected
very
said
princess
mary
told
pierre
of
her
plan
to
become
intimate
with
her
future
as
soon
as
the
rostovs
arrived
and
to
try
to
accustom
the
old
prince
to
chapter
v
boris
had
not
succeeded
in
making
a
wealthy
match
in
so
with
the
same
object
in
view
he
came
to
there
he
wavered
between
the
two
richest
julie
and
princess
though
princess
mary
despite
her
plainness
seemed
to
him
more
attractive
than
without
knowing
felt
awkward
about
paying
court
to
when
they
had
last
met
on
the
old
name
she
had
answered
at
random
all
his
attempts
to
talk
evidently
not
listening
to
what
he
was
julie
on
the
contrary
accepted
his
attentions
though
in
a
manner
peculiar
to
she
was
after
the
death
of
her
brothers
she
had
become
very
she
was
by
now
decidedly
but
thought
herself
not
merely
as
as
before
but
even
far
more
she
was
confirmed
in
this
delusion
by
the
fact
that
she
had
become
a
very
wealthy
heiress
and
also
by
the
fact
that
the
older
she
grew
the
less
dangerous
she
became
to
and
the
more
freely
they
could
associate
with
her
and
avail
themselves
of
her
and
the
animated
company
that
assembled
at
her
without
incurring
any
a
man
who
would
have
been
afraid
ten
years
before
of
going
every
day
to
the
house
when
there
was
a
girl
of
seventeen
for
fear
of
compromising
her
and
committing

now
go
boldly
every
day
and
treat
her
not
as
a
marriageable
girl
but
as
a
sexless

winter
the
house
was
the
most
agreeable
and
hospitable
in
in
addition
to
the
formal
evening
and
dinner
a
large

there
every
supping
at
midnight
and
staying
till
three
in
the
julie
never
missed
a
a
or
a
her
dresses
were
always
of
the
latest
but
in
spite
of
that
she
seemed
to
be
disillusioned
about
everything
and
told
everyone
that
she
did
not
believe
either
in
friendship
or
in
or
any
of
the
joys
of
and
expected
peace
only
she
adopted
the
tone
of
one
who
has
suffered
a
great
like
a
girl
who
has
either
lost
the
man
she
loved
or
been
cruelly
deceived
by
though
nothing
of
the
kind
had
happened
to
her
she
was
regarded
in
that
and
had
even
herself
come
to
believe
that
she
had
suffered
much
in
this
which
did
not
prevent
her
amusing
did
not
hinder
the
young
people
who
came
to
her
house
from
passing
the
time
every
visitor
who
came
to
the
house
paid
his
tribute
to
the
melancholy
mood
of
the
and
then
amused
himself
with
society

and
bouts
which
were
in
vogue
at
the
only
a
few
of
these
young
among
them
entered
more
deeply
into
and
with
these
she
had
prolonged
conversations
in
private
on
the
vanity
of
all
worldly
and
to
them
she
showed
her
albums
filled
with
mournful
and
to
julie
was
particularly
she
regretted
his
early
disillusionment
with

him
such
consolation
of
friendship
as
she
who
had
herself
suffered
so
much
could

showed
him

trees
in
the

your
dark

shed
gloom
and
melancholy

more
than

because
of
the
emotions
that
choked

at

gatherings
julie
and
boris
looked
on
one

boris
smiled
almost
imperceptibly
while
listening
to
his
he
laughed
blandly
at
her
naive
diplomacy
but
listened
to
what
she
had
to
and
sometimes
questioned
her
carefully
about
the
penza
and
nizhegorod
julie
had
long
been
expecting
a
proposal
from
her
melancholy
adorer
and
was
ready
to
accept
but
some
secret
feeling
of
repulsion
for
for
her
passionate
desire
to
get
for
her
and
a
feeling
of
horror
at
renouncing
the
possibility
of
real
love
still
restrained
his
leave
was
he
spent
every
day
and
whole
days
at
the
and
every
day
on
thinking
the
matter
over
told
himself
that
he
would
propose
but
in
looking
at
her
red
face
and
chin
always
her
moist
and
her
expression
of
continual
readiness
to
pass
at
once
from
melancholy
to
an
unnatural
rapture
of
married
boris
could
not
utter
the
decisive
though
in
imagination
he
had
long
regarded
himself
as
the
possessor
of
those
penza
and
nizhegorod
estates
and
had
apportioned
the
use
of
the
income
from
julie
saw
and
sometimes
the
thought
occurred
to
her
that
she
was
repulsive
to
but
her
feminine
immediately
supplied
her
with
and
she
told
herself
that
he
was
only
shy
from
her

to
turn
to

not
long
before
departure
she
formed
a
definite
plan
of
just

absence
was
anatole
kuragin
made
his
appearance
in

of
course
in
the
drawing
and
suddenly
abandoning
her
became
cheerful
and
very
attentive
to
said
anna
mikhaylovna
to
her
know
from
a
reliable
source
that
prince
vasili
has
sent
his
son
to
moscow
to
get
him
married
to
i
am
so
fond
of
julie
that
i
should
be
sorry
for
what
do
you
think
of
my
the
idea
of
being
made
a
fool
of
and
of
having
thrown
away
that
whole
month
of
arduous
melancholy
service
to
and
of
seeing
all
the
revenue
from
the
penza
estates
which
he
had
already
mentally
apportioned
and
put
to
proper
use
fall
into
the
hands
of

especially
into
the
hands
of
that

the
firm
intention
of
julie

him
in
a
careless
spoke
casually
of
how
she
had
enjoyed
and
asked
when
he
was
though
boris
had
come
intentionally
to
speak
of
his
love
and
therefore
meant
to
be
he
began
speaking
irritably
of
feminine
of
how
easily
women
can
turn
from
sadness
to
and
how
their
moods
depend
solely
on
who
happens
to
be
paying
court
to
julie
was
offended
and
replied
that
it
was
true
that
a
woman
needs
and
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again
would
weary
i
should
advise
boris
wishing
to
sting
but
at
that
instant
the
galling
thought
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
have
to
leave
moscow
without
having
accomplished
his
and
have
vainly
wasted
his
was
a
thing
he
never
allowed
to
he
checked
himself
in
the
middle
of
the
lowered
his
eyes
to
avoid
seeing
her
unpleasantly
irritated
and
irresolute
and
did
not
come
here
at
all
to
quarrel
with
on
the
he
glanced
at
her
to
make
sure
that
he
might
go

irritability
had
suddenly
quite
and
her
imploring
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
with
greedy
can
always
arrange
so
as
not
to
see
her
thought
affair
has
been
begun
and
must
be

blushed
raised
his
eyes
to
and
know
my
feelings
for
there
was
no
need
to
say
face
shone
with
triumph
and
but
she
forced
boris
to
say
all
that
is
said
on
such
he
loved
her
and
had
never
loved
any
other
woman
more
than
she
knew
that
for
the
penza
estates
and
nizhegorod
forests
she
could
demand
and
she

held
herself
as
told
everyone
her
opinion
as
and
bluntly
as

her
whole
bearing
seemed
a
reproach
to
others
for
any
or
possibility

she
did
not
from
early
in
the
wearing

natasha
remained
from
shyness
marya
dmitrievna
but
really
because
she
disliked
anyone
interfering
in
what
touched
her
love
of
prince
which
seemed
to
her
so
apart
from
all
human
affairs
that
no
one
could
understand
she
loved
and
knew
prince

loved
her
and

to

next
by
marya
count
rostov
took
natasha
to
call
on
prince
nicholas
the
count
did
not
set
out
cheerfully
on
this
at
heart
he
felt
he
well
remembered
the
last
interview
he
had
had
with
the
old
prince
at
the
time
of
the
when
in
reply
to
an
invitation
to
dinner
he
had
had
to
listen
to
an
angry
reprimand
for
not
having
provided
his
full
quota
of
on
the
other
having
put
on
her
best
was
in
the
highest
help
liking
she
always
has
liked
and
i
am
so
willing
to
do
anything
they
so
ready
to
be
fond
of
being
his
of
being
his
that
there
is
no
reason
for
them
not
to
like
they
drove
up
to
the
gloomy
old
house
on
the
vozdvizhenka
and
entered
the
the
lord
have
mercy
on
said
the
half
in
half
in
but
natasha
noticed
that
her
father
was
flurried
on
entering
the
anteroom
and
inquired
timidly
and
softly
whether
the
prince
and
princess
were
at
when
they
had
been
announced
a
perturbation
was
noticeable
among
the
the
footman
who
had
gone
to
announce
them
was
stopped
by
another
in
the
large
hall
and
they
whispered
to
one
then
a
maidservant
ran
into
the
hall
and
hurriedly
said
mentioning
the
at
last
an
cross
looking
footman
came
and
announced
to
the
rostovs
that
the
prince
was
not
but
that
the
princess
begged
them
to
walk
the
first
person
who
came
to
meet
the
visitors
was
mademoiselle
she
greeted
the
father
and
daughter
with
special
politeness
and
showed
them
to
the
the
looking
excited
and
her
face
flushed
in
ran
in
to
meet
the
treading
and
vainly
trying
to
appear
cordial
and
at
from
the
first
glance
princess
mary
did
not
like
she
thought
her
too
fashionably
frivolously
gay
and
she
did
not
at
all
realize
that
before
having
seen
her
future
she
was
prejudiced
against
her
by
involuntary
envy
of
her
and
as
well
as
by
jealousy
of
her
love
for
apart
from
this
insuperable
antipathy
to
princess
mary
was
agitated
just
then
because
on
the
being
the
old
prince
had
shouted
that
he
did
not
wish
to
see
that
princess
mary
might
do
so
if
she
but
they
were
not
to
be
admitted
to
she
had
decided
to
receive
but
feared
lest
the
prince
might
at
any
moment
indulge
in
some
as
he
seemed
much
upset
by
the
my
dear
brought
you
my
said
the
bowing
and
looking
round
uneasily
as
if
afraid
the
old
prince
might
am
so
glad
you
should
get
to
know
one
very
sorry
the
prince
is
still
and
after
a
few
more
commonplace
remarks
he
allow
me
to
leave
my
natasha
in
your
hands
for
a
quarter
of
an
drive
round
to
see
anna
quite
near
in
the
and
then
come
back
for
the
count
had
devised
this
diplomatic
ruse
he
afterwards
told
his
to
give
the
future
an
opportunity
to
talk
to
one
another
but
another
motive
was
to
avoid
the
danger
of
encountering
the
old
of
whom
he
was
he
did
not
mention
this
to
his
but
natasha
noticed
her
nervousness
and
anxiety
and
felt
mortified
by
she
blushed
for
grew
still
angrier
at
having
and
looked
at
the
princess
with
a
bold
and
defiant
expression
which
said
that
she
was
not
afraid
of
the
princess
told
the
count
that
she
would
be
and
only
begged
him
to
stay
longer
at
anna
and
he
despite
the
uneasy
glances
thrown
at
her
by
princess
wished
to
have
a
with
bourienne
remained
in
the
room
and
persistently
talked
about
moscow
amusements
and
natasha
felt
offended
by
the
hesitation
she
had
noticed
in
the
by
her
and
by
the
unnatural
manner
of
the
princess
making
a
favor
of
receiving
and
so
everything
displeased
she
did
not
like
princess
whom
she
thought
very
and
natasha
suddenly
shrank
into
herself
and
involuntarily
assumed
an
offhand
air
which
alienated
princess
mary
still
after
five
minutes
of
constrained
they
heard
the
sound
of
slippered
feet
rapidly
princess
mary
looked
the
door
opened
and
the
old
in
a
dressing
gown
and
a
white
came
he
countess
if
i
am
not
i
beg
you
to
excuse
to
excuse
i
did
not
god
is
my
i
did
not
know
you
had
honored
us
with
a
and
i
came
in
such
a
costume
only
to
see
my
i
beg
you
to
excuse
god
is
my
i
he
stressing
the
word
so
unnaturally
and
so
unpleasantly
that
princess
mary
stood
with
downcast
eyes
not
daring
to
look
either
at
her
father
or
at
nor
did
the
having
risen
and
know
what
to
mademoiselle
bourienne
alone
smiled
beg
you
to
excuse
excuse
god
is
my
i
did
not
muttered
the
old
and
after
looking
natasha
over
from
head
to
foot
he
went
mademoiselle
bourienne
was
the
first
to
recover
herself
after
this
apparition
and
began
speaking
about
the
natasha
and
princess
mary
looked
at
one
another
in
and
the
longer
they
did
so
without
saying
what
they
wanted
to
the
greater
grew
their
antipathy
to
one
when
the
count
natasha
was
impolitely
pleased
and
hastened
to
get
at
that
moment
she
hated
the
elderly
who
could
place
her
in
such
an
embarrassing
position
and
had
spent
half
an
hour
with
her
without
once
mentioning
prince
begin
talking
about
him
in
the
presence
of
that
thought
the
same
thought
was
meanwhile
tormenting
princess
she
knew
what
she
ought
to
have
said
to
but
she
had
been
unable
to
say
it
because
mademoiselle
bourienne
was
in
the
and
without
knowing
she
felt
it
very
difficult
to
speak
of
the
when
the
count
was
already
leaving
the
princess
mary
went
up
hurriedly
to
took
her
by
the
and
said
with
a
deep
i
natasha
glanced
at
her
ironically
without
knowing
said
princess
want
you
to
know
that
i
am
glad
my
brother
has
found
she
feeling
that
she
was
not
telling
the
natasha
noticed
this
and
guessed
its
it
is
not
convenient
to
speak
of
that
she
said
with
external
dignity
and
though
she
felt
the
tears
choking
have
i
said
and
what
have
i
thought
as
soon
as
she
was
out
of
the
they
waited
a
long
time
for
natasha
to
come
to
dinner
that
she
sat
in
her
room
crying
like
a
blowing
her
nose
and
sonya
stood
beside
kissing
her
what
is
it
she
do
they
matter
to
it
will
all
if
you
only
knew
how
offensive
it
as
if
talk
about
it
your
fault
so
why
should
you
kiss
said
natasha
raised
her
head
kissing
her
friend
on
the
pressed
her
wet
face
against
tell
i
no
to
said
my
but
it
all
hurts
why
he
she
came
in
to
dinner
with
red
marya
who
knew
how
the
prince
had
received
the
pretended
not
to
notice
how
upset
natasha
was
and
jested
resolutely
and
loudly
at
table
with
the
count
and
the
other
chapter
viii
that
evening
the
rostovs
went
to
the
for
which
marya
dmitrievna
had
taken
a
natasha
did
not
want
to
but
could
not
refuse
marya
kind
offer
which
was
intended
expressly
for
when
she
came
ready
dressed
into
the
ballroom
to
await
her
and
looking
in
the
large
mirror
there
saw
that
she
was
very
she
felt
even
more
but
it
was
a
tender
if
he
were
here
now
i
would
not
behave
as
i
did
but
i
would
not
be
silly
and
afraid
of
i
would
simply
embrace
cling
to
and
make
him
look
at
me
with
those
searching
inquiring
eyes
with
which
he
has
so
often
looked
at
and
then
i
would
make
him
laugh
as
he
used
to
and
his
i
see
those
thought
what
do
his
father
and
sister
matter
to
i
love
him
with
that
face
and
those
with
his
manly
and
yet
i
had
better
not
think
of
not
think
of
him
but
forget
quite
forget
him
for
the
i
bear
this
waiting
and
i
shall
cry
in
a
and
she
turned
away
from
the
making
an
effort
not
to
how
can
sonya
love
nicholas
so
calmly
and
quietly
and
wait
so
long
and
so
thought
looking
at
who
also
came
in
quite
with
a
fan
in
her
altogether
i
natasha
at
that
moment
felt
so
softened
and
tender
that
it
was
not
enough
for
her
to
love
and
know
she
was
she
wanted
at
to
embrace
the
man
she
to
speak
and
hear
from
him
words
of
love
such
as
filled
her
while
she
sat
in
the
carriage
beside
her
pensively
watching
the
lights
of
the
street
lamps
flickering
on
the
frozen
she
felt
still
sadder
and
more
in
and
forgot
where
she
was
going
and
with
having
fallen
into
the
line
of
the
carriage
drove
up
to
the
its
wheels
squeaking
over
the
natasha
and
holding
up
their
jumped
out
the
count
got
out
helped
by
the
passing
among
men
and
women
who
were
entering
and
the
program
they
all
three
went
along
the
corridor
to
the
first
row
of
through
the
closed
doors
the
music
was
already
your
whispered
an
attendant
deferentially
and
quickly
slipped
before
the
ladies
and
opened
the
door
of
their
the
music
sounded
louder
and
through
the
door
rows
of
brightly
lit
boxes
in
which
ladies
sat
with
bare
arms
and
and
noisy
stalls
brilliant
with

before
their
a
lady
entering
the
next
box
shot
a
glance
of
feminine
envy
at
the
curtain
had
not
yet
risen
and
the
overture
was
being
smoothing
her
went
in
with
sonya
and
sat
scanning
the
brilliant
tiers
of
boxes
a
sensation
she
had
not
experienced
for
a
long
of
hundreds
of
eyes
looking
at
her
bare
arms
and
affected
her
both
agreeably
and
disagreeably
and
called
up
a
whole
crowd
of
desires
and
emotions
associated
with
that
the
two
remarkably
pretty
natasha
and
with
count
rostov
who
had
not
been
seen
in
moscow
for
a
long
attracted
general
everybody
knew
vaguely
of
engagement
to
prince
and
knew
that
the
rostovs
had
lived
in
the
country
ever
and
all
looked
with
curiosity
at
a
fiancee
who
was
making
one
of
the
best
matches
in
as
everyone
told
had
improved
in
the
and
that
evening
thanks
to
her
agitation
she
was
particularly
she
struck
those
who
saw
her
by
her
fullness
of
life
and
combined
with
her
indifference
to
everything
about
her
black
eyes
looked
at
the
crowd
without
seeking
and
her
delicate
bare
to
above
the
lay
on
the
velvet
edge
of
the

she
opened
and
closed

coming
into
the
natasha
looked
in
the
direction
in
which
her
eyes
were
turned
and
saw
julie
sitting
beside
her
mother
with
a
happy
look
on
her
face
and
a
string
of
pearls
round

looked
at
the
rostovs
from
under
his
brows
and
said
to
his

no
doubt
is
calming
her
jealousy
of

they
knew
how
little
i
am
concerned
about
any

sat

a
green
headdress
and
with
a
happy
look
of
resignation
to
the
will
of
god
on
her
their
box
was
pervaded
by
that
atmosphere
of
an
affianced
couple
which
natasha
knew
so
well
and
liked
so
she
turned
away
and
suddenly
remembered
all
that
had
been
so
humiliating
in
her
right

to
receive

in

much
at
ease
as
though
he
were
in

the

took
a
long
time

into

admired
the
beauty
of

the

she
was

whispered
to
answered
a
woman
one
could
easily
fall
in
love
just
then
the
last
chords
of
the
overture
were
heard
and
the
conductor
tapped
with
his
some
latecomers
took
their
seats
in
the
and
the
curtain
as
soon
as
it
rose
everyone
in
the
boxes
and
stalls
became
and
all
the
old
and
in
uniform
and
evening
and
all
the
women
with
gems
on
their
bare
turned
their
whole
attention
with
eager
curiosity
to
the
natasha
too
began
to
look
at
chapter
ix
the
floor
of
the
stage
consisted
of
smooth
at
the
sides
was
some
painted
cardboard
representing
and
at
the
back
was
a
cloth
stretched
over
in
the
center
of
the
stage
sat
some
girls
in
red
bodices
and
white
one
very
fat
girl
in
a
white
silk
dress
sat
apart
on
a
low
to
the
back
of
which
a
piece
of
green
cardboard
was
they
all
sang
when
they
had
finished
their
song
the
girl
in
white
went
up
to
the
box
and
a
man
with
tight
silk
trousers
over
his
stout
and
holding
a
plume
and
a
went
up
to
her
and
began
waving
his
arms
first
the
man
in
the
tight
trousers
sang
then
she
then
they
both
paused
while
the
orchestra
played
and
the
man
fingered
the
hand
of
the
girl
in
obviously
awaiting
the
beat
to
start
singing
with
they
sang
together
and
everyone
in
the
theater
began
clapping
and
while
the
man
and
woman
on
the
represented
began
spreading
out
their
and
after
her
life
in
the
and
in
her
present
serious
all
this
seemed
grotesque
and
amazing
to
she
could
not
follow
the
opera
nor
even
listen
to
the
she
saw
only
the
painted
cardboard
and
the
queerly
dressed
men
and
women
who
and
sang
so
strangely
in
that
brilliant
she
knew
what
it
was
all
meant
to
but
it
was
so
pretentiously
false
and
unnatural
that
she
first
felt
ashamed
for
the
actors
and
then
amused
at
she
looked
at
the
faces
of
the
seeking
in
them
the
same
sense
of
ridicule
and
perplexity
she
herself
but
they
all
seemed
attentive
to
what
was
happening
on
the
and
expressed
delight
which
to
natasha
seemed
suppose
it
has
to
be
like
she
she
kept
looking
round
in
turn
at
the
rows
of
pomaded
heads
in
the
stalls
and
then
at
the
seminude
women
in
the
especially
at
helene
in
the
next
apparently
quite
with
a
quiet
tranquil
not
taking
her
eyes
off
the
and
feeling
the
bright
light
that
flooded
the
whole
place
and
the
warm
air
heated
by
the
natasha
little
by
little
began
to
pass
into
a
state
of
intoxication
she
had
not
experienced
for
a
long
she
did
not
realize
who
and
where
she
nor
what
was
going
on
before
as
she
looked
and
the
strangest
fancies
unexpectedly
and
disconnectedly
passed
through
her
the
idea
occurred
to
her
of
jumping
onto
the
edge
of
the
box
and
singing
the
air
the
actress
was
then
she
wished
to
touch
with
her
fan
an
old
gentleman
sitting
not
far
from
then
to
lean
over
to
helene
and
tickle
at
a
moment
when
all
was
quiet
before
the
commencement
of
a
a
door
leading
to
the
stalls
on
the
side
nearest
the
box
and
the
steps
of
a
belated
arrival
were
whispered
countess
bezukhova
turned
smiling
to
the
and
following
the
direction
of
that
saw
an
exceptionally
handsome
adjutant
approaching
their
box
with
a
yet
courteous
this
was
anatole
kuragin
whom
she
had
seen
and
noticed
long
ago
at
the
ball
in
he
was
now
in
an
uniform
with
one
epaulet
and
a
shoulder
he
moved
with
a
restrained
swagger
which
would
have
been
ridiculous
had
he
not
been
so
and
had
his
handsome
face
not
worn
such
an
expression
of
complacency
and
though
the
performance
was
he
walked
deliberately
down
the
carpeted
his
sword
and
spurs
slightly
jingling
and
his
handsome
perfumed
head
held
having
looked
at
natasha
he
approached
his
laid
his
well
gloved
hand
on
the
edge
of
her
nodded
to
and
leaning
forward
asked
a
with
a
motion
toward
said
evidently
referring
to
who
did
not
exactly
hear
his
words
but
understood
them
from
the
movement
of
his
then
he
took
his
place
in
the
first
row
of
the
stalls
and
sat
down
beside
nudging
with
his
elbow
in
a
friendly
and
offhand
way
that
dolokhov
whom
others
treated
so
he
winked
at
him
and
rested
his
foot
against
the
orchestra
like
the
brother
is
to
the
remarked
the
how
handsome
they
both
lowering
his
began
to
tell
the
count
of
some
intrigue
of
in
and
natasha
tried
to
overhear
it
just
because
he
had
said
she
was
the
first
act
was
in
the
stalls
everyone
began
moving
going
out
and
coming
boris
came
to
the
received
their
congratulations
very
and
raising
his
eyebrows
with
an
smile
conveyed
to
natasha
and
sonya
his
invitation
to
her
and
went
natasha
with
a
coquettish
smile
talked
to
and
congratulated
on
his
approaching
wedding
that
same
boris
with
whom
she
had
formerly
been
in
in
the
state
of
intoxication
she
was
everything
seemed
simple
and
the
scantily
clad
helene
smiled
at
everyone
in
the
same
and
natasha
gave
boris
a
similar
box
was
filled
and
surrounded
from
the
stalls
by
the
most
distinguished
and
intellectual
who
seemed
to
vie
with
one
another
in
their
wish
to
let
everyone
see
that
they
knew
during
the
whole
of
that
kuragin
stood
with
dolokhov
in
front
of
the
orchestra
looking
at
the
natasha
knew
he
was
talking
about
her
and
this
afforded
her
she
even
turned
so
that
he
should
see
her
profile
in
what
she
thought
was
its
most
becoming
before
the
beginning
of
the
second
act
pierre
appeared
in
the
the
rostovs
had
not
seen
him
since
their
his
face
looked
and
he
had
grown
still
stouter
since
natasha
last
saw
he
passed
up
to
the
front
not
noticing
anatole
went
up
to
him
and
began
speaking
to
looking
at
and
indicating
the
on
seeing
natasha
pierre
grew
animated
hastily
passing
between
the
came
toward
their
when
he
got
there
he
leaned
on
his
elbows
talked
to
her
for
a
long
while
conversing
with
natasha
heard
a
voice
in
countess
box
and
something
told
her
it
was
she
turned
and
their
eyes
almost
he
gazed
straight
into
her
eyes
with
such
an
enraptured
caressing
look
that
it
seemed
strange
to
be
so
near
to
look
at
him
like
to
be
so
sure
he
admired
and
not
to
be
acquainted
with
in
the
second
act
there
was
scenery
representing
there
was
a
round
hole
in
the
canvas
to
represent
the
shades
were
raised
over
the
and
from
horns
and
contrabass
came
deep
notes
while
many
people
appeared
from
right
and
left
wearing
black
cloaks
and
holding
things
like
daggers
in
their
they
began
waving
their
then
some
other
people
ran
in
and
began
dragging
away
the
maiden
who
had
been
in
white
and
was
now
in
light
they
did
not
drag
her
away
at
but
sang
with
her
for
a
long
time
and
then
at
last
dragged
her
and
behind
the
scenes
something
metallic
was
struck
three
times
and
everyone
knelt
down
and
sang
a
all
these
things
were
repeatedly
interrupted
by
the
enthusiastic
shouts
of
the
during
this
act
every
time
natasha
looked
toward
the
stalls
she
saw
anatole
kuragin
with
an
arm
thrown
across
the
back
of
his
staring
at
she
was
pleased
to
see
that
he
was
captivated
by
her
and
it
did
not
occur
to
her
that
there
was
anything
wrong
in
when
the
second
act
was
over
countess
bezukhova
turned
to
the
whole
bosom
completely
the
old
count
with
a
gloved
and
paying
no
attention
to
those
who
had
entered
her
box
began
talking
to
him
with
an
amiable
make
me
acquainted
with

singing
their
praises
and
i

natasha
rose
and
curtsied
to
the
splendid

so
pleased
by
praise
from
this
brilliant
beauty
that
she
blushed
with
want
to
become
a
moscovite
said
is
it
not
ashamed
to
bury
such
pearls
in
the
countess
bezukhova

her
reputation
of
being
a
fascinating

on
with
special
implying
that

get
better
acquainted
she
asked
that
one
of
the
young
ladies
should
come
into
her
box
for
the
rest
of
the
and
natasha
moved
over
to
the
scene
of
the
third
act
represented
a
palace
in
which
many
candles
were
burning
and
pictures
of
knights
with
short
beards
hung
on
the
in
the
middle
stood
what
were
probably
a
king
and
a
the
king
waved
his
right
arm
evidently
sang
something
badly
and
sat
down
on
a
crimson
the
maiden
who
had
been
first
in
white
and
then
in
light
now
wore
only
a
and
stood
beside
the
throne
with
her
hair
she
sang
something
addressing
the
but
the
king
waved
his
arm
and
men
and
women
with
bare
legs
came
in
from
both
sides
and
began
dancing
all
then
the
violins
played
very
shrilly
and
merrily
and
one
of
the
women
with
thick
bare
legs
and
thin
separating
from
the
went
behind
the
adjusted
her
returned
to
the
middle
of
the
and
began
jumping
and
striking
one
foot
rapidly
against
the
in
the
stalls
everyone
clapped
and
shouted
then
one
of
the
men
went
into
a
corner
of
the
the
cymbals
and
horns
in
the
orchestra
struck
up
more
and
this
man
with
bare
legs
jumped
very
high
and
waved
his
feet
about
very
was
who
received
sixty
thousand
rubles
a
year
for
this
everybody
in
the
and
galleries
began
clapping
and
shouting
with
all
their
and
the
man
stopped
and
began
smiling
and
bowing
to
all
then
other
men
and
women
danced
with
bare
then
the
king
again
shouted
to
the
sound
of
and
they
all
began
but
suddenly
a
storm
came
chromatic
scales
and
diminished
sevenths
were
heard
in
the
everyone
ran
again
dragging
one
of
their
number
and
the
curtain
once
more
there
was
a
terrible
noise
and
clatter
among
the
and
with
rapturous
faces
everyone
began
natasha
no
longer
thought
this
she
looked
about
with
smiling
duport
helene
asked
replied
chapter
x
during
the
a
whiff
of
cold
air
came
into
the
door
and
anatole
stooping
and
trying
not
to
brush
against
me
introduce
my
brother
to
said
her
eyes
shifting
uneasily
from
natasha
to
natasha
turned
her
pretty
little
head
toward
the
elegant
young
officer
and
smiled
at
him
over
her
bare
who
was
as
handsome
at
close
quarters
as
at
a
sat
down
beside
her
and
told
her
he
had
long
wished
to
have
this
since
the
ball
in
at
which
he
had
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
kuragin
was
much
more
sensible
and
simple
with
women
than
among
he
talked
boldly
and
and
natasha
was
strangely
and
agreeably
struck
by
the
fact
that
there
was
nothing
formidable
in
this
man
about
whom
there
was
so
much
but
that
on
the
contrary
his
smile
was
most
and
kuragin
asked
her
opinion
of
the
performance
and
told
her
how
at
a
previous
performance
semenova
had
fallen
down
on
the
do
you
he
suddenly
addressing
her
as
an
familiar
are
getting
up
a
costume
you
ought
to
take
part
in
it
will
be
great
we
shall
all
meet
at
the
please
said
while
saying
this
he
never
removed
his
smiling
eyes
from
her
her
and
her
bare
natasha
knew
for
certain
that
he
was
enraptured
by
this
pleased
yet
his
presence
made
her
feel
constrained
and
when
she
was
not
looking
at
him
she
felt
that
he
was
looking
at
her
and
she
involuntarily
caught
his
eye
so
that
he
should
look
into
hers
rather
than
but
looking
into
his
eyes
she
was
realizing
that
there
was
not
that
barrier
of
modesty
she
had
always
felt
between
herself
and
other
she
did
not
know
how
it
was
that
within
five
minutes
she
had
come
to
feel
herself
terribly
near
to
this
when
she
turned
away
she
feared
he
might
seize
her
from
behind
by
her
bare
arm
and
kiss
her
on
the
they
spoke
of
most
ordinary
yet
she
felt
that
they
were
closer
to
one
another
than
she
had
ever
been
to
any
natasha
kept
turning
to
helene
and
to
her
as
if
asking
what
it
all
but
helene
was
engaged
in
conversation
with
a
general
and
did
not
answer
her
and
her
eyes
said
nothing
but
what
they
always
a
good
glad
of
during
one
of
these
moments
of
awkward
silence
when
prominent
eyes
were
gazing
calmly
and
fixedly
at
to
break
the
asked
him
how
he
liked
she
asked
the
question
and
she
felt
all
the
time
that
by
talking
to
him
she
was
doing
something
anatole
smiled
as
though
to
encourage
first
i
did
not
like
it
because
what
makes
a
town
pleasant
ce
sont
les
jolies
that
but
now
i
like
it
very
much
he
looking
at
her
come
to
the
costume
do
and
putting
out
his
hand
to
her
bouquet
and
dropping
his
he
will
be
the
prettiest
do
dear
and
give
me
this
flower
as
a
are
the
pretty
natasha
did
not
understand
what
he
was
saying
any
more
than
he
did
but
she
felt
that
his
incomprehensible
words
had
an
improper
she
did
not
know
what
to
say
and
turned
away
as
if
she
had
not
heard
his
but
as
soon
as
she
had
turned
away
she
felt
that
he
was
so
close
behind
is
he
ought
i
to
put
it
she
asked
and
she
could
not
refrain
from
turning
she
looked
straight
into
his
and
his
and
the
natured
tenderness
of
his
smile
vanquished
she
smiled
just
as
he
was
gazing
straight
into
his
and
again
she
felt
with
horror
that
no
barrier
lay
between
him
and
the
curtain
rose
anatole
left
the
serene
and
natasha
went
back
to
her
father
in
the
other
now
quite
submissive
to
the
world
she
found
herself
all
that
was
going
on
before
her
now
seemed
quite
but
on
the
other
hand
all
her
previous
thoughts
of
her
of
princess
or
of
life
in
the
country
did
not
once
recur
to
her
mind
and
were
as
if
belonging
to
a
remote
in
the
fourth
act
there
was
some
sort
of
devil
who
sang
waving
his
arm
till
the
boards
were
withdrawn
from
under
him
and
he
disappeared
down
that
was
the
only
part
of
the
fourth
act
that
natasha
she
felt
agitated
and
and
the
cause
of
this
was
kuragin
whom
she
could
not
help
as
they
were
leaving
the
theater
anatole
came
up
to
called
their
and
helped
them
as
he
was
putting
natasha
in
he
pressed
her
arm
above
the
agitated
and
flushed
she
turned
he
was
looking
at
her
with
glittering
smiling
only
after
she
had
reached
home
was
natasha
able
clearly
to
think
over
what
had
happened
to
and
suddenly
remembering
prince
andrew
she
was
and
at
tea
to
which
all
had
sat
down
after
the
she
gave
a
loud
and
ran
out
of
the
i
am
she
said
to
could
i
let
she
sat
for
a
long
time
hiding
her
flushed
face
in
her
hands
trying
to
realize
what
had
happened
to
but
was
unable
either
to
understand
what
had
happened
or
what
she
everything
seemed
and
there
in
that
illuminated
theater
where
the
legged
in
a
jumped
about
to
the
music
on
wet
and
young
girls
and
old
and
the
nearly
naked
helene
with
her
calm
rapturously
cried
in
the
presence
of
that
helene
it
had
all
seemed
clear
and
but
alone
by
it
was
is
what
was
that
terror
i
felt
of
what
is
this
gnawing
of
conscience
i
am
feeling
she
only
to
the
old
countess
at
night
in
bed
could
natasha
have
told
all
she
was
she
knew
that
sonya
with
her
severe
and
simple
views
would
either
not
understand
it
at
all
or
would
be
horrified
at
such
a
so
natasha
tried
to
solve
what
was
torturing
her
by
i
spoiled
for
love
or
she
asked
and
with
soothing
irony
a
fool
i
am
to
ask
what
did
happen
to
i
have
done
i
lead
him
on
at
nobody
will
know
and
i
shall
never
see
him
she
told
it
is
plain
that
nothing
has
happened
and
there
is
nothing
to
repent
and
andrew
can
love
me
but
why
o
why
he
natasha
quieted
herself
for
a
but
again
some
instinct
told
her
that
though
all
this
was
and
though
nothing
had
yet
the
former
purity
of
her
love
for
prince
andrew
had
and
again
in
imagination
she
went
over
her
whole
conversation
with

again
saw
the
and
tender
smile
of
that
bold
handsome
man
when
he
pressed

staying
in
moscow
because
his
father
had
sent
him
away
from

he
had
been
spending
twenty
thousand
rubles
a
year
in
besides
running
up
debts
for
as
much
which
his
creditors
demanded
from
his
his
father
announced
to
him
that
he
would
now
pay
half
his
debts
for
the
last
but
only
on
condition
that
he
went
to
moscow
as

had
procured
for

at
last
try
to
make
a
good
match
he
indicated
to
him

julie
anatole
consented
and
went
to
where
he
put
up
at
pierre
received
him
unwillingly
at

got
used
to
him
after
a
sometimes
even
accompanied
him
on
his
and
gave
him
money
under
the
guise
of
as
shinshin
had
from
the
time
of
his
arrival
anatole
had
turned
the
heads
of
the
moscow
especially
by
the
fact
that
he
slighted
them
and
plainly
preferred
the
gypsy
girls
and
french
the
chief
of
mademoiselle
he
was
said
to
be
on
intimate
he
had
never
missed
a
carousal
at
or
other
moscow
drank
whole
nights
outvying
everyone
and
was
at
all
the
balls
and
parties
of
the
best
there
was
talk
of
his
intrigues
with
some
of
the
and
he
flirted
with
a
few
of
them
at
the
but
he
did
not
run
after
the
unmarried
especially
the
rich
heiresses
who
were
most
of
them
there
was
a
special
reason
for
as
he
had
got
married
two
years

known
only
to
his
most
intimate
at
that
time
while
with
his
regiment
in
a
polish
landowner
of
small
means
had
forced
him
to
marry

very
soon
abandoned
his

for
a
payment

he
agreed
to
send

arranged
to
be
free
to
pass
himself
off

always
content
with
his
with
and
with
he
was
instinctively
and
thoroughly
convinced
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
live
otherwise
than
as
he
did
and
that
he
had
never
in
his
life
done
anything
he
was
incapable
of
considering
how
his
actions
might
affect
others
or
what
the
consequences
of
this
or
that
action
of
his
might

was
convinced
as
a

so
made
that
it
must
live
in

had
made
him
such
that
he
must
spend
thirty
thousand
rubles
a
year

always
occupy
a
prominent
position
in

believed
this
so
firmly
that
looking
at

persuaded
of
it
too
and
did
not
refuse
him
either
a
leading
place
in
society
or
which
he
borrowed
from
anyone
and
everyone

evidently
would

did
not

about

he
did
not
mind
what
people
thought
of
still
less

he
be
accused
of
more
than
once

had
vexed
his
father
by
spoiling
his

laughed
at

did
not

gaiety

and
as
according

his
ideas
there
was
nothing
dishonorable
in
these
and
he
was
incapable
of
considering
what
the
gratification
of
his
tastes
entailed

with
a
tranquil

the
day
after
the

the
rostovs
went
nowhere
and
nobody
came
to

marya
dmitrievna
talked
to
the
count
about
something
which
they
concealed
from
natasha
guessed
they
were
talking
about
the
old
prince
and
planning
and
this
disquieted
and
offended
she
was
expecting
prince
andrew
any
moment
and
twice
that
day
sent
a
manservant
to
the
vozdvizhenka
to
ascertain
whether

she
suffered
more
now
than
during
her
first
days
in
to
her
impatience
and
pining
for
him
were
now
added
the
unpleasant
recollection
of
her
interview
with
princess
mary
and
the
old
and
a
fear
and
anxiety
of
which
she
did
not
understand
the
she
continually
fancied
that
either
he
would
never
come
or
that
something
would
happen
to
her
before
he
she
could
no
longer
think
of
him
by
herself
calmly
and
continuously
as
she
had
done
as
soon
as
she
began
to
think
of
the
recollection
of
the
old
of
princess
of
the
and
of
kuragin
mingled
with
her
the
question
again
presented
itself
whether
she
was
not
whether
she
had
not
already
broken
faith
with
prince
and
again
she
found
herself
recalling
to
the
minutest
detail
every
every
and
every
shade
in
the
play
of
expression
on
the
face
of
the
man
who
had
been
able
to
arouse
in
her
such
an
incomprehensible
and
terrifying
to
the
family
natasha
seemed
livelier
than
but
she
was
far
less
tranquil
and
happy
than

were
extra

at

the

had
vodka
and
roast

in

in

on
that

as
she
had
put
on
a
bodice
without

and
only
tacked
and
was
turning
her
head
to
see
in
the
glass
how
the
back
she
heard
in
the
drawing
room
the
animated
sounds
of
her
voice
and
made

to

nodded
to

who
had
curtsied
respectfully
to

seated
herself
in
an
armchair
beside

folds
of
her
velvet

did
not
cease
chattering
and
continually
praising

looked
at

praised
as
well
as
a
new
dress

from

natasha
to

to
her
so
unapproachable
and
important

was
now
so
kind

up
and
felt
almost
in
love
with

delighted
with

replied
that

almost
entirely
of
men

after

count
he
went
up
to
natasha
and
followed
as
soon
as
she
saw
him
she
was
seized
by
the
same
feeling
she
had
had
at
the
vanity
at
his
admiration
of
her
and
fear
at
the
absence
of
a
moral
barrier

she
only
felt
herself
again
completely
borne
away
into
this
strange
senseless
remote
from
her
old
world
in
which
it
was
impossible
to
know
what

animated
and
looked
about
her
with
frightened
eyes
and
seemed
merrier
than
she
understood
hardly
anything
that
went
on
that
they
danced
the
ecossaise
and
the
her
father
asked
her
to
come
but
she
begged
to
wherever
she
went
and
whomever
she
was
speaking
she
felt
his
eyes
upon
later
on
she
recalled
how
she
had
asked
her
father
to
let
her
go
to
the
dressing
room
to
rearrange
her
that
helene
had
followed
her
and
spoken
laughingly
of
her
and
that
she
again
met
anatole
in
the
little
sitting
helene
had
disappeared
leaving
them
and
anatole
had
taken
her
hand
and
said
in
a
tender
cannot
come
to
visit
you
but
is
it
possible
that
i
shall
never
see
i
love
you
can
i
blocking
her
he
brought
his
face
close
to
his
masculine
eyes
were
so
close
to
hers
that
she
saw
nothing
but
he
whispered
inquiringly
while
she
felt
her
hands
being
painfully
i
have
nothing
to
her
eyes
burning
lips
were
pressed
to
and
at
the
same
instant
she
felt
herself
and
footsteps
and
the
rustle
of
her
dress
were
heard
in
the
natasha
looked
round
at
and
red
and
threw
a
frightened
look
of
inquiry
at
anatole
and
moved
toward
the
just
for
cried
she
she
so
wanted
a
word
from
him
that
would
explain
to
her
what
had
happened
and
to
which
she
could
find
no
just
a
only
he
kept
evidently
not
knowing
what
to
say
and
he
repeated
it
till
helene
came
up
to
helene
returned
with
natasha
to
the
drawing
the
rostovs
went
away
without
staying
for
after
reaching
home
natasha
did
not
sleep
all
she
was
tormented
by
the
insoluble
question
whether
she
loved
anatole
or
prince
she
loved
prince
remembered
distinctly
how
deeply
she
loved
but
she
also
loved
of
that
there
was
no
how
could
all
this
have
thought
after
i
could
return
his
smile
when
saying
if
i
was
able
to
let
it
come
to
it
means
that
i
loved
him
from
the
it
means
that
he
is
and
and
i
could
not
help
loving
what
am
i
to
do
if
i
love
him
and
the
other
one
she
asked
unable
to
find
an
answer
to
these
terrible
chapter
xiv
morning
came
with
its
cares
and
everyone
got
up
and
began
to
move
about
and
dressmakers
came
marya
dmitrievna
and
they
were
called
to
natasha
kept
looking
uneasily
at
everybody
with
as
if
wishing
to
intercept
every
glance
directed
toward
and
tried
to
appear
the
same
as
after
which
was
her
best
marya
dmitrievna
sat
down
in
her
armchair
and
called
natasha
and
the
count
to
i
have
now
thought
the
whole
matter
over
and
this
is
my
she
as
you
i
went
to
see
prince
i
had
a
talk
with
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
begin
but
i
am
not
one
to
be
shouted
i
said
what
i
had
to
and
asked
the
he
did
not
want
to
but
the
use
of
as
it
is
we
have
worn
the
poor
girl
said
marya
advice
to
you
is
finish
your
business
and
go
back
home
to
and
wait
exclaimed
go
said
marya
wait
if
your
betrothed
comes
here
will
be
no
avoiding
a
but
alone
with
the
old
man
he
will
talk
things
over
and
then
come
on
to
count
rostov
approved
of
this
appreciating
its
if
the
old
man
came
round
it
would
be
all
the
better
to
visit
him
in
moscow
or
at
bald
hills
later
and
if
the
against
his
could
only
be
arranged
at
is
perfectly
and
i
am
sorry
i
went
to
see
him
and
took
said
the
old
why
be
being
you
had
to
pay
your
but
if
he
his
said
marya
looking
for
something
in
her
the
trousseau
is
so
there
is
nothing
to
wait
and
what
is
not
ready
send
after
though
i
like
letting
you
it
is
the
best
so
with
having
found
what
she
was
looking
for
in
the
reticule
she
handed
it
to
it
was
a
letter
from
princess
has
written
to
how
she
torments
poor
afraid
you
might
think
that
she
does
not
like
she
like
said
talk
cried
marya
believe
i
know
she
like
replied
natasha
boldly
as
she
took
the
and
her
face
expressed
a
cold
and
angry
resolution
that
caused
marya
dmitrievna
to
look
at
her
more
intently
and
to
answer
like
my
good
she
i
say
is
write
an
natasha
did
not
reply
and
went
to
her
own
room
to
read
princess
princess
mary
wrote
that
she
was
in
despair
at
the
misunderstanding
that
had
occurred
between
whatever
her
feelings
might
she
begged
natasha
to
believe
that
she
could
not
help
loving
her
as
the
one
chosen
by
her
for
whose
happiness
she
was
ready
to
sacrifice
not
she
my
father
is
toward
he
is
an
invalid
and
an
old
man
who
must
be
but
he
is
good
and
magnanimous
and
will
love
her
who
makes
his
son
princess
mary
went
on
to
ask
natasha
to
fix
a
time
when
she
could
see
her
after
reading
the
letter
natasha
sat
down
at
the
writing
table
to
answer
she
wrote
in
french
quickly
and
and
then
what
more
could
she
write
after
all
that
had
happened
the
evening
all
that
has
and
now
all
is
she
thought
as
she
sat
with
the
letter
she
had
begun
before
i
break
off
with
must
i
and
to
escape
from
these
dreadful
thoughts
she
went
to
sonya
and
began
sorting
patterns
with
after
dinner
natasha
went
to
her
room
and
again
took
up
princess
it
be
that
it
is
all
she
it
be
that
all
this
has
happened
so
quickly
and
has
destroyed
all
that
went
she
recalled
her
love
for
prince
andrew
in
all
its
former
and
at
the
same
time
felt
that
she
loved
she
vividly
pictured
herself
as
prince
and
the
scenes
of
happiness
with
him
she
had
so
often
repeated
in
her
and
at
the
same
aglow
with
recalled
every
detail
of
interview
with
could
that
not
be
as
she
sometimes
asked
herself
in
complete
so
could
i
be
completely
but
now
i
have
to
and
i
be
happy
without
either
of
she
tell
prince
andrew
what
has
happened
or
to
hide
it
from
him
are
both
equally
but
with
that
one
nothing
is
but
am
i
really
to
abandon
forever
the
joy
of
prince
in
which
i
have
lived
so
whispered
a
maid
entering
the
room
with
a
mysterious
man
told
me
to
give
you
and
she
handed
natasha
a
for
the
girl
went
as
without
mechanically
broke
the
seal
and
read
a
love
letter
from
of
without
taking
in
a
she
understood
only
that
it
was
a
letter
from
the
man
she
she
loved
or
else
how
could
that
have
happened
which
had
and
how
could
she
have
a
love
letter
from
him
in
her
with
trembling
hands
natasha
held
that
passionate
love
letter
which
dolokhov
had
composed
for
and
as
she
read
it
she
found
in
it
an
echo
of
all
that
she
herself
imagined
she
was
yesterday
evening
my
fate
has
been
to
be
loved
by
you
or
to
there
is
no
other
way
for
the
letter
then
he
went
on
to
say
that
he
knew
her
parents
would
not
give
her
to
this
there
were
secret
reasons
he
could
reveal
only
to
that
if
she
loved
him
she
need
only
say
the
word
and
no
human
power
could
hinder
their
love
would
conquer
he
would
steal
her
away
and
carry
her
off
to
the
ends
of
the
i
love
thought
reading
the
letter
for
the
twentieth
time
and
finding
some
peculiarly
deep
meaning
in
each
word
of
that
evening
marya
dmitrievna
was
going
to
the
and
proposed
to
take
the
girls
with
pleading
a
remained
at
chapter
xv
on
returning
late
in
the
evening
sonya
went
to
and
to
her
surprise
found
her
still
dressed
and
asleep
on
the
open
on
the
beside
her
lay
sonya
picked
it
up
and
read
as
she
read
she
glanced
at
the
sleeping
trying
to
find
in
her
face
an
explanation
of
what
she
was
but
did
not
find
her
face
was
and
clutching
her
breast
to
keep
herself
from
pale
and
trembling
with
fear
and
sat
down
in
an
armchair
and
burst
into
was
it
i
noticed
how
could
it
go
so
can
she
have
left
off
loving
prince
and
how
could
she
let
kuragin
go
to
such
he
is
a
deceiver
and
a
what
will
dear
noble
do
when
he
hears
of
so
this
is
the
meaning
of
her
unnatural
look
the
day
before
and
thought
it
be
that
she
loves
she
probably
opened
the
letter
without
knowing
who
it
was
probably
she
is
offended
by
she
could
not
do
such
a
sonya
wiped
away
her
tears
and
went
up
to
again
scanning
her
she
just
natasha
awoke
and
saw
and
with
the
decision
and
tenderness
that
often
come
at
the
moment
of
she
embraced
her
but
noticing
look
of
her
own
face
expressed
confusion
and
read
that
she
answered
sonya
natasha
smiled
i
any
she
hide
it
from
you
any
you
we
love
one
he
sonya
stared
at
unable
to
believe
her
she
if
you
only
knew
how
happy
i
cried
know
what
love
can
that
be
all
natasha
looked
at
sonya
with
eyes
as
if
she
could
not
grasp
the
are
you
refusing
prince
said
you
understand
talk
just
said
with
momentary
i
believe
insisted
how
is
it
you
have
loved
a
man
for
a
whole
year
and
you
have
only
seen
him
three
i
believe
in
three
days
to
forget
everything
and
said
seems
to
me
loved
him
a
hundred
it
seems
to
me
that
i
have
never
loved
anyone
you
understand
wait
a
sit
and
natasha
embraced
and
kissed
had
heard
that
it
happens
like
and
you
must
have
heard
it
but
only
now
that
i
feel
such
not
the
same
as
as
soon
as
i
saw
him
i
felt
he
was
my
master
and
i
his
and
that
i
could
not
help
loving
his
whatever
he
orders
i
shall
you
understand
what
can
i
what
can
i
cried
natasha
with
a
happy
yet
frightened
think
what
you
are
cried
leave
it
like
this
secret
how
could
you
let
him
go
so
she
went
with
a
horror
and
disgust
she
could
hardly
told
you
that
i
have
no
natasha
you
i
love
i
let
it
come
to
i
shall
cried
bursting
into
do
you
for
if
you
you
are
my
declared
want
me
to
be
you
want

to
be
when
she
saw
sonya
shed
tears
of
shame
and
pity
for
her
what
has
happened
between
she
has
he
said
to
why
he
come
to
the
natasha
did
not
answer
her
tell
torture
natasha
no
one
ought
to
interfere
in
such
i
have
confided
in
why

to
the
asked
he
openly
ask
for
your
you
know
prince
andrew
gave
you
complete
it
is
really
but
i
believe
have
you
considered
what
these
secret
reasons
can
natasha
looked
at
sonya
with
evidently
this
question
presented
itself
to
her
mind
for
the
first
time
and
she
did
not
know
how
to
answer
know
what
the
reasons
but
there
must
be
sonya
sighed
and
shook
her
head
there
were
she
but
guessing
her
interrupted
her
in
one
doubt
one
one
you
she
he
love

love
natasha
repeated
with
a
smile
of
pity
at
her
lack
of
you
have
read
his
letter
and
you
have
seen
if
he
is
if
you
only
exclaimed
he
is
an
honorable
man
he
should
either
declare
his
intentions
or
cease
seeing
and
if
you
do
i
i
will
write
to
and
i
will
tell
said
sonya
i
live
without
cried
i
understand
and
what
are
you
think
of
your
father
and
of
want
i
love
anyone
but
how
dare
you
say
he
is
you
know
that
i
love
screamed
i
want
to
quarrel
with
but
for
sake
you
see
how
i
am
natasha
cried
in
a
voice
of
despair
and
repressed
sonya
burst
into
sobs
and
ran
from
the
natasha
went
to
the
table
and
without
a
reflection
wrote
that
answer
to
princess
mary
which
she
had
been
unable
to
write
all
the
in
this
letter
she
said
briefly
that
all
their
misunderstandings
were
at
an
that
availing
herself
of
the
magnanimity
of
prince
andrew
who
when
he
went
abroad
had
given
her
her
she
begged
princess
mary
to
forget
everything
and
forgive
her
if
she
had
been
to
blame
toward
but
that
she
could
not
be
his
at
that
moment
this
all
seemed
quite
and
clear
to
on
friday
the
rostovs
were
to
return
to
the
but
on
wednesday
the
count
went
with
the
prospective
purchaser
to
his
estate
near
on
the
day
the
count
sonya
and
natasha
were
invited
to
a
big
dinner
party
at
the
and
marya
dmitrievna
took
them
at
that
party
natasha
again
met
and
sonya
noticed
that
she
spoke
to
trying
not
to
be
and
that
all
through
dinner
she
was
more
agitated
than
when
they
got
home
natasha
was
the
first
to
begin
the
explanation
sonya
you
were
talking
all
sorts
of
nonsense
about
natasha
began
in
a
mild
voice
such
as
children
use
when
they
wish
to
be
have
had
an
explanation
what
what
did
he
how
glad
i
am
not
angry
with
tell
me
whole
what
did
he
natasha
became
if
you
knew
him
as
i
he
he
asked
me
what
i
had
promised
he
was
glad
i
was
free
to
refuse
sonya
sighed
you
refused
said
i
perhaps
all
is
over
between
me
and
why
do
you
think
so
badly
of
think
only
i
understand
a
understand
see
what
a
man
he
now
think
badly
of
me
or
of
i
think
badly
of
i
love
and
pity
but
what
am
i
to
sonya
did
not
succumb
to
the
tender
tone
natasha
used
toward
the
more
emotional
and
ingratiating
the
expression
of
face
the
more
serious
and
stern
grew
said
asked
me
not
to
speak
to
and
i
but
now
you
yourself
have
i
trust
why
this
interrupted
i
am
afraid
for
of
am
afraid
going
to
your
said
sonya
and
was
herself
horrified
at
what
she
had
anger
again
showed
in
go
to
my
i
as
soon
as
not
your
it
be
but
leave
me
leave
me
i
hate
moaned
hate
i
hate
my
enemy
and
natasha
ran
out
of
the
natasha
did
not
speak
to
sonya
again
and
avoided
with
the
same
expression
of
agitated
surprise
and
guilt
she
went
about
the
taking
up
now
one
now
and
at
once
abandoning
hard
as
it
was
for
she
watched
her
friend
and
did
not
let
her
out
of
her
the
day
before
the
count
was
to
sonya
noticed
that
natasha
sat
by
the
window
all
the
morning
as
if
expecting
something
and
that
she
made
a
sign
to
an
officer
who
drove
whom
sonya
took
to
be
sonya
began
watching
her
friend
still
more
attentively
and
noticed
that
at
dinner
and
all
that
evening
natasha
was
in
a
strange
and
unnatural
she
answered
questions
at
began
sentences
she
did
not
and
laughed
at
after
tea
sonya
noticed
a
housemaid
at
door
timidly
waiting
to
let
her
she
let
the
girl
go
and
then
listening
at
the
door
learned
that
another
letter
had
been
then
suddenly
it
became
clear
to
sonya
that
natasha
had
some
dreadful
plan
for
that
sonya
knocked
at
her
natasha
did
not
let
her
will
run
away
with
thought
is
capable
of
there
was
something
particularly
pathetic
and
resolute
in
her
face
she
cried
as
she
said
to
sonya
she
means
to
elope
with
but
what
am
i
to
thought
recalling
all
the
signs
that
clearly
indicated
that
natasha
had
some
terrible
count
is
what
am
i
to
write
to
kuragin
demanding
an
but
what
is
there
to
oblige
him
to
write
to
as
prince
andrew
asked
me
to
in
case
of
some
but
perhaps
she
really
has
already
refused
sent
a
letter
to

on
admonishing
her
for
some
enjoining
on
her
that
it

assuring
her
that

not

her
with

and
herself
brought
her
some

marya
dmitrievna
as
she
went
out
of

supposing
natasha
to
be
but
natasha
was
not
with
pale
face
and
fixed
eyes
she
looked
straight
before
all
that
night
she
did
not
sleep
or
weep
and
did
not
speak
to
sonya

got
up
and
went

as
he
had

was
in
very
good
the
affair
with
the
purchaser
was
going
on
and
there
was
nothing
to
keep
him
any
longer
in
away
from
the
countess
whom
he
marya
dmitrievna
met
him
and
told
him
that
natasha
had
been
very
unwell
the
day
before
and
that
they
had
sent
for
the
but
that
she
was
better
natasha
had
not
left
her
room
that
with
compressed
and
parched
lips
and
dry
fixed
she
sat
at
the
uneasily
watching
the
people
who
drove
past
and
hurriedly
glancing
round
at
anyone
who
entered
the
she
was
evidently
expecting
news
of
him
and
that
he
would
come
or
would
write
to
when
the
count
came
to
see
her
she
turned
anxiously
round
at
the
sound
of
a
and
then
her
face
resumed
its
cold
and
malevolent
she
did
not
even
get
up
to
greet

the
matter
with
my
are
you
asked
the
after
a
silence
natasha
in
reply
to
the
anxious
inquiries
as
to
why
she
was
so
dejected
and
whether
anything
had
happened
to
her
she
assured
him
that
nothing
had
happened
and
asked
him
not
to
marya
dmitrievna
confirmed
assurances
that
nothing
had
from
the
pretense
of
from
his
and
by
the
embarrassed
faces
of
sonya
and
marya
the
count
saw
clearly
that
something
had
gone
wrong
during
his
but
it
was
so
terrible
for
him
to
think
that
anything
disgraceful
had
happened
to
his
beloved
and
he
so
prized
his
own
cheerful
that
he
avoided
inquiries
and
tried
to
assure
himself
that
nothing
particularly
had
and
he
was
only
dissatisfied
that
her
indisposition
delayed
their
return
to
the
chapter
xix
from
the
day
his
wife
arrived
in
moscow
pierre
had
been
intending
to
go
away
so
as
not
to
be
near
soon
after
the
rostovs
came
to
moscow
the
effect
natasha
had
on
him
made
him
hasten
to
carry
out
his
he
went
to
tver
to
see
joseph
who
had
long
since
promised
to
hand
over
to
him
some
papers
of
her
deceased
when
he
returned
to
moscow
pierre
was
handed
a
letter
from
marya
dmitrievna
asking
him
to
come
and
see
her
on
a
matter
of
great
importance
relating
to
andrew
bolkonski
and
his
pierre
had
been
avoiding
natasha
because
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
feeling
for
her
was
stronger
than
a
married
should
be
for
his
yet
some
fate
constantly
threw
them
can
have
and
what
can
they
want
with
thought
he
as
he
dressed
to
go
to
marya
only
prince
andrew
would
hurry
up
and
come
and
marry
thought
he
on
his
way
to
the
on
the
tverskoy
boulevard
a
familiar
voice
called
to
been
back
someone
pierre
raised
his
in
a
sleigh
drawn
by
two
gray
that
were
bespattering
the
dashboard
with
anatole
and
his
constant
companion
makarin
dashed
anatole
was
sitting
upright
in
the
classic
pose
of
military
the
lower
part
of
his
face
hidden
by
his
beaver
collar
and
his
head
slightly
his
face
was
fresh
and
his
tilted
to
one
disclosed
his
curled
and
pomaded
hair
besprinkled
with
powdery
a
true
thought
sees
nothing
beyond
the
pleasure
of
the
nothing
troubles
him
and
so
he
is
always
and
what
i
give
to
be
like
he
thought
in
marya
anteroom
the
footman
who
helped
him
off
with
his
fur
coat
said
that
the
mistress
asked
him
to
come
to
her
when
he
opened
the
ballroom
door
pierre
saw
natasha
sitting
at
the
with
a
and
spiteful
she
glanced
round
at
and
left
the
room
with
an
expression
of
cold
has
asked
entering
marya
answered
years
have
i
lived
in
this
world
and
never
known
anything
so
and
having
put
him
on
his
honor
not
to
repeat
anything
she
told
marya
dmitrievna
informed
him
that
natasha
had
refused
prince
andrew
without
her
knowledge
and
that
the
cause
of
this
was
anatole
kuragin
into
whose
society
wife
had
thrown
her
and
with
whom
natasha
had
tried
to
elope
during
her
in
order
to
be
married
pierre
raised
his
shoulders
and
listened
to
what
was
told
scarcely
able
to
believe
his
own
that
prince
deeply
loved
affianced
same
natasha
rostova
who
used
to
be
so
give
up
bolkonski
for
that
fool
anatole
who
was
already
secretly
married
pierre
and
should
be
so
in
love
with
him
as
to
agree
to
run
away
with
was
something
pierre
could
not
conceive
and
could
not
he
could
not
reconcile
the
charming
impression
he
had
of
whom
he
had
known
from
a
with
this
new
conception
of
her
and
he
thought
of
his
are
all
he
said
to
reflecting
that
he
was
not
the
only
man
unfortunate
enough
to
be
tied
to
a
bad
but
still
he
pitied
prince
andrew
to
the
point
of
tears
and
sympathized
with
his
wounded
and
the
more
he
pitied
his
friend
the
more
did
he
think
with
contempt
and
even
with
disgust
of
that
natasha
who
had
just
passed
him
in
the
ballroom
with
such
a
look
of
cold
he
did
not
know
that
soul
was
overflowing
with
and
and
that
it
was
not
her
fault
that
her
face
happened
to
assume
an
expression
of
calm
dignity
and
how
get
said
in
answer
to
marya
could
not
is
get
worse
from
hour
to
ejaculated
marya
nice
what
a
and
expecting
him
since
she
must
be
then
at
least
she
go
on
expecting
after
hearing
the
details
of
marriage
from
and
giving
vent
to
her
anger
against
anatole
in
words
of
marya
dmitrievna
told
pierre
why
she
had
sent
for
she
was
afraid
that
the
count
or
who
might
arrive
at
any
if
they
knew
of
this
affair
she
hoped
to
hide
from
might
challenge
anatole
to
a
and
she
therefore
asked
pierre
to
tell
his
in
her
name
to
leave
moscow
and
not
dare
to
let
her
set
eyes
on
him
now
realizing
the
danger
to
the
old
and
prince
promised
to
do
as
she
having
briefly
and
exactly
explained
her
wishes
to
she
let
him
go
to
the
drawing

as
she
led
him
along
the
corridor
to
pale
and
was
sitting
beside
marya
and
her
glittering
met
pierre
with
a
questioning
look
the
moment
he
she
did
not
smile
or
but
only
gazed
fixedly
at
and
her
look
asked
only

dropping
his
eyes
with
a
feeling
of
pity
for
her
and
loathing
for
the
thing

pierre
did
not
stay
for
but
left
the
room
and
went
away
at
he
drove
through
the
town
seeking
anatole
at
the
thought
of
whom
now
the
blood
rushed
to
his
heart
and
he
felt
a
difficulty
in
he
was
not
at
the
ice
nor
at
the
nor
at
pierre
drove
to
the
in
the
club
all
was
going
on
as
the
members
who
were
assembling
for

were
sitting
about
in
they
greeted
pierre
and
spoke
of
the
town
the
footman
having
greeted
knowing
his
habits
and
his
told
him
there
was
a
place
left
for
him
in
the
small
dining
room
and
that

which
was
talked
of
in
the
and

laughed
and
said
it
was
nonsense
for
he
had
just
come
from
the
he
asked
everyone
about
one
man
told
him
he
had
not
come
and
another
that
he
was
coming
to
pierre
felt
it
strange
to
see
this
indifferent
crowd
of
people
unaware
of
what
was
going
on
in
his
he
paced
through
the
waited
till
everyone
had
and
as
anatole
had
not
turned
up
did
not
stay
for
dinner
but
drove
for

that
day
with
consulting
him
as
to
how
to
remedy
this
unfortunate
it
seemed
to
him
essential
to
see
in
the
evening
he
drove
to
his
to
discuss
with
her
how
to
arrange
a
when
pierre
returned
home
after
vainly
hunting
all
over
his
valet

him
that
prince

full
of
pierre
without
greeting
his
wife
whom
he
had
not
seen
since
his
at
that
moment
she
was
more
repulsive
to
him
than
the
drawing

seeing
anatole
went
up
to

the
countess
going
up
to
her
know
what
a
plight

glowing
eyes
and
his
resolute
the

indications
of
that
rage
and
strength
which
she
knew

herself
experienced
after
his

but
pierre
did
not

and
went
out
of
the

him
with
his
usual
jaunty
step
but
his
face
betrayed

closed

and
addressed
anatole
without

from

took
a

paperweight
and
lifted

back
in

to
a
frightened
gesture
of
the

short
again

and
again
pacing

continued
without

a
spark
of

the
room
several
times
in

at
a
table
frowning
and
biting

must
understand
that
besides
your
pleasure
there

such
a
thing
as

that

understand
that
it
is
as
mean
as
beating

and
looked
at

no
longer
with
an
angry
but
with
a
questioning

growing
more
confident
as
pierre
mastered
his

not
looking
at

with
a
slight
tremor
of
his
lower
you
have
used

so
as
a
man
of
honor

at
him
with
unable

at
the
loose
if

for
your
anatole
the
expression
of
that
base
and
cringing
which

and
heartless

the
night
after
she
had
been
told
that
anatole
was
with
some
arsenic
she
had
stealthily
after
swallowing
a
little
she
had
been
so
frightened
that
she
woke
sonya
and
told
her
what
she
had
the
necessary
antidotes
had
been
administered
in
time
and
she
was
now
out
of
though
still
so
weak
that
it
was
out
of
the
question
to
move
her
to
the
and
so
the
countess
had
been
sent
pierre
saw
the
distracted
and
who
had
a
but
he
could
not
see
pierre
dined
at
the
club
that
day
and
heard
on
all
sides
gossip
about
the
attempted
abduction
of
he
resolutely
denied
these
assuring
everyone
that
nothing
had
happened
except
that
his
law
had
proposed
to
her
and
been
it
seemed
to
pierre
that
it
was
his
duty
to
conceal
the
whole
affair
and
he
was
awaiting
prince
return
with
dread
and
went
every
day
to
the
old
for
news
of
old
prince
bolkonski
heard
all
the
rumors
current
in
the
town
from
mademoiselle
bourienne
and
had
read
the
note
to
princess
mary
in
which
natasha
had
broken
off
her
he
seemed
in
better
spirits
than
usual
and
awaited
his
son
with
great
some
days
after
departure
pierre
received
a
note
from
prince
informing
him
of
his
arrival
and
asking
him
to
come
to
see
as
soon
as
he
reached
prince
andrew
had
received
from
his
father
note
to
princess
mary
breaking
off
her
engagement
bourienne
had
purloined
it
from
princess
mary
and
given
it
to
the
old
and
he
heard
from
him
the
story
of
with
prince
andrew
had
arrived
in
the
evening
and
pierre
came
to
see
him
next
pierre
expected
to
find
prince
andrew
in
almost
the
same
state
as
natasha
and
was
therefore
surprised
on
entering
the
drawing
room
to
hear
him
in
the
study
talking
in
a
loud
animated
voice
about
some
intrigue
going
on
in
the
old
voice
and
another
now
and
then
interrupted
princess
mary
came
out
to
meet
she
looking
toward
the
door
of
the
room
where
prince
andrew
evidently
intending
to
express
her
sympathy
with
his
but
pierre
saw
by
her
face
that
she
was
glad
both
at
what
had
happened
and
at
the
way
her
brother
had
taken
the
news
of
says
he
expected
she
know
his
pride
will
not
let
him
express
his
but
still
he
has
taken
it
far
than
i
evidently
it
had
to
is
it
possible
that
all
is
really
asked
princess
mary
looked
at
him
with
she
did
not
understand
how
he
could
ask
such
a
pierre
went
into
the
prince
greatly
changed
and
plainly
in
better
but
with
a
fresh
horizontal
wrinkle
between
his
stood
in
civilian
dress
facing
his
father
and
prince
warmly
disputing
and
vigorously
the
conversation
was
about
news
of
whose
sudden
exile
and
alleged
treachery
had
just
reached
he
is
censured
and
accused
by
all
who
were
enthusiastic
about
him
a
month
prince
andrew
was
by
those
who
were
unable
to
understand
his
to
judge
a
man
who
is
in
disfavor
and
to
throw
on
him
all
the
blame
of
other
mistakes
is
very
but
i
maintain
that
if
anything
good
has
been
accomplished
in
this
reign
it
was
done
by
by
him
he
paused
at
the
sight
of
his
face
quivered
and
immediately
assumed
a
vindictive
will
do
him
he
and
at
once
turned
to
how
are
still
getting
he
said
with
but
the
new
wrinkle
on
his
forehead
i
am
he
said
in
answer
to
and
to
pierre
that
smile
said
am
but
my
health
is
now
of
no
use
to
after
a
few
words
to
pierre
about
the
awful
roads
from
the
polish
about
people
he
had
met
in
switzerland
who
knew
and
about
whom
he
had
brought
from
abroad
to
be
his
prince
andrew
again
joined
warmly
in
the
conversation
about
speranski
which
was
still
going
on
between
the
two
old
there
were
or
proofs
of
secret
relations
with
they
would
have
been
made
he
said
with
warmth
and
do
and
never
like
speranski
but
i
like
pierre
now
recognized
in
his
friend
a
need
with
which
he
was
only
too
to
get
excited
and
to
have
arguments
about
extraneous
matters
in
order
to
stifle
thoughts
that
were
too
oppressive
and
too
when
prince
meshcherski
had
prince
andrew
took
arm
and
asked
him
into
the
room
that
had
been
assigned
a
bed
had
been
made
up
and
some
open
portmanteaus
and
trunks
stood
prince
andrew
went
to
one
and
took
out
a
small
from
which
he
drew
a
packet
wrapped
in
he
did
it
all
silently
and
very
he
stood
up
and
his
face
was
gloomy
and
his
lips
me
for
troubling
pierre
saw
that
prince
andrew
was
going
to
speak
of
and
his
broad
face
expressed
pity
and
this
expression
irritated
prince
and
in
a
and
unpleasant
tone
he
have
received
a
refusal
from
countess
rostova
and
have
heard
reports
of
your
having
sought
her
or
something
of
that
is
that
true
and
pierre
but
prince
andrew
interrupted
are
her
letters
and
her
said
he
took
the
packet
from
the
table
and
handed
it
to
this
to
the
if
you
see
is
very
said
she
is
here
said
prince
prince
he
added
left
long
she
has
been
at
much
regret
her
said
prince
and
he
smiled
like
his
and
monsieur
kuragin
has
not
honored
countess
rostova
with
his
said
prince
and
he
snorted
several
could
not
for
he
was
married
said
prince
andrew
laughed
again
reminding
one
of
his
where
is
your
if
i
may
he
has
gone
to
but
i
said
it
said
prince
countess
rostova
that
she
was
and
is
perfectly
free
and
that
i
wish
her
all
that
is
pierre
took
the
prince
as
if
trying
to
remember
whether
he
had
something
more
to
or
waiting
to
see
if
pierre
would
say
looked
fixedly
at
do
you
remember
our
discussion
in
asked
returned
prince
andrew
said
that
a
fallen
woman
should
be
but
i
say
i
could
forgive
i
can
this
be
said
prince
andrew
interrupted
him
and
cried
ask
her
hand
be
and
so
that
would
be
very
but
i
am
unable
to
follow
in
that
if
you
wish
to
be
my
friend
never
speak
to
me
of
of
all
so
give
her
the
pierre
left
the
room
and
went
to
the
old
prince
and
princess
the
old
man
seemed
livelier
than
princess
mary
was
the
same
as
but
beneath
her
sympathy
for
her
pierre
noticed
her
satisfaction
that
the
engagement
had
been
broken
looking
at
them
pierre
realized
what
contempt
and
animosity
they
all
felt
for
the
and
that
it
was
impossible
in
their
presence
even
to
mention
the
name
of
her
who
could
give
up
prince
andrew
for
anyone
at
dinner
the
talk
turned
on
the
the
approach
of
which
was
becoming
prince
andrew
talked
arguing
now
with
his
now
with
the
swiss
tutor
and
showing
an
unnatural
the
cause
of
which

that
same
evening
pierre
went
to
the
to
fulfill
the
commission
entrusted
to
natasha
was
in
the
count
at
the
and
after
giving
the
letters
to
went
to
marya
dmitrievna
who
was
interested
to
know
how
prince
andrew
had
taken
the
ten
minutes
later
sonya
came
to
marya
insists
on
seeing
count
peter
said
are
we
to
take
him
up
to
the
room
there
has
not
been
tidied
she
has
dressed
and
gone
into
the
drawing
said
marya
dmitrievna
only
shrugged
her
will
her
mother
she
has
worried
me
to
now
tell
her
said
she
to
the
heart
to
scold
she
is
so
much
to
be
so
much
to
be
natasha
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
drawing
with
a
pale
set
but
not
at
all
shamefaced
as
pierre
expected
to
find
when
he
appeared
at
the
door
she
grew
evidently
undecided
whether
to
go
to
meet
him
or
to
wait
till
he
came
pierre
hastened
to
he
thought
she
would
give
him
her
hand
as
but
stepping
up
to
breathing
her
arms
hanging
lifelessly
just
in
the
pose
she
used
to
stand
in
when
she
went
to
the
middle
of
the
ballroom
to
but
with
quite
a
different
expression
of
she
began
bolkonski
was
your
your
she
corrected
seemed
to
her
that
everything
that
had
once
been
must
now
be
told
me
once
to
apply
to
pierre
sniffed
as
he
looked
at
but
did
not
till
then
he
had
reproached
her
in
his
heart
and
tried
to
despise
but
he
now
felt
so
sorry
for
her
that
there
was
no
room
in
his
soul
for
is
here
tell
to
forgive
she
stopped
and
breathed
still
more
but
did
not
shed
i
will
tell
answered
he
did
not
know
what
to
natasha
was
evidently
dismayed
at
the
thought
of
what
he
might
think
she
had
i
know
all
is
she
said
that
can
never
only
tormented
by
the
wrong
i
have
done
tell
him
only
that
i
beg
him
to
forgive
me
for
she
trembled
all
over
and
sat
down
on
a
a
sense
of
pity
he
had
never
before
known
overflowed
will
tell
i
will
tell
him
everything
once
said
i
should
like
to
know
one
eyes
should
like
to
did
you
pierre
did
not
know
how
to
refer
to
anatole
and
flushed
at
the
thought
of
you
love
that
bad
call
him
said
i
know
at
she
began
to
cry
and
a
still
greater
sense
of
and
love
welled
up
in
he
felt
the
tears
trickle
under
his
spectacles
and
hoped
they
would
not
be
speak
of
it
any
my
said
and
his
cordial
tone
suddenly
seemed
very
strange
to
speak
of
my
tell
him
but
one
thing
i
beg
of
consider
me
your
friend
and
if
you
want
or
simply
to
open
your
heart
to
but
when
your
mind
is
clearer
think
of
he
took
her
hand
and
kissed
shall
be
happy
if
in
my
pierre
grew
speak
to
me
like
i
am
not
worth
exclaimed
natasha
and
turned
to
leave
the
but
pierre
held
her
he
knew
he
had
something
more
to
say
to
but
when
he
said
it
he
was
amazed
at
his
own
you
have
your
whole
life
before
said
he
to
all
is
over
for
she
replied
with
shame
and
he
i
were
not
but
the
and
best
man
in
the
and
were
i
would
this
moment
ask
on
my
knees
for
your
hand
and
your
for
the
first
time
for
many
days
natasha
wept
tears
of
gratitude
and
and
glancing
at
pierre
she
went
out
of
the
pierre
too
when
she
had
gone
almost
ran
into
the
restraining
tears
of
tenderness
and
joy
that
choked
and
without
finding
the
sleeves
of
his
fur
cloak
threw
it
on
and
got
into
his
to
your
asked
the
pierre
asked
can
i
go
surely
not
to
the
club
or
to
pay
all
men
seemed
so
so
in
comparison
with
this
feeling
of
tenderness
and
love
he
in
comparison
with
that
last
look
she
had
given
him
through
her
said
and
despite
degrees
of
frost
fahrenheit
he
threw
open
the
bearskin
cloak
from
his
broad
chest
and
inhaled
the
air
with
it
was
clear
and
above
the
above
the
black
stretched
the
dark
starry
only
looking
up
at
the
sky
did
pierre
cease
to
feel
how
sordid
and
humiliating
were
all
mundane
things
compared
with
the
heights
to
which
his
soul
had
just
been
at
the
entrance
to
the
arbat
square
an
immense
expanse
of
dark
starry
sky
presented
itself
to
his
almost
in
the
center
of
above
the
prechistenka
surrounded
and
sprinkled
on
all
sides
by
stars
but
distinguished
from
them
all
by
its
nearness
to
the
its
white
and
its
long
uplifted
shone
the
enormous
and
brilliant
comet
of
comet
which
was
said
to
portend
all
kinds
of
woes
and
the
end
of
the
in
that
comet
with
its
long
luminous
tail
aroused
no
feeling
of
on
the
contrary
he
gazed
his
eyes
moist
with
at
this
bright
comet
having
traveled
in
its
orbit
with
inconceivable
velocity
through
immeasurable
seemed
an
arrow
piercing
the
remain
fixed
in
a
chosen
vigorously
holding
its
tail
shining
and
displaying
its
white
light
amid
countless
other
scintillating
it
seemed
to
pierre
that
this
comet
fully
responded
to
what
was
passing
in
his
own
softened
and
uplifted
now
blossoming
into
a
new
book
1812
chapter
i
from
the
close
of
the
year
1811
intensified
arming
and
concentrating
of
the
forces
of
western

and
in
1812
these

reckoning
those
transporting
and
feeding

the
west

to
the

which
since
1811
russian
forces
had
been
similarly
on
the
twelfth
of
the
forces
of
western
europe
crossed
the
russian
frontier
and
war
that
an
event
took
place
opposed
to
human
reason
and
to
human
millions
of
men
perpetrated
against
one
another
such
innumerable
issues
of
false
and
murders
as
in
whole
centuries
are
not
recorded
in
the
annals
of
all
the
law
courts
of
the
but
which
those
who
committed
them
did
not
at
the
time
regard
as
being
what
produced
this
extraordinary
what
were
its
the
historians
tell
us
with
naive
assurance
that
its
causes
were
the
wrongs
inflicted
on
the
duke
of
the
nonobservance
of
the
continental
the
ambition
of
the
firmness
of
the
mistakes
of
the
and
so
it
would
only
have
been
necessary
for
or
between
a
levee
and
an
evening
to
have
taken
proper
pains
and
written
a
more
adroit
or
for
napoleon
to
have
written
to
respected
i
consent
to
restore
the
duchy
to
the
duke
of
there
would
have
been
no
we
can
understand
that
the
matter
seemed
like
that
to
it
naturally
seemed
to
napoleon
that
the
war
was
caused
by
intrigues
in
fact
he
said
on
the
island
of
it
naturally
seemed
to
members
of
the
english
parliament
that
the
cause
of
the
war
was
to
the
duke
of
that
the
cause
of
the
war
was
the
violence
done
to
to
businessmen
that
the
cause
of
the
war
was
the
continental
system
which
was
ruining
to
the
generals
and
old
soldiers
that
the
chief
reason
for
the
war
was
the
necessity
of
giving
them
to
the
legitimists
of
that
day
that
it
was
the
need
of
les
bons
and
to
the
diplomatists
of
that
time
that
it
all
resulted
from
the
fact
that
the
alliance
between
russia
and
austria
in
1809
had
not
been
sufficiently
well
concealed
from
and
from
the
awkward
wording
of
memorandum
it
is
natural
that
these
and
a
countless
and
infinite
quantity
of
other
the
number
depending
on
the
endless
diversity
of
points
of
presented
themselves
to
the
men
of
that
but
to
to
posterity
who
view
the
thing
that
happened
in
all
its
magnitude
and
perceive
its
plain
and
terrible
these
causes
seem
to
us
it
is
incomprehensible
that
millions
of
christian
men
killed
and
tortured
each
other
either
because
napoleon
was
ambitious
or
alexander
was
or
because
policy
was
astute
or
the
duke
of
oldenburg
we
cannot
grasp
what
connection
such
circumstances
have
with
the
actual
fact
of
slaughter
and
why
because
the
duke
was
thousands
of
men
from
the
other
side
of
europe
killed
and
ruined
the
people
of
smolensk
and
moscow
and
were
killed
by
to
their
who
are
not
historians
and
are
not
carried
away
by
the
process
of
research
and
can
therefore
regard
the
event
with
unclouded
common
an
incalculable
number
of
causes
present
the
deeper
we
delve
in
search
of
these
causes
the
more
of
them
we
and
each
separate
cause
or
whole
series
of
causes
appears
to
us
equally
valid
in
itself
and
equally
false
by
its
insignificance
compared
to
the
magnitude
of
the
and
by
its
from
the
cooperation
of
all
the
other
coincident
occasion
the
to
the
wish
or
objection
of
this
or
that
french
corporal
to
serve
a
second
term
appears
as
much
a
cause
as
refusal
to
withdraw
his
troops
beyond
the
vistula
and
to
restore
the
duchy
of
for
had
he
not
wished
to
and
had
a
a
and
a
thousandth
corporal
and
private
also
there
would
have
been
so
many
less
men
in
army
and
the
war
could
not
have
had
napoleon
not
taken
offense
at
the
demand
that
he
should
withdraw
beyond
the
and
not
ordered
his
troops
to
there
would
have
been
no
but
had
all
his
sergeants
objected
to
serving
a
second
term
then
also
there
could
have
been
no
nor
could
there
have
been
a
war
had
there
been
no
english
intrigues
and
no
duke
of
and
had
alexander
not
felt
and
had
there
not
been
an
autocratic
government
in
or
a
revolution
in
france
and
a
subsequent
dictatorship
and
or
all
the
things
that
produced
the
french
and
so
without
each
of
these
causes
nothing
could
have
so
all
these
of
to
bring
it
and
so
there
was
no
one
cause
for
that
but
it
had
to
occur
because
it
had
millions
of
renouncing
their
human
feelings
and
had
to
go
from
west
to
east
to
slay
their
just
as
some
centuries
previously
hordes
of
men
had
come
from
the
east
to
the
slaying
their
the
actions
of
napoleon
and
on
whose
words
the
event
seemed
to
were
as
little
voluntary
as
the
actions
of
any
soldier
who
was
drawn
into
the
campaign
by
lot
or
by
this
could
not
be
for
in
order
that
the
will
of
napoleon
and
alexander
whom
the
event
seemed
to
should
be
carried
the
concurrence
of
innumerable
circumstances
was
needed
without
any
one
of
which
the
event
could
not
have
taken
it
was
necessary
that
millions
of
men
in
whose
hands
lay
the
real
soldiers
who
or
transported
provisions
and
consent
to
carry
out
the
will
of
these
weak
and
should
have
been
induced
to
do
so
by
an
infinite
number
of
diverse
and
complex
we
are
forced
to
fall
back
on
fatalism
as
an
explanation
of
irrational
events
is
to
events
the
reasonableness
of
which
we
do
not
the
more
we
try
to
explain
such
events
in
history
the
more
unreasonable
and
incomprehensible
do
they
become
to
each
man
lives
for
using
his
freedom
to
attain
his
personal
and
feels
with
his
whole
being
that
he
can
now
do
or
abstain
from
doing
this
or
that
but
as
soon
as
he
has
done
that
action
performed
at
a
certain
moment
in
time
becomes
irrevocable
and
belongs
to
in
which
it
has
not
a

a

there
are
two
sides
to
the
life
of
every

individual
which
is
the
more

the
more
abstract

his
elemental

in
which
he
inevitably
obeys

down

unconscious
instrument

every
act

which
appears
to
them
an
act

in

ii

the
diplomatists
still
firmly
believed
in
the
possibility
of

and
worked
zealously
to
that
and
though
the
emperor
napoleon
himself
wrote
a
letter
to
calling
him

sincerely
assured
him
that
he

at
each
of
these
towns
thousands
of
people
met
him
with
excitement

the
army
was
moving
from
west
to

relays
of
six
horses
carried
him
in
the

up

out

standing
apart
from

suite
in

of
his

of

was
one
common
expression
of
joy
at
the
commencement
of
the
campaign
and
of
rapture
and
devotion
to
the
man
in
the
gray
coat
who
was
standing
on
the
on
the
thirteenth
of
june
a
rather
thoroughbred
arab
horse
was
brought
to

mounted
it
and
rode
at
a
gallop
to
one
of
the
bridges
over
the

by
incessant
and
rapturous
acclamations
which
he
evidently
endured
only
because
it
was
impossible
to
forbid
the
soldiers
to
express
their
love
of
him
by
such
but
the
shouting
which
accompanied
him
everywhere
disturbed
him
and
distracted
him
from
the
military
cares
that
had
occupied
him
from
the
time
he
joined

rode
across

of

down

sat
down
on

lay
on

mute
sign
from
a
telescope
was
handed
him
which
he
rested
on
the
back
of
a
happy
page
who
had
run
up
to

he
gazed
at
the
opposite
then
he
became
absorbed
in
a
map
laid
out
on
the
without
lifting
his
head
he
said
and
two
of
his
galloped
off
to
the
polish

was
heard
in
the
ranks
of
the
polish
uhlans

one
of

the
whether

gave
an

to
his
which

grown

plunged
into

of

uncanny

hold
of

they
fell
off

some
of

some
of

sat
on

up

pacing
up

down

giving

occasionally
glancing
disapprovingly
at

distracted

was
no

back

some
of

got
across

with
difficulty
clambered
out
on

as
soon
as
they
had
got
in

and
streaming

shouted
and
looked
ecstatically
at
the
spot
where
napoleon

where

no

up
to
him

contrary
to
court
etiquette
stood
near
him
while
he
was
talking
to
a
polish
having
finished
speaking
to
the
emperor
looked
inquiringly
at
balashev
evidently
understanding
that
he
only
acted
thus
because
there
were
important
reasons
for
so
nodded
slightly
to
the
lady
and
turned
to
hardly
had
balashev
begun
to
speak
before
a
look
of
amazement
appeared
on
the
he
took
balashev
by
the
arm
and
crossed
the
room
with
unconsciously
clearing
a
path
seven
yards
wide
as
the
people
on
both
sides
made
way
for
boris
noticed
excited
face
when
the
sovereign
went
out
with
arakcheev
looked
at
the
emperor
from
under
his
brow
sniffing
with
his
red
stepped
forward
from
the
crowd
as
if
expecting
the
emperor
to
address
understood
that
arakcheev
envied
balashev
and
was
displeased
that
evidently
important
news
had
reached
the
emperor
otherwise
than
through
but
the
emperor
and
balashev
passed
out
into
the
illuminated
garden
without
noticing
arakcheev
holding
his
sword
and
glancing
wrathfully
followed
some
twenty
paces
behind
all
the
time
boris
was
going
through
the
figures
of
the
he
was
worried
by
the
question
of
what
news
balashev
had
brought
and
how
he
could
find
it
out
before
in
the
figure
in
which
he
had
to
choose
two
he
whispered
to
helene
that
he
meant
to
choose
countess
potocka
he
had
gone
out
onto
the
and
glided
over
the
parquet
to
the
door
opening
into
the
seeing
balashev
and
the
emperor
returning
to
the
he
stood
they
were
moving
toward
the
fluttering
as
if
he
had
not
had
time
to
respectfully
pressed
close
to
the
doorpost
with
bowed

the
agitation
of
one
who
has
been

finishing
with
these

without
declaring
i
will
not
make
peace
as
long
as
a
single
armed
enemy
remains
in
my
it
seemed
to
boris
that
it
gave
the
emperor
pleasure
to
utter
these
he
was
satisfied
with
the
form
in
which
he
had
expressed
his
but
displeased
that
boris
had
overheard
no

know
of

added
with

that
this
was
meant
for

closing

remained
there
about

boris
was
thus
the
first
to
learn
the
news
that
the
french
army
had
crossed
the
niemen
thanks
to
was
able
to
show
certain
important
personages
that
much
that
was
concealed
from
others
was
usually
known
to
and
by
this
means
he
rose
higher
in
their
the
unexpected
news
of
the
french
having
crossed
the
niemen
was
particularly
startling
after
a
month
of
unfulfilled
and
at
a
on
first
receiving
the
under
the
influence
of
indignation
and
resentment
the
emperor
had
found
a
phrase
that
pleased
fully
expressed
his
and
has
since
become
on
returning
home
at
two
that
night
he
sent
for
his
and
told
him
to
write
an
order
to
the
troops
and
a
rescript
to
field
marshal
prince
in
which
he
insisted
on
the
words
being
inserted
that
he
would
not
make
peace
so
long
as
a
single
armed
frenchman
remained
on
russian
next
day
the
following
letter
was
sent
to
monsieur

yesterday
i
learned
despite
the
loyalty
with
which
i
have
kept
my
engagements
with
your
your
troops
have
crossed
the
russian
and
i
have
this
moment
received
from
petersburg
a
in
which
count
lauriston
informs
as
a
reason
for
this
that
your
majesty
has
considered
yourself
to
be
in
a
state
of
war
with
me
from
the
time
prince
kuragin
asked
for
his
the
reasons
on
which
the
duc
de
bassano
based
his
refusal
to
deliver
them
to
him
would
never
have
led
me
to
suppose
that
that
could
serve
as
a
pretext
for
in
the
as
he
himself
has
was
never
authorized
to
make
that
and
as
soon
as
i
was
informed
of
it
i
let
him
know
how
much
i
disapproved
of
it
and
ordered
him
to
remain
at
his
if
your
majesty
does
not
intend
to
shed
the
blood
of
our
peoples
for
such
a
and
consents
to
withdraw
your
troops
from
russian
i
will
regard
what
has
passed
as
not
having
occurred
and
an
understanding
between
us
will
be
in
the
contrary
your
i
shall
see
myself
forced
to
repel
an
attack
that
nothing
on
my
part
has
it
still

on
your

preserve
humanity
from
the

him
to
take
it
and
hand
it
personally
to
the
french
when
dispatching
the
emperor
repeated
to
him
the
words
that
he
would
not
make
peace
so
long
as
a
single
armed
enemy
remained
on
russian
soil
and
told
him
to
transmit
those
words
to
alexander
did
not
insert
them
in
his
letter
to
because
with
his
characteristic
tact
he
felt
it
would
be
injudicious
to
use
them
at
a
moment
when
a
last
attempt
at
reconciliation
was
being
but
he
definitely
instructed
balashev
to
repeat
them
personally
to
having
set
off
in
the
small
hours
of
the
accompanied
by
a
bugler

not

balashev
mentioned
who

the
noncommissioned

talking
with
his
comrades
about
regimental
matters
without
looking
at
the
russian
after
living
at
the
seat
of
the
highest
authority
and
after
conversing
with
the
emperor
less
than
three
hours
and
in
general
being
accustomed
to
the
respect
due
to
his
rank
in
the
balashev
found
it
very
strange
here
on
russian
soil
to
encounter
this
and
still
more
this
application
of
brute
force
to
the
sun
was
only
just
appearing
from
behind

fresh

a
herd
of
cattle

over

larks
rose
one
after

bubbles

looked
around
awaiting
the
arrival
of
an
officer

just
left

riding
from
the
village
on
a
handsome
sleek
gray
accompanied
by
two
the
the
and
their
horses
all
looked
smart
and
well
it
was
that
first
period
of
a
campaign
when
troops
are
still
in
full
almost
like
that
of
peacetime
but
with
a
shade
of
martial
swagger
in
their
and
a
touch
of
the
gaiety
and
spirit
of
enterprise
which
always
accompany
the
opening
of
a
the
french
colonel
with
difficulty
repressed
a
but
was
polite
and
evidently
understood
he
led
him
past
his
soldiers
and
behind
the
outposts
and
told
him
that
his
wish
to
be
presented
to
the
emperor
would
most
likely
be
satisfied

the
quarters

not

rode
through

sentinels

men
who
saluted
their

stared
with
curiosity
at

came
out
at
the
other
end
of

the
colonel
said
that
the
commander
of

division

a
mile
and
a
quarter
away
and
would
receive
balashev
and
conduct
him
to

sun
had
by
now
risen
and
shone
gaily
on
the
bright
they
had
hardly
ridden
up
a
past
a
before
they
saw
a
group
of
horsemen
coming
toward
in
front
of
the
on
a
black
horse
with
trappings
that
glittered
in
the
rode
a
tall
man
with
plumes
in
his
hat

black
hair
curling
down
to

wore
a

and
stretched
his
long
legs
forward

man
rode
toward

at
a

and
his
gems
and
gold

glittering
in

bright
june
balashev
was
only
two
length
from
the
equestrian
with
the
and
gold
who
was
galloping
toward
him
with
a
theatrically
solemn
when
the
french
whispered
king
of
it
in
now
called
of
though
it
was
quite
incomprehensible
why
he
should
be
king
of
he
was
called
and
was
himself
convinced
that
he
was
and
therefore
assumed
a
more
solemn
and
important
air
than
he
was
so
sure
that
he
really
was
the
king
of
naples
that
on
the
eve
of
his
departure
from
that
while
walking
through
the
streets
with
his
some
italians
called
out
to
il
he
turned
to
his
wife
with
a
pensive
smile
and
they
know
that
i
am
leaving
them
live
the
but
though
he
firmly
believed
himself
to
be
king
of
naples
and
pitied
the
grief
felt
by
the
subjects
he
was
after
he
had
been
ordered
to
return
to
military
especially
since
his
last
interview
with
napoleon
in
when
his
august
had
told
made
you
king
that
you
should
reign
in
my

not

cheerfully
taken
up
his
familiar

but
not
overfat
horse
that
feels
himself
in
harness
and
grows
skittish
between
the
dressed
up
in
clothes
as
variegated
and
expensive
as
and
gaily
and
contentedly
galloped
along
the
roads
of
without
himself
knowing
why
or
on
seeing
the
russian
general
he
threw
back
his
with
its
long
hair
curling
to
his
in
a
majestically
royal
and
looked
inquiringly
at
the
french
the
colonel
respectfully
informed
his
majesty
of
whose
name
he
could
not
said
the
king
by
his
assurance
the
difficulty
that
had
presented
itself
to
the
to
make
your
he
with
a
gesture
of
kingly
as
soon
as
the
king
began
to
speak
loud
and
fast
his
royal
dignity
instantly
forsook
and
without
noticing
it
he
passed
into
his
natural
tone
of
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
withers
of
horse
and
it
all
looks
like
as
if
regretting
a
circumstance
of
which
he
was
unable
to
replied
the
does
not
desire
war
and
as
your
majesty
said
using
the
words
your
majesty
at
every
with
the
affectation
unavoidable
in
frequently
addressing
one
to
whom
the
title
was
still
a
face
beamed
with
stupid
satisfaction
as
he
listened
to
de
but
royaute
and
he
felt
it
incumbent
on
as
a
king
and
an
to
confer
on
state
affairs
with
he
took
and
moving
a
few
steps
away
from
his
which
waited
began
to
pace
up
and
down
with
trying
to
speak
he
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
emperor
napoleon
had
resented
the
demand
that
he
should
withdraw
his
troops
from
especially
when
that
demand
became
generally
known
and
the
dignity
of
france
was
thereby
has
its
balashev
replied
that
there
was
offensive
in
the
but
murat
interrupted
you
consider
the
emperor
alexander
the
he
asked
with
a
kindly
and
foolish
balashev
told
him
why
he
considered
napoleon
to
be
the
originator
of
the
my
dear
murat
again
interrupted
all
my
heart
i
wish
the
emperors
may
arrange
the
affair
between
and
that
the
war
begun
by
no
wish
of
mine
may
finish
as
quickly
as
said
in
the
tone
of
a
servant
who
wants
to
remain
good
friends
with
another
despite
a
quarrel
between
their
and
he
went
on
to
inquiries
about
the
grand
duke
and
the
state
of
his
and
to
reminiscences
of
the
gay
and
amusing
times
he
had
spent
with
him
in
then
as
if
remembering
his
royal
murat
solemnly
drew

the
pose
in

with
his
embroidered
red

flowing
and
his
glittering

rejoined

suite
who
were
respectfully
awaiting

supposing
from
words
that
he
would
very
soon
be
brought
before
napoleon
but
instead
of
at
the
next

sentinels
of

to

what
arakcheev
was
to
not
a
coward
like
he
was
as
as
and
as
unable
to
express
his
devotion
to
his
monarch
except
by
in
the

such

incongruous
their

this
inevitability

can
explain
how
the
cruel
who
tore
out
a

with
his

whose
weak
nerves
rendered
him
unable
to

who

shed
of
a

auditing
better
quarters
could
have
been
found
but
marshal
davout
was
one
of
those
men
who
purposely
put
themselves
in
most
depressing
conditions
to
have
a
justification
for
being
for
the
same
reason
they
are
always
hard
at
work
and
in

i
think
of
the
bright
side
of
life
as
you
i
am
sitting
on
a
barrel
and
working
in
a
dirty
the
expression
of
his
face
seemed
to
the
chief
pleasure
and
necessity
of
such
when
they
encounter
anyone
who
shows

to
flaunt
their
own
persistent
davout
allowed
himself
that
pleasure
when
balashev
was
brought
he
became
still
more
absorbed
in
his
task
when
the
russian
general
and
after
glancing
over
his
spectacles
at
which
was
animated
by
the
beauty
of
the
morning
and
by
his
talk
with

did
not
rise
or
even
but
scowled
still
more
and
sneered
when
he
noticed
in
face
the
disagreeable
impression
this
reception
davout
raised
his
head
and
coldly
asked
what
he
thinking
he
could
have
been
received
in
such
a
manner
only
because
davout
did
not
know
that
he
was
adjutant
general
to
the
emperor
alexander
and
even
his
envoy
to
balashev
hastened
to
inform
him
of
his
rank

contrary

hearing
became
still
surlier

an

to
call

took
out
the

by

so
lately

day
the

to

informed
him
of

of
the
preobrazhensk
regiment

stood
in

of
the
house
to

balashev
was

now
two
french
grenadiers
stood
there
in
blue
uniforms
unfastened
in
front
and
with
shaggy
caps
on
their
and
an
escort
of
hussars
and
uhlans
and
a
brilliant
suite
of
and
who
were
waiting
for
napoleon
to
come
were
standing
at
the
round
his
saddle

and
his
napoleon
received
balashev
in
the
very
house
in
vilna
from
which
alexander
had
dispatched
him
on
his
chapter
vi
though
balashev
was
used
to
imperial
he
was
amazed
at
the
luxury
and
magnificence
of
the
comte
de
turenne
showed
him
into
a
big
reception
room
where
many
and
polish
of
whom
balashev
had
seen
at
the
court
of
the
emperor
of
duroc
said
that
napoleon
would
receive
the
russian
general
before
going
for
his
after
some
the
who
was
on
duty
came
into
the
great
reception
room
bowing
asked
balashev
to
follow
balashev
went
into
a
small
reception
one
door
of
which
led
into
a
the
very
one
from
which
the
russian
emperor
had
dispatched
him
on
his
he
stood
a
minute
or
he
heard
hurried
footsteps
beyond
the
both
halves
of
it
were
opened
all
was
silent
and
then
from
the
study
the
sound
was
heard
of
other
firm
and
were
those
of
he
had
just
finished
dressing
for
his
and
wore
a
blue
opening
in
front
over
a
white
waistcoat
so
long
that
it
covered
his
rotund
white
leather
breeches
tightly
fitting
the
fat
thighs
of
his
short
and
hessian
his
short
hair
had
evidently
just
been
but
one
lock
hung
down
in
the
middle
of
his
broad
his
plump
white
neck
stood
out
sharply
above
the
black
collar
of
his
and
he
smelled
of
eau
de
his
full
rather
with
its
prominent
wore
a
gracious
and
majestic
expression
of
imperial
he
entered
with
a
jerk
at
every
step
and
his
head
slightly
thrown
his
whole
short
corpulent
figure
with
broad
thick
and
chest
and
stomach
involuntarily
had
that
imposing
and
stately
appearance
one
sees
in
men
of
forty
who
live
in
it
was
that
he
was
in
the
best
of
spirits
that
he
nodded
in
answer
to
low
and
respectful
and
coming
up
to
him
at
once
began
speaking
like
a
man
who
values
every
moment
of
his
time
and
does
not
condescend
to
prepare
what
he
has
to
say
but
is
sure
he
will
always
say
the
right
thing
and
say
it
said
have
received
the
letter
you
brought
from
the
emperor
alexander
and
am
very
glad
to
see
he
glanced
with
his
large
eyes
into
face
and
immediately
looked
past
it
was
plain
that
personality
did
not
interest
him
at
evidently
only
what
took
place
within
his
own
mind
interested
nothing
outside
himself
had
any
significance
for
because
everything
in
the
it
seemed
to
depended
entirely
on
his
do
and
did
desire
he
it
has
been
forced
on
even
emphasized
the
am
ready
to
receive
any
explanations
you
can
give
and
he
began
clearly
and
concisely
to
explain
his
reasons
for
dissatisfaction
with
the
russian
judging
by
the
calmly
moderate
and
amicable
tone
in
which
the
french
emperor
balashev
was
firmly
persuaded
that
he
wished
for
peace
and
intended
to
enter
into
when
having
finished
looked
inquiringly
at
the
russian
balashev
began
a
speech
he
had
prepared
long
the
my
but
the
sight
of
the
eyes
bent
on
him
confused
are
napoleon
seemed
to
as
with
a
scarcely
perceptible
smile
he
looked
at
uniform
and
balashev
recovered
himself
and
began
to
he
said
that
the
emperor
alexander
did
not
consider
demand
for
his
passports
a
sufficient
cause
for
that
kurakin
had
acted
on
his
own
initiative
and
without
his
that
the
emperor
alexander
did
not
desire
and
had
no
relations
with
interposed
as
if
fearing
to
give
vent
to
his
he
frowned
and
nodded
slightly
as
a
sign
that
balashev
might
after
saying
all
he
had
been
instructed
to
balashev
added
that
the
emperor
alexander
wished
for
but
would
not
enter
into
negotiations
except
on
condition
here
balashev
he
remembered
the
words
the
emperor
alexander
had
not
written
in
his
but
had
specially
inserted
in
the
rescript
to
saltykov
and
had
told
balashev
to
repeat
to
balashev
remembered
these
long
as
a
single
armed
foe
remains
on
russian
but
some
complex
feeling
restrained
he
could
not
utter
though
he
wished
to
do
he
grew
confused
and
condition
that
the
french
army
retires
beyond
the
napoleon
noticed
embarrassment
when
uttering
these
last
his
face
twitched
and
the
calf
of
his
left
leg
began
to
quiver
without
moving
from
where
he
stood
he
began
speaking
in
a
louder
tone
and
more
hurriedly
than
during
the
speech
that
who
more
than
once
lowered
his
involuntarily
noticed
the
quivering
of
left
leg
which
increased
the
more
napoleon
raised
his
desire
no
less
than
the
emperor
he
i
not
for
eighteen
months
been
doing
everything
to
obtain
i
have
waited
eighteen
months
for
but
in
order
to
begin
what
is
demanded
of
he
frowning
and
making
an
energetic
gesture
of
inquiry
with
his
small
white
plump
withdrawal
of
your
army
beyond
the
replied
repeated
now
you
want
me
to
retire
beyond
the
the
repeated
looking
straight
at
the
latter
bowed
his
head
instead
of
the
demand
of
four
months
earlier
to
withdraw
from
only
a
withdrawal
beyond
the
niemen
was
now
napoleon
turned
quickly
and
began
to
pace
the
say
the
demand
now
is
that
i
am
to
withdraw
beyond
the
niemen
before
commencing
but
in
just
the
same
way
two
months
ago
the
demand
was
that
i
should
withdraw
beyond
the
vistula
and
the
and
yet
you
are
willing
to
he
went
in
silence
from
one
corner
of
the
room
to
the
other
and
again
stopped
in
front
of
balashev
noticed
that
his
left
leg
was
quivering
faster
than
before
and
his
face
seemed
petrified
in
its
stern
this
quivering
of
his
left
leg
was
a
thing
napoleon
was
conscious
vibration
of
my
left
calf
is
a
great
sign
with
he
remarked
at
a
later
demands
as
to
retreat
beyond
the
vistula
and
oder
may
be
made
to
a
prince
of
but
not
to
napoleon
almost
quite
to
his
own
you
gave
me
petersburg
and
moscow
i
could
not
accept
such
you
say
i
have
begun
this
but
who
first
joined
his
the
emperor
not
and
you
offer
me
negotiations
when
i
have
expended
when
you
are
in
alliance
with
and
when
your
position
is
a
bad
you
offer
me
but
what
is
the
aim
of
your
alliance
with
what
has
she
given
he
continued
evidently
no
longer
trying
to
show
the
advantages
of
peace
and
discuss
its
but
only
to
prove
his
own
rectitude
and
power
and
errors
and
the
commencement
of
his
speech
had
obviously
been
made
with
the
intention
of
demonstrating
the
advantages
of
his
position
and
showing
that
he
was
nevertheless
willing
to
but
he
had
begun
and
the
more
he
talked
the
less
could
he
control
his
the
whole
purport
of
his
remarks
now
was
evidently
to
exalt
himself
and
insult
what
he
had
least
desired
at
the
commencement
of
the
hear
you
have
made
peace
with
balashev
bowed
his
head
has
been
he
but
napoleon
did
not
let
him
he
evidently
wanted
to
do
all
the
talking
and
continued
to
talk
with
the
sort
of
eloquence
and
unrestrained
irritability
to
which
spoiled
people
are
so
i
know
you
have
made
peace
with
the
turks
without
obtaining
moldavia
and
i
would
have
given
your
sovereign
those
provinces
as
i
gave
him
he
went
promised
and
would
have
given
the
emperor
alexander
moldavia
and
and
now
he
have
those
splendid
yet
he
might
have
united
them
to
his
empire
and
in
a
single
reign
would
have
extended
russia
from
the
gulf
of
bothnia
to
the
mouths
of
the
catherine

great
could
not
have
done

growing
more
and
more
excited
as
he
paced
up
and
down
the
repeating
to
balashev
almost
the
very
words
he
had
used
to
alexander
himself
at
he
would
have
owed
to
my
what
a
splendid

repeated
several
then
drew
from
his
pocket
a
gold
lifted
it
to
his
and
greedily
sniffed
at
a
splendid
reign

emperor

have

looked
compassionately
at
and
as
soon
as
the
latter
tried
to
make
some
rejoinder

interrupted

that

walked
silently
several
times
up

down

put
his

it
out
lifted
it
several
times

stopped
in

ironically
straight
into

said
in
a
quiet
yet
what
a
splendid
reign
your
master
might
have
feeling
it
incumbent
on
him
to
said
that
from
the
russian
side
things
did
not
appear
in
so
gloomy
a
napoleon
was
still
looking
derisively
at
him

evidently
not
listening
to
balashev
said
that
in

best
results
were

as
if
to

your

quickly
to
the
everyone
in
the
reception
room
rushed
forward
and
descended
the
chapter
vii
after
all
that
napoleon
had
said
to
bursts
of
anger

the
last
dryly
spoken

detain
you
no

balashev
felt
convinced
that
napoleon
would
not
wish
to
see
and
would
even
avoid
another
meeting
with
insulted
as
he
had
witnessed
his
unseemly
to
his
balashev
through
an
invitation
to
dine
with
the
emperor
that
and
berthier
were
present
at
that
napoleon
met
balashev
cheerfully
and
he
not
only
showed
no
sign
of
constraint
or
on
account
of
his
outburst
that
on
the
tried
to
reassure
it
was
evident
that
he
had
long
been
convinced
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
make
a
and
that
in
his
perception
whatever
he
did
was
not
because
it
harmonized
with
any
idea
of
right
and
but
because
he
did
the
emperor
was
in
very
good
spirits
after
his
ride
through
where
crowds
of
people
had
rapturously
greeted
and
followed
from
all
the
windows
of
the
streets
through
which
he
and
his
monogram
were
and
the
polish
welcoming
waved
their
handkerchiefs
to
at
having
placed
balashev
beside
napoleon
not
only
treated
him
amiably
but
behaved
as
if
balashev
were
one
of
his
own
one
of
those
who
sympathized
with
his
plans
and
ought
to
rejoice
at
his
in
the
course
of
conversation
he
mentioned
moscow
and
questioned
balashev
about
the
russian
not
merely
as
an
interested
traveler
asks
about
a
new
city
he
intends
to
but
as
if
convinced
that
as
a
must
be
flattered
by
his
many
inhabitants
are
there
in
how
many
is
it
true
that
moscow
is
called
how
many
churches
are
there
in
he
and
receiving
the
reply
that
there
were
more
than
two
hundred
he
such
a
quantity
of
russians
are
very
replied
a
large
number
of
monasteries
and
churches
is
always
a
sign
of
the
backwardness
of
a
said
turning
to
caulaincourt
for
appreciation
of
this
balashev
respectfully
ventured
to
disagree
with
the

its
own
said
nowhere
in
europe
is
there
anything
like
said
beg
your
returned
russia
there
is
where
there
are
also
many
churches
and
this
reply
of
which
hinted
at
the
recent
defeats
of
the
french
in
was
much
appreciated
when
he
related
it
at
but
it
was
not
much
appreciated
at
where
it
passed
the
uninterested
and
perplexed
faces
of
the
marshals
showed
that
they
were
puzzled
as
to
what
tone
there
is
a
point
we
see
or
it
is
not
at
all
their
expressions
seemed
to
so
little
was
his
rejoinder
appreciated
that
napoleon
did
not
notice
it
at
all
and
naively
asked
balashev
through
what
towns
the
direct
road
from
there
to
moscow
who
was
on
the
alert
all
through
the
replied
that
just
as
roads
lead
to
so
all
roads
lead
to
there
were
many
and
them
the
road
through
which
charles
xii
balashev
involuntarily
flushed
with
pleasure
at
the
aptitude
of
this
but
hardly
had
he
uttered
the
word
poltava
before
caulaincourt
began
speaking
of
the
badness
of
the
road
from
petersburg
to
moscow
and
of
his
petersburg
after
dinner
they
went
to
drink
coffee
in
which
four
days
previously
had
been
that
of
the
emperor
napoleon
sat
toying
with
his
sevres
coffee
and
motioned
balashev
to
a
chair
beside
napoleon
was
in
that
mood
more
than
any
reasoned
makes
a
man
contented
with
himself
and
disposed
to
consider
everyone
his
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
surrounded
by
men
who
adored
and
he
felt
convinced
after
his
balashev
too
was
his
friend
and
napoleon
turned
to
him
with
a
though
slightly
tell
me
this
is
the
room
the
emperor
alexander
he
evidently
not
doubting
that
this
remark
would
be
agreeable
to
his
hearer
since
it
went
to
prove
superiority
to
balashev
made
no
reply
and
bowed
his
head
in
four
days
ago
in
this
wintzingerode
and
stein
were
continued
napoleon
with
the
same
derisive
and
confident
i
he
went
that
the
emperor
alexander
has
surrounded
himself
with
my
personal
that
i
do
has
he
not
thought
that
i
may
do
the
and
he
turned
inquiringly
to
and
evidently
this
thought
turned
him
back
on
to
the
track
of
his
which
was
still
fresh
in
let
him
know
that
i
will
do
said
rising
and
pushing
his
cup
away
with
his
drive
all
his
and
weimar
relations
out
of
drive
them
let
him
prepare
an
asylum
for
them
in
balashev
bowed
his
head
with
an
air
indicating
that
he
would
like
to
make
his
bow
and
and
only
listened
because
he
could
not
help
hearing
what
was
said
to
napoleon
did
not
notice
this
he
treated
balashev
not
as
an
envoy
from
his
but
as
a
man
now
fully
devoted
to
him
and
who
must
rejoice
at
his
former
why
has
the
emperor
alexander
taken
command
of
the
what
is
the
good
of
war
is
my
but
his
business
is
to
reign
and
not
to
command
why
has
he
taken
on
himself
such
a
again
napoleon
brought
out
his
paced
several
times
up
and
down
the
room
in
and
suddenly
and
went
up
to
balashev
and
with
a
slight
as
and
simply
as
if
he
were
doing
something
not
merely
important
but
pleasing
to
he
raised
his
hand
to
the
russian
face
taking
him
by
the
pulled
it
smiling
with
his
lips
to
have
ear
pulled
by
the
emperor
was
considered
the
greatest
honor
and
mark
of
favor
at
the
french
adorer
and
courtier
of
the
emperor
why
you
say
said
as
if
it
was
in
his
to
be
the
adorer
and
courtier
of
anyone
but
the
horses
ready
for
the
he
with
a
slight
inclination
of
his
head
in
reply
to
him
have
he
has
a
long
way
to
the
letter
taken
by
balashev
was
the
last
napoleon
sent
to
every
detail
of
the
interview
was
communicated
to
the
russian
and
the
war
chapter
viii
after
his
interview
with
pierre
in
prince
andrew
went
to
on
business
as
he
told
his
but
really
to
meet
anatole
kuragin
whom
he
felt
it
necessary
to
on
reaching
petersburg
he
inquired
for
kuragin
but
the
latter
had
already
left
the
pierre
had
warned
his
that
prince
andrew
was
on
his
anatole
kuragin
promptly
obtained
an
appointment
from
the
minister
of
war
and
went
to
join
the
army
in
while
in
petersburg
prince
andrew
met
his
former
commander
who
was
always
well
disposed
toward
and
kutuzov
suggested
that
he
should
accompany
him
to
the
army
in
to
which
the
old
general
had
been
appointed
so
prince
having
received
an
appointment
on
the
headquarters
left
for
prince
andrew
did
not
think
it
proper
to
write
and
challenge
he
thought
that
if
he
challenged
him
without
some
fresh
cause
it
might
compromise
the
young
countess
rostova
and
so
he
wanted
to
meet
kuragin
personally
in
order
to
find
a
fresh
pretext
for
a
but
he
again
failed
to
meet
kuragin
in
for
soon
after
prince
andrew
the
latter
returned
to
in
a
new
amid
new
prince
andrew
found
life
easier
to
after
his
betrothed
had
broken
faith
with
he
felt
the
more
acutely
the
more
he
tried
to
conceal
its
surroundings
in
which
he
had
been
happy
became
trying
to
and
the
freedom
and
independence
he
had
once
prized
so
highly
were
still
more
not
only
could
he
no
longer
think
the
thoughts
that
had
first
come
to
him
as
he
lay
gazing
at
the
sky
on
the
field
of
austerlitz
and
had
later
enlarged
upon
with
and
which
had
filled
his
solitude
at
bogucharovo
and
then
in
switzerland
and
but
he
even
dreaded
to
recall
them
and
the
bright
and
boundless
horizons
they
had
he
was
now
concerned
only
with
the
nearest
practical
matters
unrelated
to
his
past
and
he
seized
on
these
the
more
eagerly
the
more
those
past
interests
were
closed
to
it
was
as
if
that
infinite
canopy
of
heaven
that
had
once
towered
above
him
had
suddenly
turned
into
a
solid
vault
that
weighed
him
in
which
all
was
but
nothing
eternal
or
of
the
activities
that
presented
themselves
to
army
service
was
the
simplest
and
most
as
a
general
on
duty
on
he
applied
himself
to
business
with
zeal
and
perseverance
and
surprised
kutuzov
by
his
willingness
and
accuracy
in
not
having
found
kuragin
in
prince
andrew
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
rush
back
to
russia
after
but
all
the
same
he
knew
that
however
long
it
might
be
before
he
met
despite
his
contempt
for
him
and
despite
all
the
proofs
he
deduced
to
convince
himself
that
it
was
not
worth
stooping
to
a
conflict
with
knew
that
when
he
did
meet
him
he
would
not
be
able
to
resist
calling
him
any
more
than
a
ravenous
man
can
help
snatching
at
and
the
consciousness
that
the
insult
was
not
yet
that
his
rancor
was
still
weighed
on
his
heart
and
poisoned
the
artificial
tranquillity
which
he
managed
to
obtain
in
turkey
by
means
of
and
rather
vainglorious
and
ambitious
in
the
year
when
news
of
the
war
with
napoleon
reached
where
kutuzov
had
been
living
for
two
passing
his
days
and
nights
with
a
wallachian
andrew
asked
kutuzov
to
transfer
him
to
the
western
who
was
already
weary
of
activity
which
seemed
to
reproach
his
own
very
readily
let
him
go
and
gave
him
a
mission
to
barclay
de
before
joining
the
western
army
which
was
in
encamped
at
prince
andrew
visited
bald
hills
which
was
directly
on
his
being
only
two
miles
off
the
smolensk
during
the
last
three
years
there
had
been
so
many
changes
in
his
he
had
and
seen
so
much
traveled
both
in
the
east
and
the
that
on
reaching
bald
hills
it
struck
him
as
strange
and
unexpected
to
find
the
way
of
life
there
unchanged
and
still
the
same
in
every
he
entered
through
the
gates
with
their
stone
pillars
and
drove
up
the
avenue
leading
to
the
house
as
if
he
were
entering
an
sleeping
the
same
old
the
same
the
same
stillness
reigned
and
inside
there
was
the
same
the
same
and
and
the
same
timid
only
somewhat
princess
mary
was
still
the
same
plain
maiden
getting
on
in
uselessly
and
joylessly
passing
the
best
years
of
her
life
in
fear
and
constant
mademoiselle
bourienne
was
the
same
enjoying
every
moment
of
her
existence
and
full
of
joyous
hopes
for
the
she
had
merely
become
more
prince
andrew
the
tutor
he
had
brought
from
was
wearing
a
coat
of
russian
cut
and
talking
broken
russian
to
the
but
was
still
the
same
narrowly
and
pedantic
the
old
prince
had
changed
in
appearance
only
by
the
loss
of
a
which
left
a
noticeable
gap
on
one
side
of
his
in
character
he
was
the
same
as
only
showing
still
more
irritability
and
skepticism
as
to
what
was
happening
in
the
little
nicholas
alone
had
he
had
become
had
curly
dark
when
merry
and
quite
unconsciously
lifted
the
upper
lip
of
his
pretty
little
mouth
just
as
the
little
princess
used
to
he
alone
did
not
obey
the
law
of
immutability
in
the
sleeping
but
though
externally
all
remained
as
of
the
inner
relations
of
all
these
people
had
changed
since
prince
andrew
had
seen
them
the
household
was
divided
into
two
alien
and
hostile
who
changed
their
habits
for
his
sake
and
only
met
because
he
was
to
the
one
camp
belonged
the
old
mademoiselle
and
the
to
the
other
princess
little
and
all
the
old
nurses
and
during
his
stay
at
bald
hills
all
the
family
dined
but
they
were
ill
at
ease
and
prince
andrew
felt
that
he
was
a
visitor
for
whose
sake
an
exception
was
being
made
and
that
his
presence
made
them
all
feel
involuntarily
feeling
this
at
dinner
on
the
first
he
was
and
the
old
prince
noticing
this
also
became
morosely
dumb
and
retired
to
his
apartments
directly
after
in
the
when
prince
andrew
went
to
him
trying
to
rouse
began
to
tell
him
of
the
young
count
the
old
prince
began
unexpectedly
to
talk
about
princess
blaming
her
for
her
superstitions
and
her
dislike
of
mademoiselle
he
was
the
only
person
really
attached
to
the
old
prince
said
that
if
he
was
ill
it
was
only
because
of
princess
that
she
purposely
worried
and
irritated
and
that
by
indulgence
and
silly
talk
she
was
spoiling
little
prince
the
old
prince
knew
very
well
that
he
tormented
his
daughter
and
that
her
life
was
very
but
he
also
knew
that
he
could
not
help
tormenting
her
and
that
she
deserved
does
prince
who
sees
say
nothing
to
me
about
his
does
he
think
me
a
or
an
old
fool
without
any
keeps
his
own
daughter
at
a
distance
and
attaches
this
frenchwoman
to
he
so
i
must
explain
and
he
must
hear
me
thought
the
old
and
he
began
explaining
why
he
could
not
put
up
with
his
unreasonable
you
ask
said
prince
without
looking
up
was
censuring
his
father
for
the
first
time
in
his
did
not
wish
to
speak
about
but
as
you
ask
me
i
will
give
you
my
frank
if
there
is
any
misunderstanding
and
discord
between
you
and
i
blame
her
for
it
at
i
know
how
she
loves
and
respects
since
you
ask
continued
prince
becoming
he
was
always
liable
to
do
of
can
only
say
that
if
there
are
any
misunderstandings
they
are
caused
by
that
worthless
who
is
not
fit
to
be
my
the
old
man
at
first
stared
fixedly
at
his
and
an
unnatural
smile
disclosed
the
fresh
gap
between
his
teeth
to
which
prince
andrew
could
not
get
my
dear
already
been
talking
it
i
did
not
want
to
said
prince
in
a
hard
and
bitter
you
challenged
and
i
have
and
always
shall
that
mary
is
not
to
but
those
to
one
to
that
he
has
passed
passed
said
the
old
man
in
a
low
voice
as
it
seemed
to
prince
with
some
but
then
he
suddenly
jumped
up
and
be
let
not
a
trace
of
you
remain
prince
andrew
wished
to
leave
at
but
princess
mary
persuaded
him
to
stay
another
that
day
he
did
not
see
his
who
did
not
leave
his
room
and
admitted
no
one
but
mademoiselle
bourienne
and
but
asked
several
times
whether
his
son
had
next
before
prince
andrew
went
to
his
the
headed
like
his
mother
and
glowing
with
sat
on
his
and
prince
andrew
began
telling
him
the
story
of
but
fell
into
a
reverie
without
finishing
the
he
thought
not
of
this
pretty
his
son
whom
he
held
on
his
but
of
he
sought
in
himself
either
remorse
for
having
angered
his
father
or
regret
at
leaving
home
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
on
bad
terms
with
and
was
horrified
to
find
what
meant
still
more
to
him
was
that
he
sought
and
did
not
find
in
himself
the
former
tenderness
for
his
son
which
he
had
hoped
to
reawaken
by
caressing
the
boy
and
taking
him
on
his
go
said
his
prince
without
put
him
down
from
his
knee
and
went
out
of
the
as
soon
as
prince
andrew
had
given
up
his
daily
and
especially
on
returning
to
the
old
conditions
of
life
amid
which
he
had
been
weariness
of
life
overcame
him
with
its
former
and
he
hastened
to
escape
from
these
memories
and
to
find
some
work
as
soon
as
decided
to
asked
his
god
that
i
replied
prince
am
very
sorry
you
do
you
say
replied
princess
do
you
say
when
you
are
going
to
this
terrible
and
he
is
so
mademoiselle
bourienne
says
he
has
been
asking
about
as
soon
as
she
began
to
speak
of
her
lips
trembled
and
her
tears
began
to
prince
andrew
turned
away
and
began
pacing
the
my
my
when
one
thinks
who
and
cause
people
he
said
with
a
malignity
that
alarmed
princess
she
understood
that
when
speaking
of
he
referred
not
only
to
mademoiselle
the
cause
of
her
but
also
to
the
man
who
had
ruined
his
own
one
thing
i
i
entreat
of
she
touching
his
elbow
and
looking
at
him
with
eyes
that
shone
through
her
understand
looked
imagine
that
sorrow
is
the
work
of
men
are
his
she
looked
a
little
above
prince
head
with
the
accustomed
look
with
which
one
looks
at
the
place
where
a
familiar
portrait
is
sent
by
not
by
men
are
his
they
are
not
to
if
you
think
someone
has
wronged
forget
it
and
we
have
no
right
to
and
then
you
will
know
the
happiness
of
i
were
a
woman
i
would
do
that
is
a
but
a
man
should
not
and
cannot
forgive
and
he
and
though
till
that
moment
he
had
not
been
thinking
of
all
his
unexpended
anger
suddenly
swelled
up
in
his
mary
is
already
persuading
me
to
it
means
that
i
ought
long
ago
to
have
punished
he
and
giving
her
no
further
he
began
thinking
of
the
glad
vindictive
moment
when
he
would
meet
kuragin
who
he
knew
was
now
in
the
princess
mary
begged
him
to
stay
one
day
saying
that
she
knew
how
unhappy
her
father
would
be
if
andrew
left
without
being
reconciled
to
but
prince
andrew
replied
that
he
would
probably
soon
be
back
again
from
the
army
and
would
certainly
write
to
his
but
that
the
longer
he
stayed
now
the
more
embittered
their
differences
would
remember
that
misfortunes
come
from
and
men
are
never
to
were
the
last
words
he
heard
from
his
sister
when
he
took
leave
of
it
must
be
thought
prince
andrew
as
he
drove
out
of
the
avenue
from
the
house
at
bald
poor
innocent
is
left
to
be
victimized
by
an
old
man
who
has
outlived
his
the
old
man
feels
he
is
but
cannot
change
my
boy
is
growing
up
and
rejoices
in
in
which
like
everybody
else
he
will
deceive
or
be
and
i
am
off
to
the
i
myself
i
want
to
meet
that
man
whom
i
so
as
to
give
him
a
chance
to
kill
and
laugh
at

everyone
was
dissatisfied
with
the

course
of
affairs
in

but
no
one
anticipated
any
danger
of
invasion
of

and
no

thought
the

would
extend
farther
than
the
the
prince
andrew
found
barclay

to
whom
he
had
been
on
the
bank
of

as
there
was
not
a
single
town
or
large
village
in
the
vicinity
of

the
immense
number
of
generals
and
courtiers
accompanying
the

living

three
miles
from

he
received
bolkonski
stiffly
and
coldly
and
told
him
in
his
foreign
accent
that
he
would
mention
him
to
the
emperor
for
a
decision
as
to
his
but
asked
him
meanwhile
to
remain
on
his
anatole
whom
prince
andrew
had
hoped
to
find
with
the
was
not
he
had
gone
to
but
prince
andrew
was
glad
to
hear
his
mind
was
occupied
by
the
interests
of
the
center
that
was
conducting
a
gigantic
and
he
was
glad
to
be
free
for
a
while
from
the
distraction
caused
by
the
thought
of
during
the
first
four
while
no
duties
were
required
of
prince
andrew
rode
round
the
whole
fortified
camp
by
the
aid
of
his
own
knowledge
and
by
talks
with
tried
to
form
a
definite
opinion
about
but
the
question
whether
the
camp
was
advantageous
or
disadvantageous
remained
for
him
already
from
his
military
experience
and
what
he
had
seen
in
the
austrian
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
in
war
the
most
deeply
considered
plans
have
no
significance
and
that
all
depends
on
the
way
unexpected
movements
of
the
cannot
be
and
on
how
and
by
whom
the
whole
matter
is
to
clear
up
this
last
point
for
prince
utilizing
his
position
and
tried
to
fathom
the
character
of
the
control
of
the
army
and
of
the
men
and
parties
engaged
in
and
he
deduced
for
himself
the
following
of
the
state
of
while
the
emperor
had
still
been
at
the
forces
had
been
divided
into
three
the
army

barclay
de
the

and
the
one
commanded
by
the
emperor
was
with
the
first
but
not
as
in
the
orders
issued
it
was
not
that
the
emperor
would
take
but
only
that
he
would
be

the

him

of

a
point

many
secondary
personages
accompanying

because
their
principals
were
among
the
opinions
and
voices
in
this
and
proud
prince
andrew
noticed
the
following
sharply
defined
subdivisions
of
tendencies
and
the
first
party
consisted
of
pfuel
and
his
theorists
who
believed
in
a
science
of
war
with
immutable
of
oblique
and
so
pfuel
and
his
adherents
demanded
a
retirement
into
the
depths
of
the
country
in
accordance
with
precise
laws
defined
by
a
of
and
they
saw
only
or
evil
intention
in
every
deviation
from
that
to
this
party
belonged
the
foreign
and
chiefly
the
second
party
was
directly
opposed
to
the
one
as
always
was
met
by
representatives
of
the
the
members
of
this
party
were
those
who
had
demanded
an
advance
from
vilna
into
poland
and
freedom
from
all
prearranged
besides
being
advocates
of
bold

section
also
represented
which
made
them
still
more
in
the
they
were
ermolov
was
beginning
to
come
to
the
and
at
that
time
a
famous
joke
of
was
being
that
as
a
great
favor
he
had
petitioned
the
emperor
to
make
him
a
the
men
of
that
remembering
said
that
what
one
had
to
do
was
not
to
or
stick
pins
into
but
to
beat
the
keep
him
out
of
and
not
let
the
army
get
to
the
third
which
the
emperor
had
most
the
courtiers
who
tried
to
arrange
compromises
between
the
other
the
members
of
this
chiefly
civilians
and
to
whom
arakcheev
thought
and
said
what
men
who
have
no
convictions
but
wish
to
seem
to
have
some
generally
they
said
that
undoubtedly
particularly
against
such
a
genius
as
bonaparte
called
him
bonaparte
needs
most
deeply
devised
plans
and
profound
scientific
knowledge
and
in
that
respect
pfuel
was
a
but
at
the
same
time
it
had
to
be
acknowledged
that
the
theorists
are
often
and
therefore
one
should
not
trust
them
but
should
also
listen
to
what
opponents
and
practical
men
of
experience
in
warfare
had
to
and
then
choose
a
middle
they
insisted
on
the
retention
of
the
camp
at
according
to
but
on
changing
the
movements
of
the
other
by
this
neither
one
aim
nor
the
other
could
be
yet
it
seemed
best
to
the
adherents
of
this
third
of
a
fourth
opinion
the
most
conspicuous
representative
was
the
who
could
not
forget
his
disillusionment
at
where
he
had
ridden
out
at
the
head
of
the
in
his
casque
and
cavalry
uniform
as
to
a
expecting
to
crush
the
french
but
unexpectedly
finding
himself
in
the
front
line
had
narrowly
escaped
amid
the
general
the
men
of
this
party
had
both
the
quality
and
the
defect
of
frankness
in
their
they
feared
recognized
his
strength
and
their
own
and
frankly
said
they
but
and
ruin
will
come
of
all
we
have
abandoned
vilna
and
vitebsk
and
shall
abandon
the
only
reasonable
thing
left
to
do
is
to
conclude
peace
as
soon
as
before
we
are
turned
out
of
this
view

very
general
in
the
upper

circles
and
found
support
also
in
petersburg

in

fifth
party
consisted
of
those
who
were
adherents
of
barclay
de
not
so
much
as
a
man
but
as
minister
of
war
and
he
what
he
always
began
like
is
an
practical
man
and
we
have
nobody
give
him
real
for
war
cannot
be
conducted
successfully
without
unity
of
and
he
will
show
what
he
can
as
he
did
in
if
our
army
is
well
organized
and
strong
and
has
withdrawn
to
drissa
without
suffering
any
we
owe
this
entirely
to
if
barclay
is
now
to
be
superseded
by
bennigsen
all
will
be
for
bennigsen
showed
his
incapacity
already
in
the
sixth

that
at

rate
there
was
no
one
more
active

experienced
than
twist
about
as
you
you
will
have
to
come
to
bennigsen

the
others
make
mistakes

that
our
retirement
to
drissa
was
a
most
shameful
reverse
and
an
unbroken
series
of
more
mistakes
that
are
made
the
it
will
at
any
rate
be
understood
all
the
sooner
that
things
cannot
go
on
like
what
is
wanted
is
not
some
barclay
or
but
a
man
like
who
made
his
mark
in
and
to
whom
napoleon
himself
did
man
whose
authority
would
be
willingly
and
bennigsen
is
the
only
such
the
seventh
party
consisted
of
the
sort
of
people
who
are
always
to
be
especially
around
young
and
of
whom
there
were
particularly
many

devoted
to
the

as
a
monarch

as
a

him
sincerely

rostov

done
in

saw
in
him
not
only
all
the
virtues
but
all
human
capabilities
as
these
though
enchanted
with
the
sovereign
for
refusing
the
command
of
the

blamed
him
for
such
excessive

only
desired

insisted
that
their
adored
sovereign
should
abandon
his
diffidence

openly
announce
that
he
would
place
himself
at
the
head
of
the

theoreticians

practical
men

enormous

nor

advantage

attract
the
attention
by
loudly
advocating
the
very
thing
the
emperor
had
hinted
at

day

would
dispute
and
shout
at
the
beating

breast
and

gratuity

falsity

emerging
opinion

for
this
object

arguments

all
the
men
of
this
party
were
fishing
for
and
and
in
this
pursuit
watched
only
the
weathercock
of
imperial
and
directly
they
noticed
it
turning
in
any
this
whole
drone
population
of
the
army
began
blowing
hard
that
so
that
it
was
all
the
harder
for
the
emperor
to
turn
it
amid
the
uncertainties
of
the
with
the
menace
of
serious
danger
giving
a
peculiarly
threatening
character
to
amid
this
vortex
of
conflict
of
views
and
and
the
diversity
of
race
among
these
eighth
and
largest
party
of
those
preoccupied
with
personal
interests
imparted
great
confusion
and
obscurity

the
common
whatever

a
swarm
of
these
without
having
finished
their
buzzing

a
previous

over
to
the
new
one
and
by
their
hum
drowned
and
obscured
the
voices
of
those
who
were
disputing

all

at
the
time
prince
andrew
reached
the

being
formed

was
beginning
to

the
party

reasonable
men

capable

sharing
any
of
those
conflicting
were
able
to
take
a
detached
view
of
what
was
going
on
at
the
staff
at
headquarters
and
to
consider
means
of
escape
from
this
and
the
men
of
this
party
said
and
thought
that
what
was
wrong
resulted
chiefly
from
the
presence
in
the
army
with
his
military
court
and
from
the
consequent
presence
there
of
an
and
unsteady
fluctuation
of
which
is
in
place
at
court
but
harmful
in
an
that
a
sovereign
should
reign
but
not
command
the
and
that
the
only
way
out
of
the
position
would
be
for
the
emperor
and
his
court
to
leave
the
that
the
mere
presence
of
the
emperor
paralyzed
the
action
of
fifty
thousand
men
required
to
secure
his
personal
and
that
the
worst
if
would
be
better
than
the
very
best
one

by
the
presence
and
authority
of
the
just
at
the
time
prince
andrew
was
living
unoccupied
at
the
secretary
of
state
and
one
of
the
chief
representatives
of
this
wrote
a
letter
to
the
emperor
which
arakcheev
and
balashev
agreed
to
in
this
availing
himself
of
permission
given
him
by
the
emperor
to
discuss
the
general
course
of

respectfully
the
plea
that
it
was
necessary
for
the
sovereign
to
arouse
a
warlike
spirit
in
the
people
of
the

emperor
should
leave
the
that
arousing
of
the
people
by
their
sovereign
and
his
call
to
them
to
defend
their
very
incitement

was
the
chief
cause
of
triumph

it

the
sound
of
voices
conversing
in
german
and
occasionally
in
in
that
drawing
room
were
by
the
not
a
military
council
emperor
preferred
but
certain
persons
whose
opinions
he
wished
to
know
in
view
of
the
impending
it
was
not
a

of
as
it
a
council
to
elucidate
certain
questions
for
the
emperor
to
this
semicouncil
had
been
invited
the
swedish
general
adjutant
general
wintzingerode
napoleon
had
referred
to
as
a
renegade
french
count
stein
who
was
not
a
military
man
at
and
pfuel
as
prince
andrew
had
was
the
mainspring
of
the
whole

andrew

an
opportunity
of
getting
a
good
look
at
for
pfuel
arrived
soon
after
himself
in
passing
through
to
the
drawing
stopped
a
minute
to
speak
to
at
first
in
his
uniform
of
a
russian
which
fitted
him
badly
like
a
fancy
seemed
familiar
to
prince
though
he
saw
him
now
for
the
first
there
was
about
him
something
of
and
and
many
other
german
whom
prince
andrew
had
seen
in
but
he
was
more
typical
than
any
of
prince
andrew
had
never
yet
seen
a
german
theorist
in
whom
all
the
characteristics
of
those
others
were
united
to
such
an
pfuel
was
short
and
very
thin
but
of
robust
broad
in
the
and
with
prominent
shoulder
his
face
was
much
wrinkled
and
his
eyes
deep
his
hair
had
evidently
been
hastily
brushed
smooth
in
front
of
the
but
stuck
up
behind
in
quaint
little
he
entered
the
looking
restlessly
and
angrily
as
if
afraid
of
everything
in
that
large
awkwardly
holding
up
his
he
addressed
chernyshev
and
asked
in
german
where
the
emperor
one
could
see
that
he
wished
to
pass
through
the
rooms
as
quickly
as
finish
with
the
bows
and
and
sit
down
to
business
in
front
of
a
where
he
would
feel
at
he
nodded
hurriedly
in
reply
to
and
smiled
ironically
on
hearing
that
the
sovereign
was
inspecting
the
fortifications
that
had
planned
in
accord
with
his
he
muttered
something
to
himself
abruptly
and
in
a
bass
as
germans
might
have
been
or
whole
affair
will
be
or
absurd
will
come
of
prince
andrew
did
not
catch
what
he
said
and
would
have
passed
but
chernyshev
introduced
him
to
remarking
that
prince
andrew
was
just
back
from
turkey
where
the
war
had
terminated
so
pfuel
barely
so
much
at
prince
andrew
as
past
with
a
must
have
been
a
fine
tactical
laughing
went
on
into
the
room
from
which
the
sound
of
voices
was
always
inclined
to
be
irritably
was
particularly
disturbed
that
evidently
by
the
fact
that
they
had
dared
to
inspect
and
criticize
his
camp
in
his
from
this
short
interview
with
prince
thanks
to
his
austerlitz
was
able
to
form
a
clear
conception
of
the
pfuel
was
one
of
those
hopelessly
and
immutably
to
the
point
of
martyrdom
as
only
germans
because
only
germans
are
on
the
basis
of
an
abstract
that
the
supposed
knowledge
of
absolute
a
frenchman
is
because
he
regards
himself
both
in
mind
and
as
irresistibly
attractive
to
men
and
an
englishman
is
as
being
a
citizen
of
the
state
in
the
and
therefore
as
an
englishman
always
knows
what
he
should
do
and
knows
that
all
he
does
as
an
englishman
is
undoubtedly
an
italian
is
because
he
is
excitable
and
easily
forgets
himself
and
other
a
russian
is
just
because
he
knows
nothing
and
does
not
want
to
know
since
he
does
not
believe
that
anything
can
be
the
is
worst
of
stronger
and
more
repulsive
than
any
because
he
imagines
that
he
knows
the
which
he
himself
has
invented
but
which
is
for
him
the
absolute
pfuel
was
evidently
of
that
he
had
a
theory
of
oblique
movements
deduced
by
him
from
the
history
of
frederick
the
and
all
he
came
across
in
the
history
of
more
recent
warfare
seemed
to
him
absurd
and
collisions
in
which
so
many
blunders
were
committed
by
both
sides
that
these
wars
could
not
be
called
they
did
not
accord
with
the

therefore
could
not
serve
as
material
for

1806
pfuel

been
one
of
those
for
the
plan
of
campaign
that
ended
in
jena
and
but
he
did
not
see
the
least
proof
of
the
fallibility
of
his
theory
in
the
disasters
of
that
on
the
the
deviations
made
from
his
theory
in
his
the
sole
cause
of
the
whole

with
characteristically
gleeful
sarcasm
he
would

said
the
whole
affair
would
go
to

was
one
of
those
theoreticians
who
so
love
their
theory
that
they
lose
sight
of
the
practical
his
love
of
theory
made
him
hate
everything
and
he
would
not
listen
to
he
was
even
pleased
by
for
failures
resulting
from
deviations
in
practice
from
the
theory
only
proved
to
him
the
accuracy
of
his
he
said
a
few
words
to
prince
andrew
and
chernyshev
about
the
present
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
knows
beforehand
that
all
will
go
and
who
is
not
displeased
that
it
should
be
the
unbrushed
tufts
of
hair
sticking
up
behind

the
hastily
brushed
hair
on
his
temples
expressed
this
most

passed
into
the
next

the
querulous
sounds
of
his
voice
were
at
once

from
chapter
xi

still
following

out
of

entered
and
nodding

to
be
ready
to
receive

prince

went
out
into
the
where
the
who
looked
was

was
talking
to
him
with
particular
warmth
and
the

by

the

advantage
of

came
out

into
the

with
some
maps

he
spread
on

put
questions
on
which
he
wished
to
hear
the
opinion
of
the
gentlemen

had
happened
was
that

afterwards
proved
to
be

been
received
during
the
night
of
a
movement
by
the
french
to
outflank
the
drissa
the
first
to
speak
was
general
armfeldt
to
meet
the
difficulty
that
presented
unexpectedly
proposed
a
perfectly
new
position
away
from
the
petersburg
and
moscow
the
reason
for
this
was
inexplicable
he
wished
to
show
that
could
have
an
but
he
urged
that
at
this
point
the
army
should
unite
and
there
await
the
it
was
plain
that
armfeldt
had
thought
out
that
plan
long
ago
and
now
expounded
it
not
so
much
to
answer
the
questions
in
his
plan

not

himself
of
the
opportunity
to
air
it

one
of
the
millions
of
one
as
good
as
that

be
made
as
long
as
it
was
quite
unknown

disputed
his

defended
young
count
toll
objected
to
the
swedish
views
more
warmly
than
anyone
and
in
the
course
of
the
dispute
drew
from
his
side
pocket
a
which
he
asked
permission
to
read
to
in
these
voluminous
notes
toll
suggested
another
totally
different

an

could
alone
extricate
us
from

from

in

we
were
during
all
these
discussions

and
his
wolzogen

were

snorted
contemptuously
and
turned
to
show
that
he
would
never
demean
himself
by
replying
to
such
nonsense
as
he
was
now
so
when
prince
who
was
in

called
on
him

merely
ask

proposed
a
splendid

why
not

a
also
why
ask

you
yourselves
know
everything
better
than

when
volkonski
with
a

it
was
in

he
asked
his
pfuel
rose
suddenly
growing

to

said
drumming
on
the
table
with
his
bony
is
the
he
went
up
to
the
map
and
speaking
rapidly
began
proving
that
no
eventuality
could
alter
the
efficiency
of
the
drissa
that
everything
had
been
and
that
if
the
enemy
were
really
going
to
outflank
the
enemy
would
inevitably
be
who
did
not
know
began
questioning
him

wolzogen

to
the
assistance
of
his
who
spoke
french
and
began
translating
for
hardly
able
to
keep
pace
with
who
was
rapidly
demonstrating
that
not
only
all
that
had
but
all
that
could
had
been
foreseen
in
his
and
that
if
there
were
now
any
difficulties
the
whole
fault
lay
in
the
fact
that
his
plan
had
not
been
precisely
he
kept
laughing
he
and
at
last
contemptuously
ceased
to
like
a
mathematician
who
ceases
to
prove
in
various
ways
the
accuracy
of
a
problem
that
has
already
been
wolzogen
took
his
place
and
continued
to
explain
his
views
in
every
now
and
then
turning
to
pfuel
and
it
not
your

like
a
man
heated
in

fight

he

no

only
desired
that

one
common
trait
that
had
not
been

at
the

in
there
was
now
a
panic
fear
of
though
was
noticeable
in
every

was

to
be
possible

they

him
from

shatter

to
consider
napoleon
a
barbarian
like
everyone
else

opposed

besides
this
feeling
of
pfuel
evoked
pity
in
prince
from
the
tone
in
which
the
courtiers
addressed
him
and
the
way
paulucci
had
allowed
himself
to
speak
of
him
to
the
but
above
all
from
a
certain
desperation
in
own
it
was
clear
that
the
others
and
pfuel
himself
that
his
fall
was
at
and
despite
his
and
grumpy
german
sarcasm
he
was
with
his
hair
smoothly
brushed
on
the
temples
and
sticking
up
in
tufts
though
he
concealed
the
fact
under
a
show
of
irritation
and
he
was
evidently
in
despair
that
the
sole
remaining
chance
of
verifying
his
theory
by
a
huge
experiment
and
proving
its
soundness
to
the
whole
world
was
slipping
away
from
the
discussions
continued
a
long
and
the
longer
they
lasted
the
more
heated
became
the
culminating
in
shouts
and
and
the
less
was
it
possible
to
arrive
at
any
general
conclusion
from
all
that
had
been
prince
listening
to
this
polyglot
talk
and
to
these
and
felt
nothing
but
amazement
at
what
they
were
a
thought
that
had
long
since
and
often
occurred
to
him
during
his
military
idea
that
there
is
not
and
cannot
be
any
science
of
and
that
therefore
there
can
be
no
such
thing
as
a
military
appeared
to
him
an
obvious
theory
and
science
is
possible
about
a
matter
the
conditions
and
circumstances
of
which
are
unknown
and
cannot
be
especially
when
the
strength
of
the
acting
forces
cannot
be
no
one
was
or
is
able
to
foresee
in
what
condition
our
or
the
armies
will
be
in
a

no
one
can
gauge
the
force
of
this

that
there
is
not
a
coward
at
the
front

a
brave

jolly
lad

of
five
thousand
is
worth
thirty

at

while
at
times
fifty
thousand
run
from
eight
as
at
what
science
can
there
be
in
a
matter
in
as
in
all
practical
nothing
can
be
defined
and
everything
depends
on
innumerable
the
significance
of
which

particular
moment

one
knows

says
our
army
is

paulucci
says
we

that
the
worthlessness

they
are

advantages

who

because
military

are
invested
with
pomp

flatter
attributing

he

be
firmly
convinced
that

in

ranks
can

serve
with
assurance
of
being

thought
prince
andrew
as
he
listened
to
the
and
he
roused
himself
only
when
paulucci
called
him
and
everyone
was
at
the
review
next
day
the
emperor
asked
prince
andrew
where
he
would
like
to
and
prince
andrew
lost
his
standing
in
court
circles
forever
by
not
asking
to
remain
attached
to
the

for
permission
to
serve
in
the
chapter
xii
before
the
beginning
of
the
rostov

received
a
letter
from
his
parents
in

they
told
him
briefly
of
illness
and
the
breaking
off
of
her
engagement
to
prince
andrew
they
explained
by
having
rejected
and
again
asked
nicholas
to
retire
from
the
army
and
return
on
receiving
this
nicholas
did
not
even
make
any
attempt
to
get
leave
of
absence
or
to
retire
from
the
but
wrote
to
his
parents
that
he
was
sorry
natasha
was
ill
and
her
engagement
broken
and
that
he
would
do
all
he
could
to
meet
their
to
sonya
he
wrote
friend
of
my
he
but
honor
could
keep
me
from
returning
to

at
the
commencement
of
the
i
should
feel
not
only
in
my
eyes
but
in
my
if
i
preferred
my
own
happiness
to
my
love
and
duty
to

this
shall
be
our
last

i
am
still
alive

still
loved
by

will
throw
up
everything
and
fly
to
to
press
you
forever
to
my
ardent
it
in
only
the
commencement
of
the
campaign
that
prevented
rostov
from
returning
home
as
he
had
promised
and
marrying
the
autumn
in
otradnoe
with
the
and
the
winter
with
the
christmas
holidays
and
had
opened
out
to
him
a
vista
of
tranquil
rural
joys
and
peace
such
as
he
had
never
known
and
which
now
allured
splendid
a
good
pack
of
a
dozen
leashes
of
smart
service
by
thought
but
now
the
campaign
was
and
he
had
to
remain
with
his
and
since
it
had
to
be
nicholas
as
was
natural
to
felt
contented
with
the
life
he
led
in
the
regiment
and
was
able
to
find
pleasure
in
that
on
his
return
from
his
furlough
having
been
joyfully
welcomed
by
his
was
sent
to
obtain
remounts
and
brought
back
from
the
ukraine
excellent
horses
which
pleased
him
and
earned
him
commendation
from
his
during
his
absence
he
had
been
promoted
and
when
the
regiment
was
put
on
war
footing
with
an
increase
in
he
was
again
allotted
his
old
the
campaign
the
regiment
was
moved
into
poland
on
double
new
officers
new
men
and
and
above
all
everybody
was
infected
with
the
merrily
excited
mood
that
goes
with
the
commencement
of
a
and
conscious
of
his
advantageous
position
in
the
devoted
himself
entirely
to
the
pleasures
and
interests
of
military
though
he
knew
that
sooner
or
later
he
would
have
to
relinquish
the
troops
retired
from
vilna
for
various
complicated
reasons
of
political
and
each
step
of
the
retreat
was
accompanied
by
a
complicated
interplay
of
and
passions
at
for
the
pavlograd
the
whole
of
this
retreat
during
the
finest
period
of
summer
and
with
sufficient
supplies
was
a
very
simple
and
agreeable
it
was
only
at
headquarters
that
there
was
and
in
the
body
of
the
army
they
did
not
ask
themselves
where
they
were
going
or
if
they
regretted
having
to
it
was
only
because
they
had
to
leave
billets
they
had
grown
accustomed
or
some
pretty
young
polish
if
the
thought
that
things
looked
bad
chanced
to
enter
he
tried
to
be
as
cheerful
as
befits
a
good
soldier
and
not
to
think
of
the
general
trend
of
but
only
of
the
task
nearest
to
first
they
camped
gaily
before
making
acquaintance
with
the
polish
preparing
for
reviews
and
being
reviewed
by
the
emperor
and
other
high
then
came
an
order
to
retreat
to
sventsyani
and
destroy
any
provisions
they
could
not
carry
away
with
sventsyani
was
remembered
by
the
hussars
only
as
the
drunken
a
name
the
whole
army
gave
to
their
encampment
and
because
many
complaints
were
made
against
the
taking
advantage
of
the
order
to
collect
took
also
and
carpets
from
the
polish
rostov
remembered
because
on
the
first
day
of
their
arrival
at
that
small
town
he
changed
his
sergeant
major
and
was
unable
to
manage
all
the
drunken
men
of
his
squadron
unknown
to
had
appropriated
five
barrels
of
old
from
sventsyani
they
retired
farther
and
farther
to
and
thence
again
beyond
drawing
near
to
the
frontier
of
russia
on
the
thirteenth
of
july
the
pavlograds
took
part
in
a
serious
action
for
the
first
on
the
twelfth
of
on
the
eve
of
that
there
was
a
heavy
storm
of
rain
and
in
the
summer
of
1812
was
remarkable
for
its
the
two
pavlograd
squadrons
were
bivouacking
on
a
field
of
which
was
already
in
ear
but
had
been
completely
trodden
down
by
cattle
and
the
rain
was
descending
in
and
with
a
young
officer
named
his
was
sitting
in
a
hastily
constructed
an
officer
of
their
with
long
mustaches
extending
onto
his
who
after
riding
to
the
staff
had
been
overtaken
by
the
entered
have
come
from
the
have
you
heard
of
and
the
officer
gave
them
details
of
the
saltanov
which
he
had
heard
at
the
smoking
his
pipe
and
turning
his
head
about
as
the
water
trickled
down
his
listened
with
an
occasional
glance
at
who
was
pressing
close
to
this
a
lad
of
sixteen
who
had
recently
joined
the
was
now
in
the
same
relation
to
nicholas
that
nicholas
had
been
to
denisov
seven
years
ilyin
tried
to
imitate
rostov
in
everything
and
adored
him
as
a
girl
might
have
the
officer
with
the
long
spoke
grandiloquently
of
the
saltanov
dam
being
russian
and
of
how
a
deed
worthy
of
antiquity
had
been
performed
by
general
he
recounted
how
raevski
had
led
his
two
sons
onto
the
dam
under
terrific
fire
and
had
charged
with
them
beside
rostov
heard
the
story
and
not
only
said
nothing
to
encourage
enthusiasm
on
the
looked
like
a
man
ashamed
of
what
he
was
though
with
no
intention
of
contradicting
since
the
campaigns
of
austerlitz
and
of
1807
rostov
knew
by
experience
that
men
always
lie
when
describing
military
as
he
himself
had
done
when
recounting
besides
he
had
experience
enough
to
know
that
nothing
happens
in
war
at
all
as
we
can
imagine
or
relate
and
so
he
did
not
like
nor
did
he
like
zdrzhinski
himself
with
his
mustaches
extending
over
his
bent
low
over
the
face
of
his
as
was
his
and
crowded
rostov
in
the
narrow
rostov
looked
at
him
in
the
first
there
must
have
been
such
a
confusion
and
crowding
on
the
dam
that
was
being
attacked
that
if
raevski
did
lead
his
sons
it
could
have
had
no
effect
except
perhaps
on
some
dozen
men
nearest
to
thought
rest
could
not
have
seen
how
or
with
whom
raevski
came
onto
the
and
even
those
who
did
see
it
would
not
have
been
much
stimulated
by
for
what
had
they
to
do
with
tender
paternal
feelings
when
their
own
skins
were
in
and
the
fate
of
the
fatherland
did
not
depend
on
whether
they
took
the
saltanov
dam
or
as
we
are
told
was
the
case
at
so
why
should
he
have
made
such
a
and
why
expose
his
own
children
in
the
i
would
not
have
taken
my
brother
petya
or
even
a
stranger
to
me
but
a
nice
but
would
have
tried
to
put
them
somewhere
under
nicholas
continued
to
as
he
listened
to
but
he
did
not
express
his
for
in
such
he
had
gained
he
knew
that
this
tale
redounded
to
the
glory
of
our
arms
and
so
one
had
to
pretend
not
to
doubt
and
he
acted
stand
this
any
said
noticing
that
rostov
did
not
relish
stockings
and
and
the
water
is
running
on
my
go
and
look
for
the
rain
seems
less
ilyin
went
out
and
zdrzhinski
rode
five
minutes
later
splashing
through
the
came
running
back
to
the
come
found
about
two
hundred
yards
away
a
tavern
where
ours
have
already
we
can
at
least
get
dry
and
mary
mary
hendrikhovna
was
the
wife
of
the
regimental
a
pretty
young
german
woman
he
had
married
in
the
whether
from
lack
of
means
or
because
he
did
not
like
to
part
from
his
young
wife
in
the
early
days
of
their
took
her
about
with
him
wherever
the
hussar
regiment
went
and
his
jealousy
had
become
a
standing
joke
among
the
hussar
rostov
threw
his
cloak
over
his
shouted
to
lavrushka
to
follow
with
the
slipping
in
the
now
splashing
right
through
off
with
ilyin
in
the
lessening
rain
and
the
darkness
that
was
occasionally
rent
by
distant
where
are
what
they
called
to
one
chapter
xiii
in
the
before
which
stood
the
covered
there
were
already
some
five
mary
a
plump
little
blonde
in
a
dressing
jacket
and
was
sitting
on
a
broad
bench
in
the
front
her
the
lay
asleep
behind
rostov
and
on
entering
the
were
welcomed
with
merry
shouts
and
how
jolly
we
said
rostov
why
do
you
stand
there
swells
they
the
water
streams
from
make
our
drawing
room
so
mess
mary
cried
other
rostov
and
ilyin
hastened
to
find
a
corner
where
they
could
change
into
dry
clothes
without
offending
mary
they
were
going
into
a
tiny
recess
behind
a
partition
to
but
found
it
completely
filled
by
three
officers
who
sat
playing
cards
by
the
light
of
a
solitary
candle
on
an
empty
and
these
officers
would
on
no
account
yield
their
mary
hendrikhovna
obliged
them
with
the
loan
of
a
petticoat
to
be
used
as
a
and
behind
that
screen
rostov
and
helped
by
lavrushka
who
had
brought
their
changed
their
wet
things
for
dry
a
fire
was
made
up
in
the
dilapidated
brick
a
board
was
fixed
on
two
saddles
and
covered
with
a
a
small
samovar
was
produced
and
a
cellaret
and
half
a
bottle
of
and
having
asked
mary
hendrikhovna
to
they
all
crowded
round
one
offered
her
a
clean
handkerchief
to
wipe
her
charming
another
spread
a
jacket
under
her
little
feet
to
keep
them
from
the
another
hung
his
coat
over
the
window
to
keep
out
the
and
yet
another
waved
the
flies
off
her
lest
he
should
wake
him
said
mary
smiling
timidly
and
is
sleeping
well
as
it
after
a
sleepless
mary
replied
the
must
look
after
the
perhaps
take
pity
on
me
when
it
comes
to
cutting
off
a
leg
or
an
arm
for
there
were
only
three
the
water
was
so
muddy
that
one
could
not
make
out
whether
the
tea
was
strong
or
and
the
samovar
held
only
six
tumblers
of
but
this
made
it
all
the
pleasanter
to
take
turns
in
order
of
seniority
to
receive
tumbler
from
mary
plump
little
hands
with
their
short
and
not
overclean
all
the
officers
appeared
to
and
really
in
love
with
her
that
even
those
playing
cards
behind
the
partition
soon
left
their
game
and
came
over
to
the
yielding
to
the
general
mood
of
courting
mary
seeing
herself
surrounded
by
such
brilliant
and
polite
young
beamed
with
try
as
she
might
to
hide
and
perturbed
as
she
evidently
was
each
time
her
husband
moved
in
his
sleep
behind
there
was
only
one
sugar
was
more
plentiful
than
anything
but
it
took
too
long
to
so
it
was
decided
that
mary
hendrikhovna
should
stir
the
sugar
for
everyone
in
rostov
received
his
and
adding
some
rum
to
it
asked
mary
hendrikhovna
to
stir
you
take
it
without
she
smiling
all
the
as
if
everything
she
said
and
everything
the
others
said
was
very
amusing
and
had
a
double
is
not
the
sugar
i
but
only
that
your
little
hand
should
stir
my
mary
hendrikhovna
assented
and
began
looking
for
the
spoon
which
someone
meanwhile
had
pounced
your
mary
it
will
be
still
said
she
blushing
with
ilyin
put
a
few
drops
of
rum
into
the
bucket
of
water
and
brought
it
to
mary
asking
her
to
stir
it
with
her
is
my
said
dip
your
finger
in
it
and
drink
it
all
when
they
had
emptied
the
rostov
took
a
pack
of
cards
and
proposed
that
they
should
play
with
mary
they
drew
lots
to
settle
who
should
make
up
her
at
suggestion
it
was
agreed
that
whoever
became
should
have
the
right
to
kiss
mary
and
that
the
should
go
to
refill
and
reheat
the
samovar
for
the
doctor
when
the
latter
but
supposing
mary
hendrikhovna
is
asked
it
she
is
and
her
word
is
they
had
hardly
begun
to
play
before
the
disheveled
head
suddenly
appeared
from
behind
mary
he
had
been
awake
for
some
listening
to
what
was
being
and
evidently
found
nothing
entertaining
or
amusing
in
what
was
going
his
face
was
sad
and
without
greeting
the
he
scratched
himself
and
asked
to
be
allowed
to
pass
as
they
were
blocking
the
as
soon
as
he
had
left
the
room
all
the
officers
burst
into
loud
laughter
and
mary
hendrikhovna
blushed
till
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
thereby
became
still
more
attractive
to
returning
from
the
the
doctor
told
his
wife
had
ceased
to
smile
so
and
looked
at
him
in
awaiting
her
that
the
rain
had
ceased
and
they
must
go
to
sleep
in
their
covered
or
everything
in
it
would
be
send
an
two
of
said
an
stand
guard
on
it
said
you
have
had
your
but
i
have
not
slept
for
two
replied
the
and
he
sat
down
morosely
beside
his
waiting
for
the
game
to
seeing
his
gloomy
face
as
he
frowned
at
his
the
officers
grew
still
and
some
of
them
could
not
refrain
from
for
which
they
hurriedly
sought
plausible
when
he
had
taking
his
wife
with
and
had
settled
down
with
her
in
their
covered
the
officers
lay
down
in
the
covering
themselves
with
their
wet
but
they
did
not
sleep
for
a
long
now
they
exchanged
recalling
the
uneasiness
and
his
now
they
ran
out
into
the
porch
and
reported
what
was
taking
place
in
the
covered
several
times
covering
his
tried
to
go
to
but
some
remark
would
arouse
him
and
conversation
would
be
to
the
accompaniment
of
childlike
chapter
xiv
it
was
nearly
three
but
no
one
was
yet
when
the
quartermaster
appeared
with
an
order
to
move
on
to
the
little
town
of
still
laughing
and
the
officers
began
hurriedly
getting
ready
and
again
boiled
some
muddy
water
in
the
but
rostov
went
off
to
his
squadron
without
waiting
for
day
was
the
rain
had
and
the
clouds
were
it
felt
damp
and
especially
in
clothes
that
were
still
as
they
left
the
tavern
in
the
twilight
of
the
rostov
and
ilyin
both
glanced
under
the
wet
and
glistening
leather
hood
of
the
from
under
the
apron
of
which
his
feet
were
sticking
and
in
the
middle
of
which
his
nightcap
was
visible
and
her
sleepy
breathing
really
is
a
dear
little
said
rostov
to
who
was
following
charming
said
with
all
the
gravity
of
a
boy
of
half
an
hour
later
the
squadron
was
lined
up
on
the
the
command
was
heard
to
and
the
soldiers
crossed
themselves
and
rostov
riding
in
front
gave
the
order
and
the
with
clanking
sabers
and
subdued
their
hoofs
splashing
in
the
defiled
in
fours
and
moved
along
the
broad
road
planted
with
birch
trees
on
each
following
the
infantry
and
a
battery
that
had
gone
on
in
reddening

scudding
before
the
it
was
growing
lighter
and
that
curly
grass
which
always
grows
by
country
roadsides

clearly

wet

the
drooping
branches
of

by

along
the
side
of
the
road
between
two
rows
of
birch
when
rostov
allowed
himself
the
indulgence
of
riding
not
a
regimental
but
a
cossack
a
judge
of
horses
and
a
he
had
lately
procured
himself
a
donets
with
light
mane
and
and
when
he
rode
it
no
one
could
outgallop
to
ride
this
horse
was
a
pleasure
to
and
he
thought
of
the
of
the
of
the
but
not
once
of
the
impending
when
going
into
rostov
had
felt
now
he
had
not
the
least
feeling
of
he
was
not
because
he
had
grown
used
to
being
under
fire
cannot
grow
used
to
but
because
he
had
learned
how
to
manage
his
thoughts
when
in
he
had
grown
accustomed
when
going
into
action
to
think
about
anything
but
what
would
seem
most
likely
to
interest
impending
during
the
first
period
of
his
hard
as
he
tried
and
much
as
he
reproached
himself
with
he
had
not
been
able
to
do
but
with
time
it
had
come
of
now
he
rode
beside
ilyin
under
the
birch
occasionally
plucking
leaves
from
a
branch
that
met
his
sometimes
touching
his
side
with
his
without
turning
handing
a
pipe
he
had
finished
to
an
hussar
riding
behind
with
as
calm
and
careless
an
air
as
though
he
were
merely
out
for
a
he
glanced
with
pity
at
the
excited
face
of
who
talked
much
and
in
great
he
knew
from
experience

his

brilliant
exploit

began
to
or
tried
to
sing
by
tears
choked
tears
of
tears
at
the
recollection
of
those
pure
times
which
could
never
tears
of
vexation
that
she
should
so
uselessly
have
ruined
her
young
life
which
might
have
been
so
laughter
and
singing
in
particular
seemed
to
her
like
a
in
face
of
her
without
any
need
of
no
wish
to
coquet
ever
entered
her
she
said
and
felt
at
that
time
that
no
man
was
more
to
her
than
nastasya
the
something
stood
sentinel
within
her
and
forbade
her
every
she
had
lost
all
the
old
interests
of
her
carefree
girlish
life
that
had
been
so
full
of
the
previous
the
and
the
christmas
holidays
spent
with
nicholas
at
otradnoe
were
what
she
recalled
oftenest
and
most
what
would
she
not
have
given
to
bring
back
even
a
single
day
of
that
but
it
was
gone
her
presentiment
at
the
time
had
not
deceived
that
state
of
freedom
and
readiness
for
any
enjoyment
would
not
return
yet
it
was
necessary
to
live
it
comforted
her
to
reflect
that
she
was
not
better
as
she
had
formerly
but
much
than
anybody
else
in
the
but
this
was
not
she
knew
and
asked
but
there
was
nothing
to
there
was
no
joy
in
yet
life
was
natasha
apparently
tried
not
to
be
a
burden
or
a
hindrance
to
but
wanted
nothing
for
she
kept
away
from
everyone
in
the
house
and
felt
at
ease
only
with
her
brother
she
liked
to
be
with
him
better
than
with
the
and
when
alone
with
him
she
sometimes
she
hardly
ever
left
the
house
and
of
those
who
came
to
see
them
was
glad
to
see
only
one
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
treat
her
with
more
greater
and
at
the
same
time
more
seriously
than
did
count
natasha
unconsciously
felt
this
delicacy
and
so
found
great
pleasure
in
his
but
she
was
not
even
grateful
to
him
for
nothing
good
on
part
seemed
to
her
to
be
an
it
seemed
so
natural
for
him
to
be
kind
to
everyone
that
there
was
no
merit
in
his
sometimes
natasha
noticed
embarrassment
and
awkwardness
on
his
part
in
her
especially
when
he
wanted
to
do
something
to
please
or
feared
that
something
they
spoke
of
would
awaken
memories
distressing
to
she
noticed
this
and
attributed
it
to
his
general
kindness
and
which
she
imagined
must
be
the
same
toward
everyone
as
it
was
to
after
those
involuntary
if
he
were
free
he
would
have
asked
on
his
knees
for
her
hand
and
her
at
a
moment
when
she
was
so
strongly
pierre
never
spoke
to
natasha
of
his
and
it
seemed
plain
to
her
that
those
which
had
then
so
comforted
were
spoken
as
all
sorts
of
meaningless
words
are
spoken
to
comfort
a
crying
it
was
not
because
pierre
was
a
married
but
because
natasha
felt
very
strongly
with
him
that
moral
barrier
the
absence
of
which
she
had
experienced
with
kuragin
that
it
never
entered
her
head
that
the
relations
between
him
and
herself
could
lead
to
love
on
her
still
less
on
or
even
to
the
kind
of
romantic
friendship
between
a
man
and
a
woman
of
which
she
had
known
several
before
the
end
of
the
fast
of
agrafena
ivanovna
a
country
neighbor
of
the
came
to
moscow
to
pay
her
devotions
at
the
shrines
of
the
moscow
she
suggested
that
natasha
should
fast
and
prepare
for
holy
and
natasha
gladly
welcomed
the
despite
the
orders
that
she
should
not
go
out
early
in
the
natasha
insisted
on
fasting
and
preparing
for
the
not
as
they
generally
prepared
for
it
in
the
rostov
family
by
attending
three
services
in
their
own
but
as
agrafena
ivanovna
by
going
to
church
every
day
for
a
week
and
not
once
missing
or
the
countess
was
pleased
with
after
the
poor
results
of
the
medical
in
the
depths
of
her
heart
she
hoped
that
prayer
might
help
her
daughter
more
than
medicines
though
not
without
fear
and
concealing
it
from
the
she
agreed
to
wish
and
entrusted
her
to
agrafena
ivanovna
used
to
come
to
wake
natasha
at
three
in
the
but
generally
found
her
already
she
was
afraid
of
being
late
for
hastily
and
meekly
putting
on
her
shabbiest
dress
and
an
old
shivering
in
the
fresh
went
out
into
the
deserted
streets
lit
by
the
clear
light
of
by
agrafena
advice
natasha
prepared
herself
not
in
their
own
but
at
a
church
according
to
the
devout
agrafena
the
priest
was
a
man
of
very
severe
and
lofty
there
were
never
many
people
in
the
natasha
always
stood
beside
belova
in
the
customary
place
before
an
icon
of
the
blessed
let
into
the
screen
before
the
choir
on
the
left
and
a
new
to
of
humility
before
something
great
and
seized
her
when
at
that
unusual
morning
gazing
at
the
dark
face
of
the
virgin
illuminated
by
the
candles
burning
before
it
and
by
the
morning
light
falling
from
the
she
listened
to
the
words
of
the
service
which
she
tried
to
follow
with
when
she
understood
them
her
personal
feeling
became
interwoven
in
the
prayers
with
shades
of
its
when
she
did
not
it
was
sweeter
still
to
think
that
the
wish
to
understand
everything
is
that
it
is
impossible
to
understand
that
it
is
only
necessary
to
believe
and
to
commit
oneself
to
whom
she
felt
guiding
her
soul
at
those
she
crossed
bowed
and
when
she
did
not
in
horror
at
her
own
simply
asked
god
to
forgive
her
to
have
mercy
upon
the
prayers
to
which
she
surrendered
herself
most
of
all
were
those
of
on
her
way
home
at
an
early
hour
when
she
met
no
one
but
bricklayers
going
to
work
or
men
sweeping
the
and
everybody
within
the
houses
was
still
natasha
experienced
a
feeling
new
to
a
sense
of
the
possibility
of
correcting
her
the
possibility
of
a
clean
and
of
during
the
whole
week
she
spent
in
this
that
feeling
grew
every
and
the
happiness
of
taking
or
as
agrafena
joyously
playing
with
the
called
seemed
to
natasha
so
great
that
she
felt
she
should
never
live
till
that
blessed
but
the
happy
day
and
on
that
memorable
dressed
in
white
she
returned
home
after
for
the
first
time
for
many
months
she
felt
calm
and
not
oppressed
by
the
thought
of
the
life
that
lay
before
the
doctor
who
came
to
see
her
that
day
ordered
her
to
continue
the
powders
he
had
prescribed
a
fortnight
must
certainly
go
on
taking
them
morning
and
said
evidently
sincerely
satisfied
with
his
please
be
particular
about
quite
he
continued
as
he
adroitly
took
the
gold
coin
in
his
will
soon
be
singing
and
frolicking
the
last
medicine
has
done
her
a
very
great
deal
of
she
has
freshened
up
very
the
with
a
cheerful
expression
on
her
looked
down
at
her
nails
and
spat
a
little
for
luck
as
she
returned
to
the
drawing
chapter
xviii
at
the
beginning
of
july
more
and
more
disquieting
reports
about
the
war
began
to
spread
in
people
spoke
of
an
appeal
by
the
emperor
to
the
and
of
his
coming
himself
from
the
army
to
and
as
up
to
the
eleventh
of
july
no
manifesto
or
appeal
had
been
exaggerated
reports
became
current
about
them
and
about
the
position
of
it
was
said
that
the
emperor
was
leaving
the
army
because
it
was
in
it
was
said
that
smolensk
had
that
napoleon
had
an
army
of
a
million
and
only
a
miracle
could
save
on
the
eleventh
of
which
was
the
manifesto
was
received
but
was
not
yet
in
and
who
was
at
the
promised
to
come
to
dinner
next
and
bring
a
copy
of
the
manifesto
and
which
he
would
obtain
from
count
that
the
rostovs
went
to
mass
at
the
private
chapel
as
it
was
a
hot
july
even
at
ten
when
the
rostovs
got
out
of
their
carriage
at
the
the
sultry
the
shouts
of
the
light
and
gay
summer
clothes
of
the
the
dusty
leaves
of
the
trees
on
the
the
sounds
of
the
band
and
the
white
trousers
of
a
battalion
marching
to
the
rattling
of
wheels
on
the
and
the
hot
sunshine
were
all
full
of
that
summer
that
content
and
discontent
with
the
which
is
most
strongly
felt
on
a
hot
day
in
all
the
moscow
all
the
were
at
the
as
if
expecting
something
to
many
wealthy
families
who
usually
left
town
for
their
country
estates
had
not
gone
away
that
as
at
her
passed
through
the
crowd
behind
a
liveried
footman
who
cleared
the
way
for
she
heard
a
young
man
speaking
about
her
in
too
loud
a
the
one
much
but
all
the
same
she
or
thought
she
the
names
of
kuragin
and
but
she
was
always
imagining
it
always
seemed
to
her
that
everyone
who
looked
at
her
was
thinking
only
of
what
had
happened
to
with
a
sinking
wretched
as
she
always
was
now
when
she
found
herself
in
a
natasha
in
her
lilac
silk
dress
trimmed
with
black
lace
women
can
the
more
repose
and
stateliness
the
greater
the
pain
and
shame
in
her
she
knew
for
certain
that
she
was
but
this
no
longer
gave
her
satisfaction
as
it
used
on
the
contrary
it
tormented
her
more
than
anything
else
of
and
particularly
so
on
this
hot
summer
day
in
sunday
week
she
recalling
that
she
had
been
here
the
sunday
always
the
same
life
that
is
no
and
the
same
surroundings
in
which
it
used
to
be
so
easy
to
and
i
know
that
now
i
am
i
used
to
be
but
now
i
know
i
am
she
yet
my
best
years
are
slipping
by
and
are
no
good
to
she
stood
by
her
side
and
exchanged
nods
with
acquaintances
near
from
habit
she
scrutinized
the
condemned
the
bearing
of
a
lady
standing
close
by
who
was
not
crossing
herself
properly
but
in
a
cramped
and
again
she
thought
with
vexation
that
she
was
herself
being
judged
and
was
judging
and
at
the
sound
of
the
she
felt
horrified
at
her
own
horrified
that
the
former
purity
of
her
soul
was
again
lost
to
a
old
man
was
conducting
the
service
with
that
mild
solemnity
which
has
so
elevating
and
soothing
an
effect
on
the
souls
of
the
the
gates
of
the
sanctuary
screen
were
the
curtain
was
slowly
and
from
behind
it
a
soft
mysterious
voice
pronounced
some
the
cause
of
which
she
herself
did
not
made
breast
and
a
joyous
but
oppressive
feeling
agitated
me
what
i
should
how
to
live
my
how
i
may
grow
good
she
the
deacon
came
out
onto
the
raised
space
before
the
altar
screen
holding
his
thumb
drew
his
long
hair
from
under
his
dalmatic
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
on
his
began
in
a
loud
and
solemn
voice
to
recite
the
words
of
the
peace
let
us
pray
unto
the
one
without
distinction
of
without
united
by
brotherly
us
thought
the
peace
that
is
from
and
for
the
salvation
of
our
the
world
of
angels
and
all
the
spirits
who
dwell
above
prayed
when
they
prayed
for
the
she
thought
of
her
brother
and
when
they
prayed
for
all
traveling
by
land
and
she
remembered
prince
prayed
for
and
asked
god
to
forgive
her
all
the
wrongs
she
had
done
when
they
prayed
for
those
who
love
she
prayed
for
the
members
of
her
own
her
father
and
mother
and
realizing
for
the
first
time
how
wrongly
she
had
acted
toward
and
feeling
all
the
strength
of
her
love
for
when
they
prayed
for
those
who
hate
she
tried
to
think
of
her
enemies
and
people
who
hated
in
order
to
pray
for
she
included
among
her
enemies
the
creditors
and
all
who
had
business
dealings
with
her
and
always
at
the
thought
of
enemies
and
those
who
hated
her
she
remembered
anatole
who
had
done
her
so
much
though
he
did
not
hate
her
she
gladly
prayed
for
him
as
for
an
only
at
prayer
did
she
feel
able
to
think
clearly
and
calmly
of
prince
andrew
and
as
men
for
whom
her
feelings
were
as
nothing
compared
with
her
awe
and
devotion
to
when
they
prayed
for
the
imperial
family
and
the
she
bowed
very
low
and
made
the
sign
of
the
saying
to
herself
that
even
if
she
did
not
still
she
could
not
and
at
any
rate
loved
the
governing
synod
and
prayed
for
when
he
had
finished
the
litany
the
deacon
crossed
the
stole
over
his
breast
and
us
commit
ourselves
and
our
whole
lives
to
christ

how
to
use
my
take

prayed
with
impatient
emotion
in
her
not
crossing
herself
but
letting
her
slender
arms
hang
down
as
if
expecting
some
invisible
power
at
any
moment
to
take
her
and
deliver
her
from
from
her
and
the
countess
looked
round
several
times
at
her
softened
face
and
shining
eyes
and
prayed
god
to
help
in
the
middle
of
the
and
not
in
the
usual
order
natasha
knew
so
the
deacon
brought
out
a
small
the
one
he
knelt
on
when
praying
on
trinity
and
placed
it
before
the
doors
of
the
sanctuary

priest

out
with
his
purple
velvet
biretta
on
his

down

who
hate
us
and
our
orthodox
faith
may
see
it
and
be
put
to
shame
and
and
may
all
the
nations
know
that

art

to
thee
be
all
to
and
holy
now
and
world
without
in
receptive
condition
of
soul
this
prayer
affected
her
she
listened
to
every
word
about
the
victory
of
moses
over
of
gideon
over
and
of
david
over
and
about
the
destruction
of
and
she
prayed
to
god
with
the
tenderness
and
emotion
with
which
her
heart
was
but
without
fully
understanding
what
she
was
asking
of
god
in
that
she
shared
with
all
her
heart
in
the
prayer
for
the
spirit
of
for
the
strengthening
of
the
heart
by
faith
and
and
its
animation
by
but
she
could
not
pray
that
her
enemies
might
be
trampled
under
foot
when
but
a
few
minutes
before
she
had
been
wishing
she
had
more
of
them
that
she
might
pray
for
but
neither
could
she
doubt
the
righteousness
of
the
prayer
that
was
being
read
on
bended
she
felt
in
her
heart
a
devout
and
tremulous
awe
at
the
thought
of
the
punishment
that
overtakes
men
for
their
and
especially
of
her
own
and
she
prayed
to
god
to
forgive
them
and
her
and
to
give
them
and
her
peace
and
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
god
heard
her
chapter
xix
from
the
day
when
after
leaving
the
with
grateful
look
fresh
in
his
had
gazed
at
the
comet
that
seemed
to
be
fixed
in
the
sky
and
felt
that
something
new
was
appearing
on
his
own
that
day
the
problem
of
the
vanity
and
uselessness
of
all
earthly
that
had
incessantly
tormented
no
longer
presented
that
terrible
question
which
had
come
to
him
amid
every
was
now
not
by
another
question
or
by
a
reply
to
the
former
but
by
her
when
he
listened
or
himself
took
part
trivial
when
he
read
or
heard
of
human
baseness
or
he
was
not
horrified
as
and
did
not
ask
himself
why
men
struggled
so
about
these
things
when
all
is
so
transient
and
he
remembered
her
as
he
had
last
seen
and
all
his
doubts
because
she
had
answered
the
questions
that
had
haunted
but
because
his
conception
of
her
transferred
him
instantly
to
a
realm
of
spiritual
activity
in
which
no
one
could
be
justified
or
realm
of
beauty
and
love
which
it
was
worth
living
whatever
worldly
baseness
presented
itself
to
he
said
to
supposing
swindled
the
country
and
the
and
the
country
and
the
tsar
confer
honors
upon
what
does
that
she
smiled
at
me
yesterday
and
asked
me
to
come
and
i
love
and
no
one
will
ever
know
and
his
soul
felt
calm
and
pierre
still
went
into
drank
as
much
and
led
the
same
idle
and
dissipated
because
besides
the
hours
he
spent
at
the
there
were
other
hours
he
had
to
spend
and
the
habits
and
acquaintances
he
had
made
in
moscow
formed
a
current
that
bore
him
along
but
when
more
and
more
disquieting
reports
came
from
the
seat
of
war
and
health
began
to
improve
and
she
no
longer
aroused
in
him
the
former
feeling
of
careful
an
increasing
which
he
could
not
took
possession
of
he
felt
that
the
condition
he
was
in
could
not
continue
that
a
catastrophe
was
coming
which
would
change
his
whole
and
he
impatiently
sought
everywhere
for
signs
of
that
approaching
one
of
his
brother
masons
had
revealed
to
pierre
the
following
prophecy
concerning
drawn
from
the
revelation
of
in

the

him

number
of
a
and
his
number
is
six

threescore

and
in
the
fifth
verse
of
the
same
and
there
was
given
unto
him
a
mouth
speaking
great
things
and
and
power
was
given
unto
him
to
continue
forty
and

writing
the
words
napoleon
in
it
appears
that
the
sum
of
them
is
and
that
napoleon
was
therefore
the
beast
foretold
in
the
by
applying
the
same
system
to
the
words
which
was
the
term
allowed
to
the
beast
that
great
things
and
the
same
number
666
was
from
which
it
followed
that
the
limit
fixed
for
power
had
come
in
the
year
1812
when
the
french
emperor
was
this
prophecy
pleased
pierre
very
much
and
he
often
asked
himself
what
would
put
an
end
to
the
power
of
the
that
of
and
tried
by
the
same
system
of
using
letters
as
numbers
and
adding
them
to
find
an
answer
to
the
question
that
engrossed
he
wrote
the
words
la
nation
russe
and
added
up
their
but
the
sums
were
either
more
or
less
than
once
when
making
such
calculations
he
wrote
down
his
own
name
in
comte
pierre
but
the
sum
of
the
numbers
did
not
come
then
he
changed
the
substituting
a
z
for
the
s
and
adding
de
and
the
article
still
without
obtaining
the
desired
then
it
occurred
to
if
the
answer
to
the
question
were
contained
in
his
his
nationality
would
also
be
given
in
the
so
he
wrote
le
russe
besuhof
and
adding
up
the
numbers
got
this
was
only
five
too
and
five
was
represented
by
the
very
letter
elided
from
the
article
le
before
the
word
by
omitting
the
though
pierre
got
the
answer
he
besuhof
made
this
discovery
excited
or
by
what
he
was
connected
with
the
great
event
foretold
in
the
apocalypse
he
did
not
but
he
did
not
doubt
that
connection
for
a
his
love
for
the
the
and
this
had
to
mature
and
to
lift
him
out
of
that
petty
sphere
of
moscow
habits
in
which
he
felt
himself
held
captive
and
lead
him
to
a
great
achievement
and
great
on
the
eve
of
the
sunday
when
the
special
prayer
was
pierre
had
promised
the
rostovs
to
bring
from
count
rostopchin
whom
he
knew
both
the
appeal
to
the
people
and
the
news
from
the
in
the
when
he
went
to
call
at
he
met
there
a
courier
fresh
from
the
an
acquaintance
of
his
who
often
danced
at
moscow
for
relieve
me
of
said
the
have
a
sackful
of
letters
to
among
these
letters
was
one
from
nicholas
rostov
to
his
pierre
took
that
and
rostopchin
also
gave
him
the
appeal
to
which
had
just
been
the
last
army
and
his
own
most
recent
glancing
through
the
army
pierre
found
in
one
of
in
the
lists
of
and
the
name
of
nicholas
awarded
a
cross
of
the
fourth
class
for
courage
shown
in
the
ostrovna
and
in
the
same
order
the
name
of
prince
andrew
appointed
to
the
command
of
a
regiment
of
though
he
did
not
want
to
remind
the
rostovs
of
pierre
could
not
refrain
from
making
them
happy
by
the
news
of
their
having
received
a
so
he
sent
that
printed
army
order
and
letter
to
the
keeping
the
the
and
the
other
orders
to
take
with
him
when
he
went
to
his
conversation
with
count
rostopchin
and
the
tone
of
anxious
the
meeting
with
the
courier
who
talked
casually
of
how
badly
things
were
going
in
the
the
rumors
of
the
discovery
of
spies
in
moscow
and
of
a
leaflet
in
circulation
stating
that
napoleon
promised
to
be
in
both
the
russian
capitals
by
the
and
the
talk
of
the
being
expected
to
arrive
next
aroused
with
fresh
force
that
feeling
of
agitation
and
expectation
in
pierre
which
he
had
been
conscious
of
ever
since
the
appearance
of
the
and
especially
since
the
beginning
of
the
he
had
long
been
thinking
of
entering
the
army
and
would
have
done
so
had
he
not
been
by
his
membership
of
the
society
of
freemasons
to
which
he
was
bound
by
oath
and
which
preached
perpetual
peace
and
the
abolition
of
and
by
the
fact
that
when
he
saw
the
great
mass
of
muscovites
who
had
donned
uniform
and
were
talking
he
somehow
felt
ashamed
to
take
the
but
the
chief
reason
for
not
carrying
out
his
intention
to
enter
the
army
lay
in
the
vague
idea
that
he
was
besuhof
who
had
the
number
of
the
that
his
part
in
the
great
affair
of
setting
a
limit
to
the
power
of
the
beast
that
spoke
great
and
blasphemous
things
had
been
predestined
from
and
that
therefore
he
ought
not
to
undertake
but
wait
for
what
was
bound
to
come
to
chapter
xx
a
few
intimate
friends
were
dining
with
the
rostovs
that
as
usual
on
pierre
came
early
so
as
to
find
them
he
had
grown
so
stout
this
year
that
he
would
have
been
abnormal
had
he
not
been
so
so
broad
of
and
so
strong
that
he
carried
his
bulk
with
evident
he
went
up
the
puffing
and
muttering
his
coachman
did
not
even
ask
whether
he
was
to
he
knew
that
when
his
master
was
at
the
he
stayed
till
the
footman
rushed
eagerly
forward
to
help
him
off
with
his
cloak
and
take
his
hat
and
from
club
always
left
both
hat
and
stick
in
the
the
first
person
he
saw
in
the
house
was
even
before
he
saw
while
taking
off
his
he
heard
she
was
practicing
solfa
exercises
in
the
music
he
knew
that
she
had
not
sung
since
her
and
so
the
sound
of
her
voice
surprised
and
delighted
he
opened
the
door
softly
and
saw
in
the
lilac
dress
she
had
worn
at
walking
about
the
room
she
had
her
back
to
him
when
he
opened
the
but
turning
she
saw
his
surprised
she
blushed
and
came
rapidly
up
to
want
to
try
to
sing
she
adding
as
if

something

glad

rapidly
and
did
not
notice
how
pierre
flushed
at
her

in
that
same
army
order
that
whispered
the
name
in
and
in
the
army
what

said
that

he
were
not
himself
but
the
best
man
in
the
world
and
he
would
ask
on
his
knees
for
her
and
the
same
feeling
of
and
love
took
possession
of
him
and
the
same
words
rose
to
his
but
she
did
not
give
him
time
to
say
she
uttering
the
word

different

soon
as
she

the
old
addressing
pierre
had
been
silent
and
preoccupied
all
through
seeming
not
to
grasp
what
was
he
looked
at
the
the
he
what
sort
of
warrior

and
yet
everything

dinner
the
count
settled
himself
comfortably
in
an
easy
chair
and
with
a
serious
face
asked

gazing

a
searching
look

at
her
father
and
now
at
pierre

her
eyes
on
him
and
tried
not
to
look
the
countess
shook
her
head
disapprovingly
and
angrily
at
every
solemn
expression
in
the
in
all
these
words
she
saw
only
that
the
danger
threatening
her
son
would
not
soon
be
with
a
sarcastic
smile
on
his
was
evidently
preparing
to
make
fun
of
anything
that
gave
him

resolutely
and
suddenly
they
looked
at

with
dismayed
and
embarrassed
he
tried
to
smile
but
could
his
smile
expressed
and
he
silently
kissed
her
hand
and
went
pierre
made
up
his
mind
not
to
go
to
the
any
chapter
xxi
after
the
definite
refusal
he
had
petya
went
to
his
room
and
there
locked
himself
in
and
wept
when
he
came
in
to
and
with
everybody
pretended
not
to
notice
next
day
the
emperor
arrived
in
and
several
of
the
domestic
serfs
begged
permission
to
go
to
have
a
look
at
that
morning
petya
was
a
long
time
dressing
and
arranging
his
hair
and
collar
to
look
like
a
he
frowned
before
his
looking
shrugged
his
and
without
saying
a
word
to
took
his
cap
and
left
the
house
by
the
back
trying
to
avoid
petya
decided
to
go
straight
to
where
the
emperor
was
and
to
explain
frankly
to
some
imagined
the
emperor
to
be
always
surrounded
by
that
count
in
spite
of
his
youth
wished
to
serve
his
that
youth
could
be
no
hindrance
to
and
that
he
was
ready
while
petya
had
prepared
many
fine
things
he
meant
to
say
to
the
it
was
on
the
very
fact
of
being
so
young
that
petya
counted
for
success
in
reaching
the
even
thought
how
surprised
everyone
would
be
at
his
yet
in
the
arrangement
of
his
collar
and
hair
and
by
his
sedate
deliberate
walk
he
wished
to
appear
a
but
the
farther
he
went
and
the
more
his
attention
was
diverted
by
the
crowds
moving
toward
the
the
less
he
remembered
to
walk
with
the
sedateness
and
deliberation
of
a
as
he
approached
the
kremlin
he
even
began
to
avoid
being
crushed
and
resolutely
stuck
out
his
elbows
in
a
menacing
but
within
the
trinity
gateway
he
was
so
pressed
to
the
wall
by
people
who
probably
were
unaware
of
the
patriotic
intentions
with
which
he
had
come
that
in
spite
of
all
his
determination
he
had
to
give
and
stop
while
carriages
passed
rumbling
beneath
the
beside
petya
stood
a
peasant
a
two
and
a
discharged
after
standing
some
time
in
the
petya
tried
to
move
forward
in
front
of
the
others
without
waiting
for
all
the
carriages
to
and
he
began
resolutely
working
his
way
with
his
but
the
woman
just
in
front
of
who
was
the
first
against
whom
he
directed
his
angrily
shouted
at
are
you
shoving
young
you
see
all
standing
then
why
can
said
the
and
also
began
working
his
elbows
to
such
effect
that
he
pushed
petya
into
a
very
filthy
corner
of
the
petya
wiped
his
perspiring
face
with
his
hands
and
pulled
up
the
damp
collar
which
he
had
arranged
so
well
at
home
to
seem
like
a
he
felt
that
he
no
longer
looked
and
feared
that
if
he
were
now
to
approach
the
in
that
plight
he
would
not
be
admitted
to
the
but
it
was
impossible
to
smarten
oneself
up
or
move
to
another
because
of
the
one
of
the
generals
who
drove
past
was
an
acquaintance
of
the
and
petya
thought
of
asking
his
but
came
to
the
conclusion
that
that
would
not
be
a
manly
thing
to
when
the
carriages
had
all
passed
the
carrying
petya
with
streamed
forward
into
the
kremlin
square
which
was
already
full
of
there
were
people
not
only
in
the
but
the
slopes
and
on
the
as
soon
as
petya
found
himself
in
the
square
he
clearly
heard
the
sound
of
bells
and
the
joyous
voices
of
the
crowd
that
filled
the
whole
for
a
while
the
crowd
was
less
but
suddenly
all
heads
were
and
everyone
rushed
forward
in
one
petya
was
being
pressed
so
that
he
could
scarcely
and
everybody
petya
stood
on
tiptoe
and
pushed
and
but
could
see
nothing
except
the
people
about
all
the
faces
bore
the
same
expression
of
excitement
and
a
wife
standing
beside
petya
and
the
tears
ran
down
her
dear
she
kept
wiping
away
her
tears
with
her
was
heard
on
all
for
a
moment
the
crowd
stood
but
then
it
made
another
rush
quite
beside
clinching
his
teeth
and
rolling
his
eyes
pushed
elbowing
his
way
and
shouting
as
if
he
were
prepared
that
instant
to
kill
himself
and
everyone
but
on
both
sides
of
him
other
people
with
similarly
ferocious
faces
pushed
forward
and
everybody
shouted
this
is
what
the
emperor
thought
i
petition
him
would
be
too
but
in
spite
of
this
he
continued
to
struggle
desperately
and
from
between
the
backs
of
those
in
front
he
caught
glimpses
of
an
open
space
with
a
strip
of
red
cloth
spread
out
on
but
just
then
the
crowd
swayed
police
in
front
were
pushing
back
those
who
had
pressed
too
close
to
the
the
emperor
was
passing
from
the
palace
to
the
cathedral
of
the
petya
unexpectedly
received
such
a
blow
on
his
side
and
ribs
and
was
squeezed
so
hard
that
suddenly
everything
grew
dim
before
his
eyes
and
he
lost
when
he
came
to
a
man
of
clerical
appearance
with
a
tuft
of
gray
hair
at
the
back
of
his
head
and
wearing
a
shabby
blue
a
church
clerk
and
holding
him
under
the
arm
with
one
hand
while
warding
off
the
pressure
of
the
crowd
with
the
crushed
the
young
said
the
are
you
up
crushed
crushed
the
emperor
entered
the
cathedral
of
the
the
crowd
spread
out
again
more
and
the
clerk
led
and
the
several
people
were
sorry
for
and
suddenly
a
crowd
turned
toward
him
and
pressed
round
those
who
stood
nearest
him
attended
to
unbuttoned
his
seated
him
on
the
raised
platform
of
the
and
reproached
those
others
they
might
who
had
crushed
might
easily
get
killed
that
what
do
they
mean
by
killing
poor
as
white
as
a
voices
were
heard
petya
soon
came
to
the
color
returned
to
his
the
pain
had
and
at
the
cost
of
that
temporary
unpleasantness
he
had
obtained
a
place
by
the
cannon
from
where
he
hoped
to
see
the
emperor
who
would
be
returning
that
petya
no
longer
thought
of
presenting
his
if
he
could
only
see
the
emperor
he
would
be
while
the
service
was
proceeding
in
the
cathedral
of
the
was
a
combined
service
of
prayer
on
the
occasion
of
the
arrival
and
of
thanksgiving
for
the
conclusion
of
peace
with
the
the
crowd
outside
spread
out
and
hawkers
selling
and
poppyseed
sweets
which
petya
was
particularly
and
ordinary
conversation
could
again
be
a
wife
was
showing
a
rent
in
her
shawl
and
telling
how
much
the
shawl
had

saying
that
all
silk
goods
had
now
got
the
clerk
who
had
rescued
petya
was
talking
to
a
functionary
about
the
priests
who
were
officiating
that
day
with
the
the
clerk
several
times
used
the
word
the
a
word
petya
did
not
two
young
citizens
were
joking
with
some
serf
girls
who
were
cracking
all
these
especially
the
joking
with
the
were
such
as
might
have
had
a
particular
charm
for
petya
at
his
but
they
did
not
interest
him
he
sat
on
his
pedestal
of
the
agitated
as
before
by
the
thought
of
the
emperor
and
by
his
love
for
the
feeling
of
pain
and
fear
he
had
experienced
when
he
was
being
together
with
that
of
still
further
intensified
his
sense
of
the
importance
of
the
suddenly
the
sound
of
a
firing
of
cannon
was
heard
from
the
to
celebrate
the
signing
of
peace
with
the
and
the
crowd
rushed
impetuously
toward
the
embankment
to
watch
the
petya
too
would
have
run
but
the
clerk
who
had
taken
the
young
gentleman
under
his
protection
stopped
the
firing
was
still
proceeding
when
and
came
running
out
of
the
and
after
them
others
in
a
more
leisurely
caps
were
again
and
those
who
had
run
to
look
at
the
cannon
ran
back
at
last
four
men
in
uniforms
and
sashes
emerged
from
the
cathedral
shouted
the
crowd
is
asked

in
a
tearful
of
those
around
but
no
one
answered
everybody
was
too
and
fixing
on
one
of
those
four
whom
he
could
not
clearly
see
for
the
tears
of
joy
that
filled
his

all
his
enthusiasm
on

not
to

was
drenched

did
not

with
that

rushed
at

he
had
to

he
felt
that

being
joyfully

by
various
happy

felt
sad
at
having
to

knowing
that
all
the
enjoyment
of
that
day
was

did
not
go
straight
home
from

called
on
his
friend

was
also
entering

returning
home
petya
announced
resolutely
and
firmly
that
if
he
was
not
allowed
to
enter
the
service
he
would
run
and
next
count
ilya
he
had
not

chapter
xxii
two
days
on
the
fifteenth
of
an
immense
number
of
carriages
were
standing
outside
the
sloboda
the
great
halls
were
in
the
first
were
the
nobility
and
gentry
in
their
in
the
second
bearded
merchants
in
coats
of
blue
cloth
and
wearing
in
the
hall
there
was
an
incessant
movement
and
buzz
of
the
chief
magnates
sat
on
backed
chairs
at
a
large
table
under
the
portrait
of
the
but
most
of
the
gentry
were
strolling
about
the
all
these
whom
pierre
met
every
day
at
the
club
or
in
their
own
were
in
in
that
of
others
in
that
of
emperor
others
again
in
the
new
uniforms
of
time
or
the
ordinary
uniform
of
the
and
the
general
characteristic
of
being
in
uniform
imparted
something
strange
and
fantastic
to
these
diverse
and
familiar
both
old
and
the
old
and
or
gaunt
and
were
especially
for
the
most
part
they
sat
quietly
in
their
places
and
were
if
they
walked
about
and
attached
themselves
to
someone
on
all
these
as
on
the
faces
of
the
crowd
petya
had
seen
in
the
there
was
a
striking
the
general
expectation
of
a
solemn
and
at
the
same
time
the
everyday
interests
in
a
boston
card
peter

zinaida
and
so
pierre
was
there
buttoned
up
since
early
morning
in
a
uniform
that
had
become
too
tight
for
he
was
this
extraordinary
gathering
not
only
of
nobles
but
also
of
the
etats
generaux
in
him
a
whole
series
of
ideas
he
had
long
laid
aside
but
which
were
deeply
graven
in
his
thoughts
of
the
contrat
social
and
the
french
the
words
that
had
struck
him
in
the
the
sovereign
was
coming
to
the
capital
for
consultation
with
his
this
and
imagining
that
in
this
direction
something
important
which
he
had
long
awaited
was
drawing
he
strolled
about
watching
and
listening
to
but
nowhere
finding
any
confirmation
of
the
ideas
that
occupied
the
manifesto
was
evoking
and
then
all
moved
about
discussing
besides
the
ordinary
topics
of
pierre
heard
questions
of
where
the
marshals
of
the
nobility
were
to
stand
when
the
emperor
when
a
ball
should

given
in
the
whether
they
should
group
themselves
by
districts
or
by
whole
and
so
but
as
soon
as
the
war
was
touched
or
what
the
nobility
had
been
convened
the
talk
became
undecided
and
then
all
preferred
listening
to
a
handsome
and
in
the
uniform
of
a
retired
naval
was
speaking
in
one
of
the
and
a
small
crowd
was
pressing
round
pierre
went
up
to
the
circle
that
had
formed
round
the
speaker
and
count
ilya
in
a
military
uniform
of
was
sauntering
with
a
pleasant
smile
among
the
with
all
of
whom
he
was
he
too
approached
that
group
and
listened
with
a
kindly
smile
and
nods
of
as
he
always
to
what
the
speaker
was
the
retired
naval
man
was
speaking
very
as
was
evident
from
the
expression
on
the
faces
of
the
listeners
and
from
the
fact
that
some
people
pierre
knew
as
the
meekest
and
quietest
of
men
walked
away
disapprovingly
or
expressed
disagreement
with
pierre
pushed
his
way
into
the
middle
of
the
and
convinced
himself
that
the
man
was
indeed
a
but
of
views
quite
different
from
his
the
naval
officer
spoke
in
a
particularly
and
aristocratic
baritone
pleasantly
swallowing
his
and
generally
slurring
his
the
voice
of
a
man
calling
out
to
his
bwing

it
was
indicative
of
dissipation
and
the
exercise

all
that

blandly
and
nodded

and
the
was
the
way
he
referred
to
the
only
say
the
word
and
all
die
added
the
orator
with
count
mouth
watered
with
pleasure
and
he
nudged
but
pierre
wanted
to
speak
he
pushed
feeling
but
not
yet
sure
what
stirred
him
or
what
he
would
scarcely
had
he
opened
his
mouth
when
one
of
the
a
man
without
a
tooth
in
his
with
a
shrewd
though
angry
standing
near
the
first
interrupted
evidently
accustomed
to
managing
debates
and
to
maintaining
an
he
began
in
low
but
distinct
said
mumbling
with
his
toothless
we
have
been
summoned
here
not
to
discuss
whether
best
for
the
empire
at
the
present
moment
to
adopt
conscription
or
to
call
out
the
we
have
been
summoned
to
reply
to
the
appeal
with
which
our
sovereign
the
emperor
has
honored
but
to
judge
what
is
or
the
can
leave
to
the
supreme
pierre
suddenly
saw
an
outlet
for
his
he
hardened
his
heart
against
the
senator
who
was
introducing
this
set
and
narrow
attitude
into
the
deliberations
of
the
pierre
stepped
forward
and
interrupted
he
himself
did
not
yet
know
what
he
would
but
he
began
to
speak
occasionally
lapsing
into
french
or
expressing
himself
in
bookish
your
he
was
well
acquainted
with
the
but
thought
it
necessary
on
this
occasion
to
address
him
i
agree
with
the
he
wished
to
tres
honorable
very
honorable
the
whom
i
have
not
the
honor
of
i
suppose
that
the
nobility
have
been
summoned
not
merely
to
express
their
sympathy
and
enthusiasm
but
also
to
consider
the
means
by
which
we
can
assist
our
i
he
went
warming
to
his
the
emperor
himself
would
not
be
satisfied
to
find
in
us
merely
owners
of
serfs
whom
we
are
willing
to
devote
to
his
and
chair
a
canon
we
are
ready
to
make
of
not
to
obtain
from
us
any
for
many
persons
withdrew
from
the
noticing
the
sarcastic
smile
and
the
freedom
of
only
count
rostov
was
pleased
with
them
as
he
had
been
pleased
with
those
of
the
naval
the
and
in
general
with
whatever
speech
he
had
last
think
that
before
discussing
these
pierre
should
ask
the
respectfully
ask
his
let
us
know
the
number
of
our
troops
and
the
position
in
which
our
army
and
our
forces
now
and
but
scarcely
had
pierre
uttered
these
words
before
he
was
attacked
from
three
the
most
vigorous
attack
came
from
an
old
a
boston
player
who
had
always
been
well
disposed
toward
stepan
stepanovich
adraksin
was
in
and
whether
as
a
result
of
the
uniform
or
from
some
other
cause
pierre
saw
before
him
quite
a
different
with
a
sudden
expression
of
malevolence
on
his
aged
adraksin
shouted
at
the
first
i
tell
you
we
have
no
right
to
question
the
emperor
about
and
if
the
russian
nobility
had
that
the
emperor
could
not
answer
such
a
the
troops
are
moved
according
to
the
movements
and
the
number
of
men
increases
and
another
that
of
a
nobleman
of
medium
height
and
about
forty
years
of
whom
pierre
had
formerly
met
at
the
and
knew
as
a
bad
and
also
transformed
by
his
came
up
to
interrupted
and
this
is
not
a
time
for
he
for
there
is
war
in
the
enemy
is
advancing
to
destroy
to
desecrate
the
tombs
of
our
to
carry
off
our
wives
and
the
nobleman
smote
his
will
all
every
one
of
us
will
for
our
father
the
he
rolling
his
bloodshot
several
approving
voices
were
heard
in
the
are
russians
and
will
not
grudge
our
blood
in
defense
of
our
the
and
the
we
must
cease
raving
if
we
are
sons
of
our
we
will
show
europe
how
russia
rises
to
the
defense
of
pierre
wished
to
but
could
not
get
in
a
he
felt
that
his
apart
from
what
meaning
they
were
less
audible
than
the
sound
of
his
count
rostov
at
the
back
of
the
crowd
was
expressing
several
briskly
turning
a
shoulder
to
the
orator
at
the
end
of
a
quite
just
pierre
wished
to
say
that
he
was
ready
to
sacrifice
his
his
or
only
one
ought
to
know
the
state
of
affairs
in
order
to
be
able
to
improve
but
he
was
unable
to
many
voices
shouted
and
talked
at
the
same
so
that
count
rostov
had
not
time
to
signify
his
approval
of
them
and
the
group
and
then
moved
with
a
hum
of
talk
into
the
largest
hall
and
to
the
big
not
only
was
attempt
to
speak
but
he
was
rudely
pushed
and
people
turned
away
from
him
as
from
a
common
this
happened
not
because
they
were
displeased
by
the
substance
of
his
which
had
even
been
forgotten
after
the
many
subsequent
but
to
animate
it
the
crowd
needed
a
tangible
object
to
love
and
a
tangible
object
to
pierre
became
the
many
other
orators
spoke
after
the
excited
and
all
in
the
same
many
spoke
eloquently
and
with
the
editor
of
the
russian
who
was
recognized
of
were
heard
in
the
said
that
must
be
repulsed
by
and
that
he
had
seen
a
child
smiling
at
lightning
flashes
and
but
will
not
be
that
at
was
repeated
approvingly
in
the
back
rows
of
the
the
crowd
drew
up
to
the
large
at
which
sat
or
bald
uniformed
and
besashed
almost
all
of
whom
pierre
had
seen
in
their
own
homes
with
their
or
playing

at
the
with
an
incessant
hum
of
voices
the
crowd
advanced
to
the
pressed
by
the
throng
against
the
high
backs
of
the
the
orators
spoke
one
after
another
and
sometimes
two
those
standing
behind
noticed
what
a
speaker
omitted
to
say
and
hastened
to
supply
others
in
that
heat
and
crush
racked
their
brains
to
find
some
thought
and
hastened
to
utter
the
old
whom
pierre
sat
and
turned
to
look
first
at
one
and
then
at
and
their
faces
for
the
most
part
only
expressed
the
fact
that
they
found
it
very
felt
and
the
general
desire
to
show
that
they
were
ready
to
go
to
all
found
expression
in
the
tones
and
looks
more
than
in
the
substance
of
the
him
he
did
not
renounce
his
but
felt
himself
in
some
way
to
blame
and
wished
to
justify
only
said
that
it
would
be
more
to
the
purpose
to
make
sacrifices
when
we
know
what
is
said

to
be
heard
above
the
other
one
of
the
old
men
nearest
to
him
looked
but
his
attention
was
immediately
diverted
by
an
exclamation

at

than
after

preceding
noise
the
sound
of
their
old
voices
saying
one
after

for

of
that
and
so
on

even
a
mournful

was
told
to
write
down

that

their

made
a
scraping
noise
as
the
gentlemen
who
had
conferred
rose
with
apparent
and
began
walking
up
and
arm
in
to
stretch
their
legs
and
converse
in
the
a
sudden
cry
resounded
through
the
halls
and
the
whole
throng
hurried
to
the
the
emperor
entered
the
hall
through
a
broad
path
between
two
lines
of
every
face
expressed
pierre
stood
rather
far
off
and
could
not
hear
all
that
the
emperor
from
what
he
did
hear
he
understood
that
the
emperor
spoke
of
the
danger
threatening
the
empire
and
of
the
hopes
he
placed
on
the
moscow
he
was
answered
by
a
voice
which
informed
him
of
the
resolution
just
arrived
said
the
emperor
with
a
quivering
there
was
a
rustling
among
the
crowd
and
it
again
so
that
pierre
distinctly
heard
the
pleasantly
human
voice
of
the
emperor
saying
with
never
doubted
the
devotion
of
the
russian
but
today
it
has
surpassed
my
i
thank
you
in
the
name
of
the
let
us

most
the
emperor
ceased
the
crowd
began
pressing
round
and
rapturous
exclamations
were
heard
from
all
most
a
royal
said
count
with
a
he
stood
at
the
though
he
had
heard
hardly
understood
everything
in
his
own
from
the
hall
of
the
nobility
the
emperor
went
to
that
of
the
there
he
remained
about
ten
pierre
was
among
those
who
saw
him
come
out
from
the
hall
with
tears
of
emotion
in
his
as
became
known
he
had
scarcely
begun
to
address
the
merchants
before
tears
gushed
from
his
eyes
and
he
concluded
in
a
trembling
when
pierre
saw
the
emperor
he
was
coming
out
accompanied
by
two
one
of
whom
pierre
a
fat
the
other
was
the
a
man
with
a
thin
sallow
face
and
narrow
both
were
tears
filled
the
thin
and
the
fat
otkupshchik
sobbed
outright
like
a
child
and
kept
lives
and
your
one
feeling
at
the
moment
was
a
desire
to
show
that
he
was
ready
to
go
all
lengths
and
was
prepared
to
sacrifice
he
now
felt
ashamed
of
his
speech
with
its
constitutional
tendency
and
sought
an
opportunity
of
effacing
having
heard
that
count
mamonov
was
furnishing
a
bezukhov
at
once
informed
rostopchin
that
he
would
give
a
thousand
men
and
their
old
rostov
could
not
tell
his
wife
of
what
had
passed
without
and
at
once
consented
to
request
and
went
himself
to
enter
his
next
day
the
emperor
left
the
assembled
nobles
all
took
off
their
uniforms
and
settled
down
again
in
their
homes
and
and
not
without
some
groans
gave
orders
to
their
stewards
about
the
feeling
amazed
themselves
at
what
they
had

i
napoleon
began
the
war
with
russia
because
he
could
not
resist
going
to
could
not
help
having
his
head
turned
by
the
homage
he
could
not
help
donning
a
polish
uniform
and
yielding
to
the
stimulating
influence
of
a
june
and
could
not
refrain
from
bursts
of
anger
in
the
presence
of
kurakin
and
then
of
alexander
refused
negotiations
because
he
felt
himself
to
be

barclay

tried
to

in
the
best
because
he
wished
to
fulfill
his
duty
and
earn
fame
as
a
great
rostov
charged
the
french
because
he
could
not
restrain
his
wish
for
a
gallop
across
a
level
and
in
the
same
way
the
innumerable
people
who
took
part
in
the
war
acted
in
accord
with
their
personal
and
they
were
moved
by
fear
or
rejoiced
or
were
imagining
that
they
knew
what
they
were
doing
and
did
it
of
their
own
free
but
they
all
were
involuntary
tools
of
carrying
on
a
work
concealed
from
them
but
comprehensible
to
such
is
the
inevitable
fate
of
men
of
and
the
higher
they
stand
in
the
social
hierarchy
the
less
are
they
the
actors
of
1812
have
long
since
left
the
their
personal
interests
have
vanished
leaving
no
and
nothing
remains
of
that
time
but
its
historic
providence
compelled
all
these
striving
to
attain
personal
to
further
the
accomplishment
of
a
stupendous
result
no
one
of
them
at
all
nor
nor
still
less
any
of
those
who
did
the
actual
the
cause
of
the
destruction
of
the
french
army
in
1812
is
clear
to
us
no
one
will
deny
that
that
cause
on
the
one
its
advance
into
the
heart
of
russia
late
in
the
season
without
any
preparation
for
a
winter
campaign
on
the
the
character
given
to
the
war
by
the
burning
of
russian
towns
and
the
hatred
of
the
foe
this
aroused
among
the
russian
but
no
one
at
the
time
foresaw
now
seems
so
that
this
was
the
only
way
an
army
of
eight
hundred
thousand
best
in
the
world
and
led
by
the
best
be
destroyed
in
conflict
with
a
raw
army
of
half
its
numerical
and
led
by
inexperienced
commanders
as
the
russian
army
not
only
did
no
one
see
but
on
the
russian
side
every
effort
was
made
to
hinder
the
only
thing
that
could
save
while
on
the
french
despite
experience
and
military
every
effort
was
directed
to
pushing
on
to
moscow
at
the
end
of
the
that
to
doing
the
very
thing
that
was
bound
to
lead
to
in
historical
works
on
the
year
1812
french
writers
are
very
fond
of
saying
that
napoleon
felt
the
danger
of
extending
his
that
he
sought
a
battle
and
that
his
marshals
advised
him
to
stop
at
and
of
making
similar
statements
to
show
that
the
danger
of
the
campaign
was
even
then
russian
authors
are
still
fonder
of
telling
us
that
from
the
commencement
of
the
campaign
a
scythian
war
plan
was
adopted
to
lure
napoleon
into
the
depths
of
and
this
plan
some
of
them
attribute
to
others
to
a
certain
others
to
and
others
again
to
alexander
to
and
letters
which
contain
hints
of
such
a
line
of
but
all
these
hints
at
what
both
from
the
french
side
and
the
are
advanced
only
because
they
fit
in
with
the
had
that
event
not
occurred
these
hints
would
have
been
as
we
have
forgotten
the
thousands
and
millions
of
hints
and
expectations
to
the
contrary
which
were
current
then
but
have
now
been
forgotten
because
the
event
falsified
there
are
always
so
many
conjectures
as
to
the
issue
of
any
event
that
however
it
may
end
there
will
always
be
people
to
said
then
that
it
would
be
quite
forgetting
that
amid
their
innumerable
conjectures
many
were
to
quite
the
contrary
conjectures
as
to
awareness
of
the
danger
of
extending
his
and
the
russian
as
to
luring
the
enemy
into
the
depths
of
are
evidently
of
that
and
only
by
much
straining
can
historians
attribute
such
conceptions
to
napoleon
and
his
or
such
plans
to
the
russian
all
the
facts
are
in
flat
contradiction
to
such
during
the
whole
period
of
the
war
not
only
was
there
no
wish
on
the
russian
side
to
draw
the
french
into
the
heart
of
the
but
from
their
first
entry
into
russia
everything
was
done
to
stop
and
not
only
was
napoleon
not
afraid
to
extend
his
but
he
welcomed
every
step
forward
as
a
triumph
and
did
not
seek
battle
as
eagerly
as
in
former
but
very
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
war
our
armies
were
and
our
sole
aim
was
to
unite
though
uniting
the
armies
was
no
advantage
if
we
meant
to
retire
and
lure
the
enemy
into
the
depths
of
the
our
emperor
joined
the
army
to
encourage
it
to
defend
every
inch
of
russian
soil
and
not
to
the
enormous
drissa
camp
was
formed
on
and
there
was
no
intention
of
retiring
the
emperor
reproached
the
commanders
in
chief
for
every
step
they
he
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
letting
the
enemy
even
reach
still
less
could
he
contemplate
the
burning
of
and
when
our
armies
did
unite
he
was
displeased
that
smolensk
was
abandoned
and
burned
without
a
general
engagement
having
been
fought
under
its
so
thought
the
and
the
russian
commanders
and
people
were
still
more
provoked
at
the
thought
that
our
forces
were
retreating
into
the
depths
of
the
napoleon
having
cut
our
armies
apart
advanced
far
into
the
country
and
missed
several
chances
of
forcing
an
in
august
he
was
at
smolensk
and
thought
only
of
how
to
advance
though
as
we
now
see
that
advance
was
evidently
ruinous
to
the
facts
clearly
show
that
napoleon
did
not
foresee
the
danger
of
the
advance
on
nor
did
alexander
and
the
russian
commanders
then
think
of
luring
napoleon
but
quite
the
the
luring
of
napoleon
into
the
depths
of
the
country
was
not
the
result
of
any
for
no
one
believed
it
to
be
it
resulted
from
a
most
complex
interplay
of
and
wishes
among
those
who
took
part
in
the
war
and
had
no
perception
whatever
of
the
or
of
the
one
way
of
saving
everything
came
about
the
armies
were
divided
at
the
commencement
of
the
we
tried
to
unite
with
the
evident
intention
of
giving
battle
and
checking
the
and
by
this
effort
to
unite
them
while
avoiding
battle
with
a
much
stronger
and
necessarily
withdrawing
the
armies
at
an
acute
led
the
french
on
to
but
we
withdrew
at
an
acute
angle
not
only
because
the
french
advanced
between
our
two
the
angle
became
still
more
acute
and
we
withdrew
still
because
barclay
de
tolly
was
an
unpopular
foreigner
disliked
by
bagration
would
come
under
his
and
in
command
of
the
second
to
postpone
joining
up
and
coming
under
command
as
long
as
he
bagration
was
slow
in
effecting
the
that
was
the
chief
aim
of
all
at
as
he
he
exposed
his
army
to
danger
on
this
and
it
was
best
for
him
to
retire
more
to
the
left
and
more
to
the
worrying
the
enemy
from
flank
and
rear
and
securing
from
the
ukraine
recruits
for
his
and
it
looks
as
if
he
planned
this
in
order
not
to
come
under
the
command
of
the
detested
foreigner
whose
rank
was
inferior
to
his
the
emperor
was
with
the
army
to
encourage
but
his
presence
and
ignorance
of
what
steps
to
and
the
enormous
number
of
advisers
and
destroyed
the
first
energy
and
it
the
intention
was
to
make
a
stand
at
the
drissa
but
aiming
at
becoming
unexpectedly
employed
his
energy
to
influence
and
whole
plan
was
abandoned
and
the
command
entrusted
to
but
as
barclay
did
not
inspire
confidence
his
power
was
the
armies
were
there
was
no
unity
of
and
barclay
was
but
from
this
and
the
unpopularity
of
the
foreign
there
resulted
on
the
one
hand
indecision
and
the
avoidance
of
a
battle
we
could
not
have
refrained
from
had
the
armies
been
united
and
had
someone
instead
of
been
in
and
on
the
other
an
indignation
against
the
foreigners
and
an
increase
in
patriotic
at
last
the
emperor
left
the
and
as
the
most
convenient
and
indeed
the
only
pretext
for
his
departure
it
was
decided
that
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
inspire
the
people
in
the
capitals
and
arouse
the
nation
in
general
to
a
patriotic
and
by
this
visit
of
the
emperor
to
moscow
the
strength
of
the
russian
army
was
he
left
in
order
not
to
obstruct
the
undivided
control
of
the
and
hoping
that
more
decisive
action
would
then
be
but
the
command
of
the
armies
became
still
more
confused
and
the
and
a
swarm
of
adjutants
general
remained
with
the
army
to
keep
the
under
observation
and
arouse
his
and
feeling
less
free
than
ever
under
the
observation
of
all
these
of

still
more
cautious
of
undertaking
any
decisive
action
and
avoided
giving
barclay

at
treachery
and
demanded

the
others
of

group

up
so
much
trouble

of
sending
papers
to

to

and
plunged
into
an
open
struggle
with

last
much
as

disliked

drove
up
in
a
carriage
to

house

by

his
sash
and
came
out
to
meet
and
report
to
his

despite
his
seniority

full

there

preparations
were
made
to
fight

french
before
a

to

as
unsuitable

every
point
of

battleground
he
had
not

disputes
and
intrigues
were
going
on
about
the
future
field
of

while
we
were
looking
for
the
lost
touch
with

stumbled
upon
division
and
reached

walls
of

necessary
to
fight
an
unexpected
battle
at
smolensk
to
save
our
lines
of
the
battle

fought
and
thousands
were
killed
on
both
smolensk

abandoned
contrary
to

wishes
of

and
of

smolensk
was

to

thinking

of
their
own
losses
but
kindling
hatred
of
the
napoleon
advanced
farther
and
we
thus
arriving
at
the
very
result
which
caused
his
chapter
ii
the
day
after
his
son
had
prince
nicholas
sent
for
princess
mary
to
come
to
his
are
you
satisfied
said
made
me
quarrel
with
my
are
all
you
it
hurts
it
old
and
weak
and
this
is
what
you
well
gloat
over
gloat
over
after
that
princess
mary
did
not
see
her
father
for
a
whole
he
was
ill
and
did
not
leave
his
princess
mary
noticed
to
her
surprise
that
during
this
illness
the
old
prince
not
only
excluded
her
from
his
but
did
not
admit
mademoiselle
bourienne
tikhon
alone
attended
at
the
end
of
the
week
the
prince
reappeared
and
resumed
his
former
way
of
devoting
himself
with
special
activity
to
building
operations
and
the
arrangement
of
the
gardens
and
completely
breaking
off
his
relations
with
mademoiselle
his
looks
and
cold
tone
to
his
daughter
seemed
to
you
you
plotted
against
you
lied
to
prince
andrew
about
my
relations
with
that
frenchwoman
and
made
me
quarrel
with
but
you
see
i
need
neither
her
nor
princess
mary
spent
half
of
every
day
with
little
watching
his
teaching
him
russian
and
music
and
talking
to
the
rest
of
the
day
she
spent
over
her
with
her
old
or
with
who
sometimes
came
by
the
back
door
to
see
of
the
war
princess
mary
thought
as
women
do
think
about
she
feared
for
her
brother
who
was
in
was
horrified
by
and
amazed
at
the
strange
cruelty
that
impels
men
to
kill
one
but
she
did
not
understand
the
significance
of
this
which
seemed
to
her
like
all
previous
she
did
not
realize
the
significance
of
this
though
dessalles
with
whom
she
constantly
conversed
was
passionately
interested
in
its
progress
and
tried
to
explain
his
own
conception
of
it
to
and
though
the
who
came
to
see
her
in
their
own
the
rumors
current
among
the
people
of
an
invasion
by
and
though
julie
princess
who
had
resumed
correspondence
with
wrote
patriotic
letters
from
write
you
in
my
good
wrote
julie
in
her
frenchified
i
have
a
detestation
for
all
the
and
the
same
for
their
language
which
i
cannot
support
to
hear
we
in
moscow
are
elated
by
enthusiasm
for
our
adored
poor
husband
is
enduring
pains
and
hunger
in
jewish
but
the
news
which
i
have
inspires
me
yet
heard
probably
of
the
heroic
exploit
of
embracing
his
two
sons
and
will
perish
with
them
but
we
will
not
be
and
truly
though
the
enemy
was
twice
stronger
than
we
were
we
pass
the
time
as
we
but
in
war
as
in
the
princesses
aline
and
sophie
sit
whole
days
with
and
unhappy
widows
of
live
make
beautiful
conversations
over
our
only
my
are
and
so
the
chief
reason
princess
mary
did
not
realize
the
full
significance
of
this
war
was
that
the
old
prince
never
spoke
of
did
not
recognize
and
laughed
at
dessalles
when
he
mentioned
it
at
the
tone
was
so
calm
and
confident
that
princess
mary
unhesitatingly
believed
all
that
july
the
old
prince
was
exceedingly
active
and
even
he
planned
another
garden
and
began
a
new
building
for
the
domestic
the
only
thing
that
made
princess
mary
anxious
about
him
was
that
he
slept
very
little
instead
of
sleeping
in
his
study
as
changed
his
sleeping
place
every
one
day
he
would
order
his
camp
bed
to
be
set
up
in
the
glass
another
day
he
remained
on
the
couch
or
on
the
lounge
chair
in
the
drawing
room
and
dozed
there
without
of
mademoiselle
serf
boy
read
to
then
again
he
would
spend
a
night
in
the
dining
on
august
a
second
letter
was
received
from
prince
in
his
first
letter
which
came
soon
after
he
had
left
prince
andrew
had
dutifully
asked
his
forgiveness
for
what
he
had
allowed
himself
to
say
and
begged
to
be
restored
to
his
to
this
letter
the
old
prince
had
replied
and
from
that
time
had
kept
the
frenchwoman
at
a
prince
second
written
near
vitebsk
after
the
french
had
occupied
that
gave
a
brief
account
of
the
whole
enclosed
for
them
a
plan
he
had
drawn
and
forecasts
as
to
the
further
progress
of
the
in
this
letter
prince
andrew
pointed
out
to
his
father
the
danger
of
staying
at
bald
so
near
the
theater
of
war
and
on
the
direct
line
of
and
advised
him
to
move
to
at
dinner
that
on
mentioning
that
the
french
were
said
to
have
already
entered
the
old
prince
remembered
his
was
a
letter
from
prince
andrew
he
said
to
princess

she
replied
in
a
frightened
she
could
not
have
read
the
letter
as
she
did
not
even
know
it
had
writes
about
this
said
the
with
the
ironic
smile
that
had
become
habitual
to
him
in
speaking
of
the
present
must
be
very
said

in
a
position

went
to

as
soon
as
he
had
left
the
room
the
old

uneasily
threw
down
his
napkin
and
went
do
always
make
some

while
he
was
away

even

quick
accompanied
by
michael
bringing
the
letter
and
a
these
he
put
down
beside
letting
anyone
read
them
at
on
moving
to
the
drawing
room
he
handed
the
letter
to
princess
mary
spreading
out
before
him
the
plan
of
the
new
building
and
fixing
his
eyes
upon
told
her
to
read
the
letter
when
she
had
done
so

looked
inquiringly
at
her
he
was
examining

engrossed
in
his

the

in
amazement
at

the
enemy

at

the

that
what
her
father
was
saying
was
the
snow
melts
sink
in
the
polish
only
they
could
fail
to
see
the
prince
evidently
thinking
of
the
campaign
of
1807
which
seemed
to
him
so

have
advanced
into
prussia
then
things
would
have
taken

different

up

the

michael

much
about

in
his
folded
up
his
and
called
in
alpatych
who
had
long
been
the
prince
had
a
list
of
things
to
be
bought
in
smolensk
walking
up
and
down
the
room
past
alpatych
who
stood
by
the
he
gave
his
you
eight
like
this
it
must
be
exactly
like
the
sealing
as
in
michael
he
paced
up
and
down
for
a
while
and
glanced
at
his
hand
to
the
governor
in
person
a
letter
about
the
bolts
for
the
doors
of
the
new
building
were
wanted
and
had
to
be
of
a
special
shape
the
prince
had
himself
and
a
leather
case
had
to
be
ordered
to
keep
the
the
instructions
to
alpatych
took
over
two
hours
and
still
the
prince
did
not
let
him
he
sat
sank
into
closed
his
and
dozed
alpatych
made
a
slight
if
anything
more
is
wanted
send
after
alpatych
went
the
prince
again
went
to
his
glanced
into
fingered
his
closed
the
bureau
and
sat
down
at
the
table
to
write
to
the
it
was
already
late
when
he
rose
after
sealing
the
he
wished
to
but
he
knew
he
would
not
be
able
to
and
that
most
depressing
thoughts
came
to
him
in
so
he
called
tikhon
and
went
through
the
rooms
with
him
to
show
him
where
to
set
up
the
bed
for
that
he
went
about
looking
at
every
every
place
seemed
but
worst
of
all
was
his
customary
couch
in
the
that
couch
was
dreadful
to
probably
because
of
the
oppressive
thoughts
he
had
had
when
lying
it
was
unsatisfactory
but
the
corner
behind
the
piano
in
the
sitting
room
was
better
than
other
he
had
never
slept
there
with
the
help
of
a
footman
tikhon
brought
in
the
bedstead
and
began
putting
it
not
not
cried
the
and
himself
pushed
it
a
few
inches
from
the
corner
and
then
closer
in
at
last
now
thought
the
and
let
tikhon
undress
frowning
with
vexation
at
the
effort
necessary
to
divest
himself
of
his
coat
and
the
prince
sat
down
heavily
on
the
and
appeared
to
be
meditating
as
he
looked
contemptuously
at
his
withered
yellow
he
was
not
but
only
deferring
the
moment
of
making
the
effort
to
lift
those
legs
up
and
turn
over
on
the
how
hard
it
that
this
toil
might
end
and
you
would
release
thought
pressing
his
lips
together
he
made
that
effort
for
the
time
and
lay
but
hardly
had
he
done
so
before
he
felt
the
bed
rocking
backwards
and
forwards
beneath
him
as
if
it
were
breathing
heavily
and
this
happened
to
him
almost
every
he
opened
his
eyes
as
they
were
damn
he
angry
he
knew
not
with
there
was
something
else
very
that
i
was
keeping
till
i
should
be
in
the
i
told
him
about

was
something
in
the
drawing

the
prince
slapped
his
hand
on
the
i

said
something
about

he
had
the
letter
taken
from
his
pocket
and
the
which
stood
a
glass
of
lemonade
and
a
spiral
wax
close
to
the
and
putting
on
his
spectacles
he
began
only
now
in
the
stillness
of
the
reading
it
by
the
faint
light
under
the
green
did
he
grasp
its
meaning
for
a
french
at
in
four
march
they
may
be
at
perhaps
are
already
tikhon
jumped
i
want
he
he
put
the
letter
under
the
candlestick
and
closed
his
and
there
rose
before
him
the
danube
at
bright
the
russian
and
himself

young
general
without
a
wrinkle
on
his
ruddy
vigorous
and
entering
gaily
colored
and
a
burning
sense
of
jealousy
of
agitated
him
now
as
strongly
as
it
had
done
he
recalled
all
the
words
spoken
at
that
first
meeting
with
and
he
saw
before
him
a
rather
stout
the
empress
with
her
smile
and
her
words
at
her
first
gracious
reception
of
and
then
that
same
face
on
the
and
the
encounter
he
had
with
zubov
over
her
coffin
about
his
right
to
kiss
her
to
get
back
to

evening
that
the

gave
his
instructions
to
having
asked
to
see

her
as
the
prince
was
not
very
well
and
was
taking
no
steps
to
secure
his
though
from
prince

it
was
evident
that
to
remain
at
bald
hills
might
be
he
respectfully
advised
her
to
send
a
letter
by
alpatych
to
the
provincial
governor
at
asking
him
to
let
her
know
the
state
of

and
the
extent
of
the
danger

wrote
this
letter
to
the
governor
for
princess
she
signed
and
it
was
given
to
alpatych
with
instructions
to
hand
it
to
the
governor
and
to
come
back
as
quickly
as
possible
if
there
was
having
received
all
his
orders
wearing
a
white
beaver
present
from
the
carrying
a
stick
as
the
prince
went
out
accompanied
by
his
three
roans
stood
ready
harnessed
to
a
small
conveyance
with
a
leather
the
larger
bell
was
muffled
and
the
little
bells
on
the
harness
stuffed
with
the
prince
allowed
no
one
at
bald
hills
to
drive
with
ringing
but
on
a
long
journey
alpatych
liked
to
have
his
senior
a
countinghouse
a
scullery
a
two
old
a
little
the
and
various
domestic
seeing
him
his
daughter
placed
down
cushions
for
him
to
sit
on
and
behind
his
his
old
popped
in
a
small
and
one
of
the
coachmen
helped
him
into
the
said
puffing
and
speaking
rapidly
just
as
the
prince
and
he
climbed
into
the
after
giving
the
clerk
orders
about
the
work
to
be
not
trying
to
imitate
the
prince
lifted
the
hat
from
his
bald
head
and
crossed
himself
three
there
is
come
yakov
for
sake
think
of
cried
his
referring
to
the
rumors
of
war
and
the
muttered
alpatych
to
himself
and
started
on
his
looking
round
at
the
fields
of
yellow
rye
and
the
thickly
growing
and
at
other
quite
black
fields
just
being
plowed
a
second
as
he
went
along
he
looked
with
pleasure
at
the
splendid
crop
of
scrutinized
the
strips
of
ryefield
which
here
and
there
were
already
being
made
his
calculations
as
to
the
sowing
and
the
and
asked
himself
whether
he
had
not
forgotten
any
of
the
having
baited
the
horses
twice
on
the
he
arrived
at
the
town
toward
evening
on
the
fourth
of
alpatych
kept
meeting
and
overtaking
baggage
trains
and
troops
on
the
as
he
approached
smolensk
he
heard
the
sounds
of
distant
but
these
did
not
impress
what
struck
him
most
was
the
sight
of
a
splendid
field
of
oats
in
which
a
camp
had
been
pitched
and
which
was
being
mown
down
by
the
evidently
for
this
fact
impressed
but
in
thinking
about
his
own
business
he
soon
forgot
all
the
interests
of
his
life
for
more
than
thirty
years
had
been
bounded
by
the
will
of
the
and
he
never
went
beyond
that
everything
not
connected
with
the
execution
of
the
orders
did
not
interest
and
did
not
even
exist
for
on
reaching
smolensk
on
the
evening
of
the
fourth
of
august
he
put
up
in
the
gachina
suburb
across
the
at
the
inn
kept
by
where
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
putting

the
last

and
a
round
wearing

his

opened
onto

asked
for
a
samovar
and
for

there
were
many
but
cabs

still
driving

at
their
and

asking
what

and
all
were
trying
to

a
large
number
of

a
traveling

lifting
his

and
proudly
thrusting
his

some
words
to

called
a
stout
official
with
a
cross
hanging
on
his
neck
to
follow
and
vanished
evidently
wishing
to
avoid
the
inquiring
looks
and
questions
addressed
to
alpatych

forward
and
next
time
the
official
came
out

a
little
trap

half

in
the
other
half
brightly
lit
by
the
alpatych

out
of
the
window
and
went
to
the
suddenly
the
strange
sound
of
a
whistling
and
thud
was
followed
by
a
boom
of
cannon
blending
into
a
dull
roar
that
set
the
windows
he
went
out
into
the
two
men

running
past
toward
the
from
different
sides
came
whistling
sounds
and
the
thud
of
cannon
balls
and
bursting
shells
falling
on
the
but
these
sounds
were
hardly
heard
in
comparison
with
the
noise
of
the
firing
outside
the
town
and
attracted
little
attention
from
the
the
town
was
being
bombarded
by
a
hundred
and
thirty
guns
which
napoleon
had
ordered
up
after
four
the
people
did
not
at
once
realize
the
meaning
of
this
at
first
the
noise
of
the
falling
bombs
and
shells
only
aroused
who
till
then
had
not
ceased
wailing
under
the
became
quiet
and
with
the
baby
in
her
arms
went
to
the
listening
to
the
sounds
and
looking
in
silence
at
the
the
cook
and
a
shop
assistant
came
to
the
with

even
the

in

he
saw
some
ten
soldiers
in

talking
loudly
and
filling
their

with
flour
and

so
that

already
burning
itself
the
flames
now
died
down
and
were
lost
in
the
black
now
suddenly
flared
up
again
lighting
up
with
strange
distinctness
the
faces
of
the
people
crowding
at
the
black
figures
flitted
about
before
the
and
through
the
incessant
crackling
of
the
flames
talking

could
be
seeing
that
his
trap
would
not
be

to

got
down
and
turned
into
the
side
street
to
look
at

continually
rushing
backwards
and
forwards

he
saw
two
of
them
and
a

burning
beams
into
another
yard
across

carried

no
such
freshness
even
at

or
when
the
road
passed
through

the
dew
was
imperceptible
on
the
sandy
dust
churned
up
more
than
six
inches
as
soon
as
day
dawned
the
march
the
artillery
and
baggage
wagons
moved
noiselessly
through
the
deep
dust
that
rose
to
the
very
hubs
of
the
and
the
infantry
sank
in
that
hot
dust
that
never
cooled
even
at
some
of
this
dust
was
kneaded
by
the
feet

while
the
rest
rose

hung
like
a
cloud
over
the
settling

worst
of

the
higher
rose
that
cloud
of
and
through
the
screen
of
its
hot
fine
particles
one
could
look
with
naked
eye
at
the
which
showed
like
a
huge
crimson
ball
in
the
unclouded
there
was
no
and
the
men
choked
in
that
motionless
they
marched
with
handkerchiefs
tied
over
their
noses
and
when
they
passed
through
a
village
they
all
rushed
to

wells

fought
for

the
welfare
of
the
men
and
the
necessity
of
receiving
and
giving
engrossed
the
burning
of
smolensk
and
its
abandonment
made
an
epoch
in
his
a
novel
feeling
of
anger
against
the
foe
made
him
forget
his
own
he
was
entirely
devoted
to
the
affairs
of
his
regiment
and
was
considerate
and
kind
to
his
men
and
in
the
regiment
they
called
him
were
proud
of
him
and
loved
but
he
was
kind
and
gentle
only
to
those
of
his
to
timokhin
and
the
quite
new
to
belonging
to
a
different
world
and
who
could
not
know
and
understand
his
as
soon
as
he
came
across
a
former
acquaintance
or
anyone
from
the
he
bristled
up
immediately
and
grew
and
everything
that
reminded
him
of
his
past
was
repugnant
to
and
so
in
his
relations
with
that
former
circle
he
confined
himself
to
trying
to
do
his
duty
and
not
to
be
in
truth
everything
presented
itself
in
a
dark
and
gloomy
light
to
prince
especially
after
the
abandonment
of
smolensk
on
the
sixth
of
august
considered
that
it
could
and
should
have
been
and
after
his
sick
father
had
had
to
flee
to
abandoning
to
pillage
his
dearly
beloved
bald
hills
which
he
had
built
and
but
despite
thanks
to
his
prince
andrew
had
something
to
think
about
entirely
apart
from
general
two
days
previously
he
had
received
news
that
his
and
sister
had
left
for
and
though
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
at
bald
prince
andrew
with
a
characteristic
desire
to
foment
his
own
grief
decided
that
he
must
ride
he
ordered
his
horse
to
be
saddled
leaving
his
regiment
on
the
rode
to
his
estate
where
he
had
been
born
and
spent
his
riding
past
the
pond
where
there
used
always
to
be
dozens
of
women
chattering
as
they
rinsed
their
linen
or
beat
it
with
wooden
prince
andrew
noticed
that
there
was
not
a
soul
about
and
that
the
little
washing
torn
from
its
place
and
half
was
floating
on
its
side
in

called
for
taras

no

having
gone
round
the
corner
of
the
hothouse
to
the
ornamental

saw
that
the
carved
garden
fence
was
broken
and
branches
of
the
plum
trees
had
been
torn
off
with
the
an
old
peasant
whom
prince
andrew
in
his
childhood
had
often
seen

sitting
on

green
garden

pretty
frightened
little
was
afraid
of
looking
at
and
yet
felt
an
irresistible
desire
to
do
a
new
sensation
of
comfort
and
relief
came
over
him
seeing
these
he
realized
the
existence
of
other
human
interests
entirely
aloof
from
his
own
and
just
as
legitimate
as
those
that
occupied
evidently
these
girls
passionately
desired
one
carry
away
and
eat
those
green
plums
without
being
prince
andrew
shared
their
wish
for
the
success
of
their
he
could
not
resist
looking
at
them
once
believing
their
danger
they
sprang
from
their
ambush
chirruping
something
in
their
shrill
little
voices
and
holding
up
their
their
bare
little
sunburned
feet
scampered
merrily
and
quickly
across
the
meadow
prince
andrew
was
somewhat
refreshed
by
having
ridden
off
the
dusty
highroad
along
which
the
troops
were
but
not
far
from
bald
hills
he
again
came
out
on
the
road
and
overtook
his
regiment
at
its
halting
place
by
the
dam
of
a
small
it
was
past
one
the
a
red
ball
through
the
burned
and
scorched
his
back
intolerably
through
his
black
the
dust
always
hung
motionless
above
the
buzz
of
talk
that
came
from
the
resting
there
was
no
as
he
crossed
the
dam
prince
andrew
smelled
the
ooze
and
freshness
of
the
he
longed
to
get
into
that
however
dirty
it
might
and
he
glanced
round
at
the
pool
from
whence
came
sounds
of
shrieks
and
the
green
pond
had
risen
visibly
more
than
a
flooding
the
because
it
was
full
of
the
naked
white
bodies
of
soldiers
with
and
who
were
splashing
about
in
all
this
naked
white
human
laughing
and
floundered
about
in
that
dirty
pool
like
carp
stuffed
into
a
watering
and
the
suggestion
of
merriment
in
that
floundering
mass
rendered
it
specially
one
young
soldier
of
the
third
whom
prince
andrew
knew
and
who
had
a
strap
round
the
calf
of
one
crossed
stepped
back
to
get
a
good
and
plunged
into
the
a
dark
noncommissioned
officer
who
was
always
stood
up
to
his
waist
in
the
water
joyfully
wriggling
his
muscular
figure
and
snorted
with
satisfaction
as
he
poured
the
water
over
his
head
with
hands
blackened
to
the
there
were
sounds
of
men
slapping
one
and
everywhere
on
the
on
the
and
in
the
there
was
muscular
the
with
his
red
little
standing
on
the
dam
wiping
himself
with
a
felt
confused
at
seeing
the
but
made
up
his
mind
to
address
him
very
your
you
like
said
replied
prince
making
a
clear
it
out
for
you
in
a
said
still
ran
off
to
clear
the
men
out
of
the
prince
wants
to
said
many
and
the
men
were
in
such
haste
to
clear
out
that
the
prince
could
hardly
stop
he
decided
that
he
would
rather
wash
himself
with
water
in
the
cannon
he
and
he
looked
at
his
own
naked
body
and
not
from
cold
but
from
a
sense
of
disgust
and
horror
he
did
not
himself
aroused
by
the
sight
of
that
immense
number
of
bodies
splashing
about
in
the
dirty
on
the
seventh
of
august
prince
bagration
wrote
as
follows
from
his
quarters
at
mikhaylovna
on
the
smolensk
dear
count
alexis
was
writing
to
arakcheev
but
knew
that
his
letter
would
be
read
by
the
and
therefore
weighed
every
word
in
it
to
the
best
of
his
i
expect
the
minister
de
has
already
reported
the
abandonment
of
smolensk
to
the
it
is
pitiable
and
and
the
whole
army
is
in
despair
that
this
most
important
place
has
been
wantonly
for
my
begged
him
personally
most
urgently
and
finally
wrote
but
nothing
would
induce
him
to
i
swear
to
you
on
my
honor
that
napoleon
was
in
such
a
fix
as
never
before
and
might
have
lost
half
his
army
but
could
not
have
taken
our
troops
and
are
as
never
with
fifteen
thousand
men
i
held
the
enemy
at
bay
for
hours
and
beat
but
he
would
not
hold
out
even
for
fourteen
it
is
a
stain
on
our
and
as
for
he
it
seems
to
not
to
if
he
reports
that
our
losses
were
it
is
not
perhaps
about
four
not
and
not
even
but
even
were
they
ten
but
the
enemy
has
lost
what
would
it
have
cost
him
to
hold
out
for
another
two
they
would
have
had
to
retire
of
their
own
for
they
had
no
water
for
men
or
he
gave
me
his
word
he
would
not
but
suddenly
sent
instructions
that
he
was
retiring
that
we
cannot
fight
in
this
or
we
may
soon
bring
the
enemy
to
there
is
a
rumor
that
you
are
thinking
of
god
forbid
that
you
should
make
peace
after
all
our
sacrifices
and
such
insane
you
would
set
all
russia
against
you
and
every
one
of
us
would
feel
ashamed
to
wear
the
if
it
has
come
to
must
fight
as
long
as
russia
can
and
as
long
as
there
are
men
able
to
one
man
ought
to
be
in
and
not
your
minister
may
perhaps
be
good
as
a
but
as
a
general
he
is
not
merely
bad
but
yet
to
him
is
entrusted
the
fate
of
our
whole
i
am
really
frantic
with
forgive
my
writing
it
is
clear
that
the
man
who
advocates
the
conclusion
of
a
and
that
the
minister
should
command
the
does
not
love
our
sovereign
and
desires
the
ruin
of
us
so
i
write
you
call
out
the
for
the
minister
is
leading
these
visitors
after
him
to
moscow
in
a
most
masterly
the
whole
army
feels
great
suspicion
of
the
imperial
he
is
said
to
be
more
man
than
and
he
is
always
advising
the
i
am
not
merely
civil
to
him
but
obey
him
like
a
though
i
am
his
this
is
loving
my
benefactor
and
i
only
i
am
sorry
for
the
emperor
that
he
entrusts
our
fine
army
to
such
as
consider
that
on
our
retreat
we
have
lost
by
fatigue
and
left
in
the
hospital
more
than
fifteen
thousand
and
had
we
attacked
this
would
not
have
tell
for
what
will
our
mother
say
to
our
being
so
and
why
are
we
abandoning
our
good
and
gallant
fatherland
to
such
rabble
and
implanting
feelings
of
hatred
and
shame
in
all
our
what
are
we
scared
at
and
of
whom
are
we
i
am
not
to
blame
that
the
minister
is
a
and
has
all
bad
the
whole
army
bewails
it
and
calls
down
curses
upon
chapter
vi
among
the
innumerable
categories
applicable
to
the
phenomena
of
human
life
one
may
discriminate
between
those
in
which
substance
prevails
and
those
in
which
form
to
the
distinguished
from
or
even
moscow
may
allot
petersburg
and
especially
the
life
of
its
that
life
of
the
salons
is
since
the
year
1805
we
had
made
peace
and
had
again
quarreled
with
bonaparte
and
had
made
constitutions
and
unmade
them
but
the
salons
of
anna
pavlovna
and
helene
remained
just
as
they
had
one
seven
and
the
other
five
years
at
anna
they
talked
with
perplexity
of
successes
just
as
before
and
saw
in
them
and
in
the
subservience
shown
to
him
by
the
european
sovereigns
a
malicious
the
sole
object
of
which
was
to
cause
unpleasantness
and
anxiety
to
the
court
circle
of
which
anna
pavlovna
was
the
and
in
which
rumyantsev
himself
honored
with
his
regarding
helene
as
a
remarkably
intelligent
they
talked
with
the
same
ecstasy
in
1812
as
in
1808
of
the
and
the
and
regretted
our
rupture
with
a
rupture
according
to
ought
to
be
promptly
terminated
by
of
since
the
return
from
the
there
had
been
some
excitement
in
these
conflicting
salon
circles
and
some
demonstrations
of
hostility
to
one
but
each
camp
retained
its
own
in
anna
circle
only
those
frenchmen
were
admitted
who
were
rooted
and
patriotic
views
were
expressed
to
the
effect
that
one
ought
not
to
go
to
the
french
theater
and
that
to
maintain
the
french
troupe
was
costing
the
government
as
much
as
a
whole
army
the
progress
of
the
war
was
eagerly
and
only
the
reports
most
flattering
to
our
army
were
in
the
french
circle
of
helene
and
rumyantsev
the
reports
of
the
cruelty
of
the
enemy
and
of
the
war
were
contradicted
and
all
attempts
at
conciliation
were
in
that
circle
they
discountenanced
those
who
advised
hurried
preparations
for
a
removal
to
kazan
of
the
court
and
the
educational
establishments
under
the
patronage
of
the
dowager
in
circle
the
war
in
general
was
regarded
as
a
series
of
formal
demonstrations
which
would
very
soon
end
in
and
the
view
prevailed
expressed
by
now
in
petersburg
was
quite
at
home
in
which
every
clever
man
was
obliged
to
not
by
gunpowder
but
by
those
who
invented
it
would
matters
be
in
that
circle
the
moscow
of
which
had
reached
petersburg
simultaneously
with
the
ridiculed
sarcastically
and
very
though
with
much
anna
circle
on
the
contrary
was
enraptured
by
this
enthusiasm
and
spoke
of
it
as
plutarch
speaks
of
the
deeds
of
the
prince
who
still
occupied
his
former
important
formed
a
connecting
link
between
these
two
he
visited
his
friend
anna
as
well
as
his
and
often
in
his
constant
comings
and
goings
between
the
two
camps
became
confused
and
said
at
what
he
should
have
said
at
anna
and
vice
soon
after
the
return
prince
vasili
in
a
conversation
about
the
war
at
anna
severely
condemned
barclay
de
but
was
undecided
as
to
who
ought
to
be
appointed
one
of
the
usually
spoken
of
as
man
of
great
having
described
how
he
had
that
day
seen
the
newly
chosen
chief
of
the
petersburg
presiding
over
the
enrollment
of
recruits
at
the
cautiously
ventured
to
suggest
that
kutuzov
would
be
the
man
to
satisfy
all
anna
pavlovna
remarked
with
a
melancholy
smile
that
kutuzov
had
done
nothing
but
cause
the
emperor
have
talked
and
talked
at
the
assembly
of
the
prince
vasili
they
did
not
listen
to
i
told
them
his
election
as
chief
of
the
militia
would
not
please
the
they
did
not
listen
to
all
this
mania
for
he
went
who
it
is
all
because
we
want
to
ape
the
foolish
enthusiasm
of
those
prince
vasili
forgetting
for
a
moment
that
though
at
one
had
to
ridicule
the
moscow
at
anna
one
had
to
be
ecstatic
about
but
he
retrieved
his
mistake
at
is
it
suitable
that
count
the
oldest
general
in
should
preside
at
that
he
will
get
nothing
for
his
how
could
they
make
a
man
who
cannot
mount
a
who
drops
asleep
at
a
and
has
the
very
worst
a
good
reputation
he
made
for
himself
at
i
speak
of
his
capacity
as
a
but
at
a
time
like
this
how
they
appoint
a
blind
old
positively
a
fine
idea
to
have
a
blind
he
see
to
play
he
see
at
no
one
replied
to
his
this
was
quite
correct
on
the
of
but
on
the
ninth
of
july
kutuzov
received
the
title
of
this
might
indicate
a
wish
to
get
rid
of
and
therefore
prince
opinion
continued
to
be
correct
though
he
was
not
now
in
any
hurry
to
express
but
on
the
eighth
of
august
a
consisting
of
field
marshal
and
kochubey
met
to
consider
the
progress
of
the
this
committee
came
to
the
conclusion
that
our
failures
were
due
to
a
want
of
unity
in
the
command
and
though
the
members
of
the
committee
were
aware
of
the
dislike
of
after
a
short
deliberation
they
agreed
to
advise
his
appointment
as
commander
in
that
same
day
kutuzov
was
appointed
chief
with
full
powers
over
the
armies
and
over
the
whole
region
occupied
by
on
the
ninth
of
august
prince
vasili
at
anna
again
met
the
of
great
the
latter
was
very
attentive
to
anna
pavlovna
because
he
wanted
to
be
appointed
director
of
one
of
the
educational
establishments
for
young
prince
vasili
entered
the
room
with
the
air
of
a
happy
conqueror
who
has
attained
the
object
of
his
have
you
heard
the
great
prince
kutuzov
is
field
all
dissensions
are
at
an
i
am
so
so
at
last
we
have
a
said
glancing
sternly
and
significantly
round
at
everyone
in
the
drawing
the
of
great
despite
his
desire
to
obtain
the
post
of
could
not
refrain
from
reminding
prince
vasili
of
his
former
though
this
was
impolite
to
prince
vasili
in
anna
drawing
and
also
to
anna
pavlovna
herself
who
had
received
the
news
with
he
could
not
resist
the
they
say
he
is
said
reminding
prince
vasili
of
his
own
he
sees
well
said
prince
vasili
in
a
deep
voice
and
with
a
slight
voice
and
cough
with
which
he
was
wont
to
dispose
of
all
sees
well
he
what
i
am
so
pleased
he
went
that
our
sovereign
has
given
him
full
powers
over
all
the
armies
and
the
whole
no
ever
had
he
is
a
second
he
concluded
with
a
victorious
grant
god
grant
said
anna
the
of
great
who
was
still
a
novice
in
court
wishing
to
flatter
anna
pavlovna
by
defending
her
former
position
on
this
is
said
that
the
emperor
was
reluctant
to
give
kutuzov
those
they
say
he
blushed
like
a
girl
to
whom
joconde
is
when
he
said
to
emperor
and
the
fatherland
award
you
this
the
heart
took
no
part
in
that
said
anna
warmly
rejoined
prince
who
would
not
now
yield
kutuzov
to
in
his
opinion
kutuzov
was
not
only
admirable
but
was
adored
by
said
our
sovereign
appreciated
him
so
highly
grant
only
that
prince
kutuzov
assumes
real
power
and
does
not
allow
anyone
to
put
a
spoke
in
his
observed
anna
understanding
at
once
to
whom
she
prince
vasili
said
in
a
know
for
a
fact
that
kutuzov
made
it
an
absolute
condition
that
the
tsarevich
should
not
be
with
the
do
you
know
what
he
said
to
the
and
prince
vasili
repeated
the
words
supposed
to
have
been
spoken
by
kutuzov
to
the
can
neither
punish
him
if
he
does
wrong
nor
reward
him
if
he
does
a
very
wise
man
is
prince
i
have
known
him
a
long
even
remarked
the
of
great
who
did
not
yet
possess
courtly
his
excellency
made
it
an
express
condition
that
the
sovereign
himself
should
not
be
with
the
as
soon
as
he
said
this
both
prince
vasili
and
anna
pavlovna
turned
away
from
him
and
glanced
sadly
at
one
another
with
a
sigh
at
his
chapter
vii
while
this
was
taking
place
in
petersburg
the
french
had
already
passed
smolensk
and
were
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
to
historian
like
other

his
trying
to
justify
his
hero
says
that
he
was
drawn
to
the
walls
of
moscow
against
his
he
is
as
right
as
other
historians
who
look
for
the
explanation
of
historic
events
in
the
will
of
one
he
is
as
right
as
the
russian
historians
who
maintain
that
napoleon
was
drawn
to
moscow
by
the
skill
of
the
russian
here
besides
the
law
of
which
regards
all
the
past
as
a
preparation
for
events
that
subsequently
the
law
of
reciprocity
comes
confusing
the
whole
a
good
chessplayer
having
lost
a
game
is
sincerely
convinced
that
his
loss
resulted
from
a
mistake
he
made
and
looks
for
that
mistake
in
the
but
forgets
that
at
each
stage
of
the
game
there
were
similar
mistakes
and
that
none
of
his
moves
were
he
only
notices
the
mistake
to
which
he
pays
because
his
opponent
took
advantage
of
how
much
more
complex
than
this
is
the
game
of
which
occurs
under
certain
limits
of
and
where
it
is
not
one
will
that
manipulates
lifeless
but
everything
results
from
innumerable
conflicts
of
various
after
smolensk
napoleon
sought
a
battle
beyond
dorogobuzh
at
and
then
at
but
it
happened
that
owing
to
a
conjunction
of
innumerable
circumstances
the
russians
could
not
give
battle
till
they
reached
seventy

on

nothing

who
have
seen
all
sorts
of

necessary
to

everything
in

and
cunning
are

to
render
any

and
are
keen
at
guessing
their
baser
especially
those
prompted
by
vanity
and
finding
himself
in
the
company
of
whose
identity
he
had
easily
and
surely
lavrushka
was
not
in
the
least
abashed
but
merely
did
his
utmost
to
gain
his
new
he
knew
very
well
that
this
was
but
presence
could
no
more
intimidate
him
than
or
a
sergeant
with

would
have
for
he
had
nothing
that
either
the
sergeant
major
or
napoleon
could
deprive
him
so
he
rattled
telling
all
the
gossip
he
had
heard
among
the
much
of
it
but
when
napoleon
asked
him
whether
the
russians
thought
they
would
beat
bonaparte
or
lavrushka
screwed
up
his
eyes
and
in
this
question
he
saw
subtle
as
men
of
his
type
see
cunning
in
so
he
frowned
and
did
not
answer
like
he
said

yours

three

to

a

will
but
if
god
knows
what
will
napoleon
did
not

he
was
evidently
in
high
good
and
he
ordered
these
words
to
be

noticed
this
and
to
entertain
him
pretending
not
to
know
who
napoleon
know
that
you
have
bonaparte
and
that
he
has
beaten
everybody
in
the
but
we
are
a
different
knowing
why
or
how
this
bit
of
boastful
patriotism
slipped
out
at
the
the
interpreter
translated
these
words
without
the
last
and
bonaparte
young
cossack
made
his
mighty
interlocutor

after
riding
a
few
paces
in

turned
to

and
said
he
wished
to

how

who
had
written

of

the
fact
was
accordingly
conveyed
to
understanding
that
this
was
done
to
perplex
him
and
that
napoleon
expected
him
to
be
to
gratify
his
new
masters
promptly
pretended
to
be
astonished
and
opened
his
eyes
and
assumed
the
expression
he
usually
put
on
when
taken
to
be
soon
as
interpreter
had
says
seized
by

not
utter
another

rode
his

on
the

whose
fame
had
reached
him
across
the
steppes
of
the
all
his
loquacity
was
suddenly
arrested
and
replaced
by
a
naive
and
silent
feeling
of
after
making

a

him
set
free
like
a

restored
to

rode
dreaming

so
appealed
to

restored

to
our

on
the
way
all
that
had
not
taken

but
that
he
meant
to
relate
to
his
what
had
really
taken
place
he
did
not
wish
to
relate
because
it
seemed
to
him
not
worth
he
found
the
inquired
for
the

operating
with

and
by
evening
found
his

just
mounting

viii
princess
mary
was
not
in
moscow
and
out
of
danger
as
prince
andrew
after
the
return
of
alpatych
from
smolensk
the
old
prince
suddenly
seemed
to
awake
as
from
a
he
ordered
the
militiamen
to
be
called
up
from
the
villages
and
and
wrote
a
letter
to
the
chief
informing
him
that
he
had
resolved
to
remain
at
bald
hills
to
the
last
extremity
and
to
defend
leaving
to
the
discretion
to
take
measures
or
not
for
the
defense
of
bald
where
one
of
oldest
generals
would
be
captured
or
and
he
announced
to
his
household
that
he
would
remain
at
bald
but
while
himself
he
gave
instructions
for
the
departure
of
the
princess
and
dessalles
with
the
little
prince
to
bogucharovo
and
thence
to
princess
alarmed
by
her
feverish
and
sleepless
activity
after
his
previous
could
not
bring
herself
to
leave
him
alone
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
ventured
to
disobey
she
refused
to
go
away
and
her
fury
broke
over
her
in
a
terrible
he
repeated
every
injustice
he
had
ever
inflicted
on
trying
to
convict
he
told
her
she
had
worn
him
had
caused
his
quarrel
with
his
had
harbored
nasty
suspicions
of
making
it
the
object
of
her
life
to
poison
his
and
he
drove
her
from
his
study
telling
her
that
if
she
did
not
go
away
it
was
all
the
same
to
he
declared
that
he
did
not
wish
to
remember
her
existence
and
warned
her
not
to
dare
to
let
him
see
the
fact
that
he
did
as
she
had
order
her
to
be
carried
away
by
force
but
only
told
her
not
to
let
him
see
her
cheered
princess
she
knew
it
was
a
proof
that
in
the
depth
of
his
soul
he
was
glad
she
was
remaining
at
home
and
had
not
gone
the
morning
after
little
nicholas
had
the
old
prince
donned
his
full
uniform
and
prepared
to
visit
the
his
caleche
was
already
at
the
princess
mary
saw
him
walk
out
of
the
house
in
his
uniform
wearing
all
his
orders
and
go
down
the
garden
to
review
his
armed
peasants
and
domestic
she
sat
by
the
window
listening
to
his
voice
which
reached
her
from
the
suddenly
several
men
came
running
up
the
avenue
with
frightened
princess
mary
ran
out
to
the
down
the
and
into
the
a
large
crowd
of
militiamen
and
domestics
were
moving
toward
and
in
their
midst
several
men
were
supporting
by
the
armpits
and
dragging
along
a
little
old
man
in
a
uniform
and
she
ran
up
to
him
in
the
play
of
the
sunlight
that
fell
in
small
round
spots
through
the
shade
of
the
could
not
be
sure
what
change
there
was
in
his
all
she
could
see
was
that
his
former
stern
and
determined
expression
had
altered
to
one
of
timidity
and
on
seeing
his
daughter
he
moved
his
helpless
lips
and
made
a
hoarse
it
was
impossible
to
make
out
what
he
he
was
lifted
carried
to
his
and
laid
on
the
very
couch
he
had
so
feared
of
the
who
was
fetched
that
same
bled
him
and
said
that
the
prince
had
had
a
seizure
paralyzing
his
right
it
was
becoming
more
and
more
dangerous
to
remain
at
bald
and
next
day
they
moved
the
prince
to
the
doctor
accompanying
by
the
time
they
reached
dessalles
and
the
little
prince
had
already
left
for
for
three
weeks
the
old
prince
lay
stricken
by
paralysis
in
the
new
house
prince
andrew
had
built
at
ever
in
the
same
getting
neither
better
nor
he
was
unconscious
and
lay
like
a
distorted
he
muttered
his
eyebrows
and
lips
and
it
was
impossible
to
tell
whether
he
understood
what
was
going
on
around
him
or
one
thing
was
he
was
suffering
and
wished
to
say
but
what
it
no
one
could
it
might
be
some
caprice
of
a
sick
and
or
it
might
relate
to
public
or
possibly
to
family
the
doctor
said
this
restlessness
did
not
mean
anything
and
was
due
to
physical
but
princess
mary
thought
he
wished
to
tell
her
and
the
fact
that
her
presence
always
increased
his
restlessness
confirmed
her
he
was
evidently
suffering
both
physically
and
there
was
no
hope
of
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
it
would
not
do
to
let
him
die
on
the
it
not
be
better
if
the
end
did
the
very
princess
mary
sometimes
night
and
hardly
sleeping
at
she
watched
him
terrible
to
often
watched
him
not
with
hope
of
finding
signs
of
improvement
but
wishing
to
find
symptoms
of
the
approach
of
the
strange
as
it
was
to
her
to
acknowledge
this
feeling
in
yet
there
it
and
what
seemed
still
more
terrible
to
her
was
that
since
her
illness
began
even
when
she
stayed
with
him
expecting
something
to
all
the
personal
desires
and
hopes
that
had
been
forgotten
or
sleeping
within
her
had
thoughts
that
had
not
entered
her
mind
for
of
a
life
free
from
the
fear
of
her
and
even
the
possibility
of
love
and
of
family
continually
in
her
imagination
like
temptations
of
the
thrust
them
aside
as
she
questions
continually
recurred
to
her
as
to
how
she
would
order
her
life
after
these
were
temptations
of
the
devil
and
princess
mary
knew
she
knew
that
the
sole
weapon
against
him
was
and
she
tried
to
she
assumed
an
attitude
of
looked
at
the
repeated
the
words
of
a
but
she
could
not
she
felt
that
a
different
world
had
now
taken
possession
of
life
of
a
world
of
strenuous
and
free
quite
opposed
to
the
spiritual
world
in
which
till
now
she
had
been
confined
and
in
which
her
greatest
comfort
had
been
she
could
not
could
not
and
worldly
cares
took
possession
of
it
was
becoming
dangerous
to
remain
in
news
of
the
approach
of
the
french
came
from
all
and
in
one
ten
miles
from
a
homestead
had
been
looted
by
french
the
doctor
insisted
on
the
necessity
of
moving
the
the
provincial
marshal
of
the
nobility
sent
an
official
to
princess
mary
to
persuade
her
to
get
away
as
quickly
as
and
the
head
of
the
rural
police
having
come
to
bogucharovo
urged
the
same
saying
that
the
french
were
only
some
miles
that
french
proclamations
were
circulating
in
the
and
that
if
the
princess
did
not
take
her
father
away
before
the
he
could
not
answer
for
the
the
princess
decided
to
leave
on
the
the
cares
of
preparation
and
giving
for
which
everyone
came
to

her
all
she
spent
the
night
of
the
fourteenth
as
without
in
the
room
next
to
the
one
where
the
prince
several
waking
she
heard
his
groans
and
the
creak
of
his
and
the
steps
of
tikhon
and
the
doctor
when
they
turned
him
several
times
she
listened
at
the
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
his
mutterings
were
louder
than
usual
and
that
they
turned
him
over
she
could
not
sleep
and
several
times
went
to
the
door
and
wishing
to
enter
but
not
deciding
to
do
though
he
did
not
princess
mary
saw
and
knew
how
unpleasant
every
sign
of
anxiety
on
his
account
was
to
she
had
noticed
with
what
dissatisfaction
he
turned
from
the
look
she
sometimes
involuntarily
fixed
on
she
knew
that
her
going
in
during
the
night
at
an
unusual
hour
would
irritate
but
never
had
she
felt
so
grieved
for
him
or
so
much
afraid
of
losing
she
recalled
all
her
life
with
him
and
in
every
word
and
act
of
his
found
an
expression
of
his
love
of
occasionally
amid
these
memories
temptations
of
the
devil
would
surge
into
her
thoughts
of
how
things
would
be
after
his
and
how
her
liberated
life
would
be
but
she
drove
these
thoughts
away
with
toward
morning
he
became
quiet
and
she
fell
she
woke
that
sincerity
which
often
comes
with
waking
showed
her
clearly
what
chiefly
concerned
her
about
her
on
waking
she
listened
to
what
was
going
on
behind
the
door
hearing
him
said
to
herself
with
a
sigh
that
things
were
still
the
what
could
have
what
did
i
i
want
his
she
cried
with
a
feeling
of
loathing
for

said

went
out
to
the

carriages
without

being
packed

at

horrified
by
her
spiritual
baseness
and
trying

her

came
downstairs

beat
so
violently
at
this
news
that
she
grew
pale
and
leaned
against
the
wall
to
keep
from
to
see

to
feel
his
eyes
on
her
now
that
her
whole
soul
was
overflowing
with
those
wicked

a
torment
of
joy

up

straight
before
his
right
eye

and
his
brows
and

he
seemed
altogether
so
and
his
face
seemed
to
have
shriveled
or
his
features
had
grown
princess
mary
went
up
and
kissed
his
his
left

hers
so
that

and
his
brows
and

quivered

looked
at
him
in
dismay
trying
to
guess
what
he
wanted
of
when
she
changed
her
position
so
that
his
left
eye
could
see
her
face
he
calmed
not
taking
his
eyes
off
her
for
some

he
began
to
gazing
timidly
and
imploringly
at

afraid
that
she

all
her
faculties

mary
looked
at
the
comic
efforts
with
which
he
moved
his
tongue

her
drop

eyes
and
with
difficulty
repress
the
sobs
that
rose
to
her

said
repeating
the
same
words
several
she
could
not
understand
but
tried
to
guess
what
he
was
saying
and
inquiringly
repeated
the
words

repeated
several

was
quite
impossible
to

to

with

not

make
out
what
he
had

from
his
look
it
was
clear
that

to
flow
from
his
he
said
and
a
timid
expression
of
doubt
showed
itself
on
his
face
as
he
he
himself
seemed
aware
that
his
demand
was
so
at
least
it
seemed
to
princess
have
a
letter
from
she
he
glanced
at
her
with
timid
is
with
the
at
he
closed
his
eyes
and
remained
silent
a
long
then
as
if
in
answer
to
his
doubts
and
to
confirm
the
fact
that
now
he
understood
and
remembered
he
nodded
his
head
and
reopened
his
he
softly
and
has
destroyed
and
he
began
to
and
again
tears
flowed
from
his
princess
mary
could
no
longer
restrain
herself
and
wept
while
she
gazed
at
his
again
he
closed
his
his
sobs
he
pointed
to
his
and
understanding
wiped
away
the
then
he
again
opened
his
eyes
and
said
something
none
of
them
could
understand
for
a
long
till
at
last
tikhon
understood
and
repeated
princess
mary
had
sought
the
meaning
of
his
words
in
the
mood
in
which
he
had
just
been
she
thought
he
was
speaking
of
or
prince
of
of
his
or
of
his
own
and
so
she
could
not
guess
his
on
your
white
i
like
was
what
he
having
understood
this
princess
mary
sobbed
still
and
the
doctor
taking
her
arm
led
her
out
to
the
soothing
her
and
trying
to
persuade
her
to
prepare
for
her
when
she
had
left
the
room
the
prince
again
began
speaking
about
his
about
the
and
about
the
angrily
twitching
his
brows
and
raising
his
hoarse
and
then
he
had
a
second
and
final
princess
mary
stayed
on
the
the
day
had
it
was
hot
and
she
could
understand
think
of
nothing
and
feel
except
passionate
love
for
her
love
such
as
she
thought
she
had
never
felt
till
that
she
ran
out
sobbing
into
the
garden
and
as
far
as
the
along
the
avenues
of
young
lime
trees
prince
andrew
had
i
wished
for

wanted
it
to

is
no
longer
princess
mary
pacing
the
garden
with
hurried
steps
and
pressing
her
hands
to
her
bosom
which
heaved
with
convulsive
when
she
had
completed
the
tour
of
the
which
brought
her
again
to
the
she
saw
mademoiselle
had
remained
at
bogucharovo
and
did
not
wish
to
leave

her

listened
without

led
him
to
the
offered

and
sat
down
with

went
to
the
door
of
the

doctor
came
out
with
an
agitated
face
and
said
she
could
not

she
returned
to
the
garden
and
sat
down
on
the
grass
at
the
foot
of
the
slope
by
the
where
no
one
could
see
she
did
not
know
how
long
she
had
been
there
when
she
was
aroused
by
the
sound
of
a
footsteps
running
along
the
she
rose
and
saw
dunyasha
her
who
was
evidently
looking
for
and
who
stopped
suddenly
as
if
in
alarm
on
seeing
her
the
said
dunyasha
in
a
breaking
replied
the
princess
not
giving
dunyasha

cried
angrily

him
aside
and

opened
the
door
and
the
bright
daylight
in
that
previously
darkened
room
startled
in
the
room
were
her
nurse
and
other
they
all
drew
back
from
the
making
way
for
he
was
still
lying
on
the
bed
as
but
the
stern
expression
of
his
quiet
face
made
princess
mary
stop
short
on
the
not
she
told
herself
and
approached
and
repressing
the
terror
that
seized
she
pressed
her
lips
to
his
but
she
stepped
back
all
the
force
of
the
tenderness
she
had
been
feeling
for
him
vanished
instantly
and
was
replaced
by
a
feeling
of
horror
at
what
lay
there
before
he
is
no
he
is
but
here
where
he
was
is
something
unfamiliar
and
some
and
repellent
and
hiding
her
face
in
her
princess
mary
sank
into
the
arms
of
the
who
held
her
in
the
presence
of
tikhon
and
the
doctor
the
women
washed
what
had
been

tied
his
head
up
with
a
handkerchief
that
the
mouth
should
not
stiffen
while
and
with
another
handkerchief
tied
together
the
legs
that
were
already
spreading
then
they
dressed
him
in
uniform
with
his
decorations
and
placed
his
shriveled
little
body
on
a
heaven
only
knows
who
arranged
all
this
and
but
it
all
got
done
as
if
of
its
own
toward
night
candles
were
burning
round
his
a
pall
was
spread
over

strewn
with
sprays
of

tucked
in
under

in

corner
of
the
room
sat
a
chanter
reading
the

the
inmates
of

crowded
into

chapter
ix
until
prince
andrew
settled
in
bogucharovo
its
owners
had
always
been
and
its
peasants
were
of
quite
a
different
character
from
those
of
bald
they
differed
from
them
in
and
they
were
called
steppe
the
old
prince
used
to
approve
of
them
for
their
endurance
at
work
when
they
came
to
bald
hills
to
help
with
the
harvest
or
to
dig
and
but
he
disliked
them
for
their
prince
last
stay
at
when
he
introduced
hospitals
and
schools
and
reduced
the
quitrent
the
peasants
had
to
had
not
softened
their
disposition
but
had
on
the
contrary
strengthened
in
them
the
traits
of
character
the
old
prince
called
various
obscure
rumors
were
always
current
among
at
one
time
a
rumor
that
they
would
all
be
enrolled
as
at
another
of
a
new
religion
to
which
they
were
all
to
be
then
of
some
proclamation
of
the
and
of
an
oath
to
the
tsar
paul
in
1797
connection
with
which
it
was
rumored
that
freedom
had
been
granted
them
but
the
landowners
had
stopped
then
of
peter
return
to
the
throne
in
seven
when
everything
would
be
made
free
and
so
that
there
would
be
no
rumors
of
the
war
with
bonaparte
and
his
invasion
were
connected
in
their
minds
with
the
same
sort
of
vague
notions
of
the
end
of
the
and
in
the
vicinity
of
bogucharovo
were
large
villages
belonging
to
the
crown
or
to
owners
whose
serfs
paid
quitrent
and
could
work
where
they
there
were
very
few
resident
landlords
in
the
neighborhood
and
also
very
few
domestic
or
literate
and
in
the
lives
of
the
peasantry
of
those
parts
the
mysterious
undercurrents
in
the
life
of
the
russian
the
causes
and
meaning
of
which
are
so
baffling
to
were
more
clearly
and
strongly
noticeable
than
among
one
which
had
occurred
some
twenty
years
was
a
movement
among
the
peasants
to
emigrate
to
some
unknown
hundreds
of
among
them
the
bogucharovo
suddenly
began
selling
their
cattle
and
moving
in
whole
families
toward
the
as
birds
migrate
to
somewhere
beyond
the
so
these
men
with
their
wives
and
children
streamed
to
the
to
parts
where
none
of
them
had
ever
they
set
off
in
bought
their
freedom
one
by
one
or
ran
and
drove
or
walked
toward
the
many
of
them
were
some
sent
to
many
died
of
cold
and
hunger
on
the
many
returned
of
their
own
and
the
movement
died
down
of
itself
just
as
it
had
sprung
without
apparent
but
such
undercurrents
still
existed
among
the
people
and
gathered
new
forces
ready
to
manifest
themselves
just
as
and
at
the
same
time
and
now
in
to
anyone
living
in
close
touch
with
these
people
it
was
apparent
that
these
undercurrents
were
acting
strongly
and
nearing
an
who
had
reached
bogucharovo
shortly
before
the
old
noticed
an
agitation
among
the
and
that
contrary
to
what
was
happening
in
the
bald
hills
where
over
a
radius
of
forty
miles
all
the
peasants
were
moving
away
and
leaving
their
villages
to
be
devastated
by
the
the
peasants
in
the
steppe
region
round
bogucharovo
it
was
in
touch
with
the
received
leaflets
from
them
that
passed
from
hand
to
and
did
not
he
learned
from
domestic
serfs
loyal
to
him
that
the
peasant
who
possessed
great
influence
in
the
village
commune
and
had
recently
been
away
driving
a
government
had
returned
with
news
that
the
cossacks
were
destroying
deserted
but
that
the
french
did
not
harm
alpatych
also
knew
that
on
the
previous
day
another
peasant
had
even
brought
from
the
village
of
which
was
occupied
by
the
a
proclamation
by
a
french
general
that
no
harm
would
be
done
to
the
and
if
they
remained
they
would
be
paid
for
anything
taken
from
as
proof
of
this
the
peasant
had
brought
from
visloukhovo
a
hundred
rubles
in
notes
did
not
know
that
they
were
paid
to
him
in
advance
for
more
important
alpatych
learned
that
on
the
morning
of
the
very
day
he
gave
the
village
elder
orders
to
collect
carts
to
move
the
luggage
from
there
had
been
a
village
meeting
at
which
it
had
been
decided
not
to
move
but
to
yet
there
was
no
time
to
on
the
the
day
of
the
old
the
marshal
had
insisted
on
princess
leaving
at
as
it
was
becoming
he
had
told
her
that
after
the
sixteenth
he
could
not
be
responsible
for
what
might
on
the
evening
of
the
day
the
old
prince
died
the
marshal
went
promising
to
return
next
day
for
the
but
this
he
was
unable
to
for
he
received
tidings
that
the
french
had
unexpectedly
and
had
barely
time
to
remove
his
own
family
and
valuables
from
his
for
some
thirty
years
bogucharovo
had
been
managed
by
the
village
whom
the
old
prince
called
by
the
diminutive
dron
was
one
of
those
physically
and
mentally
vigorous
peasants
who
grow
big
beards
as
soon
as
they
are
of
age
and
go
on
unchanged
till
they
are
sixty
or
without
a
gray
hair
or
the
loss
of
a
as
straight
and
strong
at
sixty
as
at
soon
after
the
migration
to
the
in
which
he
had
taken
part
like
the
dron
was
made
village
elder
and
overseer
of
and
had
since
filled
that
post
irreproachably
for
three
the
peasants
feared
him
more
than
they
did
their
the
both
the
old
prince
and
the
and
the
steward
respected
him
and
jestingly
called
him
during
the
whole
time
of
his
service
dron
had
never
been
drunk
or
never
after
sleepless
nights
or
the
hardest
tasks
had
he
shown
the
least
and
though
he
could
not
read
he
had
never
forgotten
a
single
money
account
or
the
number
of
quarters
of
flour
in
any
of
the
endless
cartloads
he
sold
for
the
nor
a
single
shock
of
the
whole
corn
crop
on
any
single
acre
of
the
bogucharovo
arriving
from
the
devastated
bald
hills
sent
for
his
dron
on
the
day
of
the
funeral
and
told
him
to
have
twelve
horses
got
ready
for
the
carriages
and
eighteen
carts
for
the
things
to
be
removed
from
though
the
peasants
paid
alpatych
thought
no
difficulty
would
be
made
about
complying
with
this
for
there
were
two
hundred
and
thirty
households
at
work
in
bogucharovo
and
the
peasants
were
well
to
but
on
hearing
the
order
dron
lowered
his
eyes
and
remained
alpatych
named
certain
peasants
he
from
whom
he
told
him
to
take
the
dron
replied
that
the
horses
of
these
peasants
were
away
alpatych
named
but
they
according
to
had
no
horses
some
horses
were
carting
for
the
others
were
too
and
others
had
died
for
want
of
it
seemed
that
no
horses
could
be
had
even
for
the
much
less
for
the
alpatych
looked
intently
at
dron
and
just
as
dron
was
a
model
village
so
alpatych
had
not
managed
the
estates
for
twenty
years
in
he
was
a
model
possessing
in
the
highest
degree
the
faculty
of
divining
the
needs
and
instincts
of
those
he
dealt
having
glanced
at
dron
he
at
once
understood
that
his
answers
did
not
express
his
personal
views
but
the
general
mood
of
the
bogucharovo
by
which
the
elder
had
already
been
carried
but
he
also
knew
that
who
had
acquired
property
and
was
hated
by
the
must
be
hesitating
between
the
two
the
and
the
he
noticed
this
hesitation
in
look
and
therefore
frowned
and
moved
closer
up
to
just
said
talk
nonsense
to
his
excellency
prince
andrew
himself
gave
me
orders
to
move
all
the
people
away
and
not
leave
them
with
the
and
there
is
an
order
from
the
tsar
about
it
anyone
who
stays
is
a
traitor
to
the
do
you
dron
answered
without
lifting
his
alpatych
was
not
satisfied
with
this
it
will
turn
out
he
shaking
his
power
is
in
your
dron
rejoined
drop
alpatych
withdrawing
his
hand
from
his
bosom
and
solemnly
pointing
to
the
floor
at
can
see
through
you
and
three
yards
into
the
ground
under
he
gazing
at
the
floor
in
front
of
dron
was
glanced
furtively
at
alpatych
and
again
lowered
his
drop
this
nonsense
and
tell
the
people
to
get
ready
to
leave
their
homes
and
go
to
moscow
and
to
get
carts
ready
for
tomorrow
morning
for
the
and
go
to
any
meeting
do
you
dron
suddenly
fell
on
his
discharge
take
the
keys
from
me
and
discharge
for
cried
alpatych
see
through
you
and
three
yards
under
he
knowing
that
his
skill
in
his
knowledge
of
the
right
time
to
sow
the
and
the
fact
that
he
had
been
able
to
retain
the
old
favor
for
twenty
years
had
long
since
gained
him
the
reputation
of
being
a
and
that
the
power
of
seeing
three
yards
under
a
man
is
considered
an
attribute
of
dron
got
up
and
was
about
to
say
but
alpatych
interrupted
is
it
you
have
got
into
your
what
are
you
thinking
am
i
to
do
with
the
said
quite
beside
i
have
already
told
i
dare
said
they
he
asked
beside
yakov
fetched
another
go
to
the
police
and
you
tell
them
and
that
they
must
stop
this
and
the
carts
must
be
got
alpatych
did
not
insist
he
had
managed
people
for
a
long
time
and
knew
that
the
chief
way
to
make
them
obey
is
to
show
no
suspicion
that
they
can
possibly
having
wrung
a
submissive
from
alpatych
contented
himself
with
though
he
not
only
doubted
but
felt
almost
certain
that
without
the
help
of
troops
the
carts
would
not
be
and
so
it
for
when
evening
came
no
carts
had
been
in
the
outside
the
drink
another
meeting
was
being
which
decided
that
the
horses
should
be
driven
out
into
the
woods
and
the
carts
should
not
be
without
saying
anything
of
this
to
the
alpatych
had
his
own
belongings
taken
out
of
the
carts
which
had
arrived
from
bald
hills
and
had
those
horses
got
ready
for
the
meanwhile
he
went
himself
to
the
police
chapter
x
after
her
funeral
princess
mary
shut
herself
up
in
her
room
and
did
not
admit
a
maid
came
to
the
door
to
say
that
alpatych
was
asking
for
orders
about
their
was
before
his
talk
with
princess
mary
raised
herself
on
the
sofa
on
which
she
had
been
lying
and
replied
through
the
closed
door
that
she
did
not
mean
to
go
away
and
begged
to
be
left
in
the
windows
of
the
room
in
which
she
was
lying
looked
she
lay
on
the
sofa
with
her
face
to
the
fingering
the
buttons
of
the
leather
cushion
and
seeing
nothing
but
that
and
her
confused
thoughts
were
centered
on
one
irrevocability
of
death
and
her
own
spiritual
which
she
had
not
but
which
had
shown
itself
during
her
she
wished
to
pray
but
did
not
dare
dared
not
in
her
present
state
of
mind
address
herself
to
she
lay
for
a
long
time
in
that
the
sun
had
reached
the
other
side
of
the
and
its
slanting
rays
shone
into
the
open
lighting
up
the
room
and
part
of
the
morocco
cushion
at
which
princess
mary
was
the
flow
of
her
thoughts
suddenly
unconsciously
she
sat
smoothed
her
got
and
went
to
the
involuntarily
inhaling
the
freshness
of
the
clear
but
windy
you
can
well
enjoy
the
evening
he
is
gone
and
no
one
will
hinder
she
said
to
and
sinking
into
a
chair
she
let
her
head
fall
on
the
window
someone
spoke
her
name
in
a
soft
and
tender
voice
from
the
garden
and
kissed
her
she
looked
it
was
mademoiselle
bourienne
in
a
black
dress
and
she
softly
approached
princess
kissed
and
immediately
began
to
the
princess
looked
up
at
all
their
former
disharmony
and
her
own
jealousy
recurred
to
her
but
she
remembered
too
how
he
had
changed
of
late
toward
mademoiselle
bourienne
and
could
not
bear
to
see
thereby
showing
how
unjust
were
the
reproaches
princess
mary
had
mentally
addressed
to
is
it
for
for
me
who
desired
his
to
condemn
she
princess
mary
vividly
pictured
to
herself
the
position
of
mademoiselle
whom
she
had
of
late
kept
at
a
but
who
yet
was
dependent
on
her
and
living
in
her
she
felt
sorry
for
her
and
held
out
her
hand
with
a
glance
of
gentle
mademoiselle
bourienne
at
once
began
crying
again
and
kissed
that
speaking
of
the
sorrow
and
making
herself
a
partner
in
she
said
her
only
consolation
was
the
fact
that
the
princess
allowed
her
to
share
her
that
all
the
old
misunderstandings
should
sink
into
nothing
but
this
great
that
she
felt
herself
blameless
in
regard
to
and
that
from
saw
her
affection
and
the
princess
heard
not
heeding
her
words
but
occasionally
looking
up
at
her
and
listening
to
the
sound
of
her
position
is
doubly
dear
said
mademoiselle
bourienne
after
a
understand
that
you
could
and
think
of
but
with
my
love
for
you
i
must
do
has
alpatych
been
to
has
he
spoken
to
you
of
going
she
princess
mary
did
not
she
did
not
understand
who
was
to
go
or
where
it
possible
to
plan
or
think
of
anything
is
it
not
all
the
she
and
did
not
chere
said
mademoiselle
we
are
in
surrounded
by
the
it
would
be
dangerous
to
move
if
we
go
we
are
almost
sure
to
be
taken
and
god
princess
mary
looked
at
her
companion
without
understanding
what
she
was
talking
if
anyone
knew
how
little
anything
matters
to
me
she
course
i
would
on
no
account
wish
to
go
away
from
alpatych
did
say
something
about
speak
to
i
can
do
and
want
spoken
to
he
hopes
we
should
be
in
time
to
get
away
but
i
think
it
would
now
be
better
to
stay
said
mademoiselle
you
will
chere
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
soldiers
or
of
riotous
peasants
would
be
mademoiselle
bourienne
took
from
her
reticule
a
proclamation
printed
on
ordinary
russian
of
general
telling
people
not
to
leave
their
homes
and
that
the
french
authorities
would
afford
them
proper
she
handed
this
to
the
think
it
would
be
best
to
appeal
to
that
she
i
am
sure
that
all
due
respect
would
be
shown
princess
mary
read
the
and
her
face
began
to
quiver
with
stifled
whom
did
you
get
she
probably
recognized
that
i
am
by
my
replied
mademoiselle
bourienne
princess
with
the
paper
in
her
rose
from
the
window
and
with
a
pale
face
went
out
of
the
room
and
into
what
had
been
prince
send
or
or
somebody
to
she
tell
mademoiselle
bourienne
not
to
come
to
she
hearing
mademoiselle
must
go
at
at
she
appalled
at
the
thought
of
being
left
in
the
hands
of
the
prince
andrew
heard
that
i
was
in
the
power
of
the
that
the
daughter
of
prince
nicholas
asked
general
rameau
for
protection
and
accepted
his
this
idea
horrified
made
her
and
feel
such
a
rush
of
anger
and
pride
as
she
had
never
experienced
all
that
was
and
especially
all
that
was
in
her
position
rose
vividly
to
her
the
would
settle
in
this
le
general
rameau
would
occupy
prince
study
and
amuse
himself
by
looking
through
and
reading
his
letters
and
mademoiselle
bourienne
would
do
the
honors
of
bogucharovo
for
i
should
be
given
a
small
room
as
a
the
soldiers
would
violate
my
newly
dug
grave
to
steal
his
crosses
and
they
would
tell
me
of
their
victories
over
the
and
would
pretend
to
sympathize
with
my
thought
princess
not
thinking
her
own
thoughts
but
feeling
bound
to
think
like
her
father
and
her
for
herself
she
did
not
care
where
she
remained
or
what
happened
to
but
she
felt
herself
the
representative
of
her
dead
father
and
of
prince
involuntarily
she
thought
their
thoughts
and
felt
their
what
they
would
have
said
and
what
they
would
have
done
she
felt
bound
to
say
and
she
went
into
prince
trying
to
enter
completely
into
his
and
considered
her
the
demands
of
which
had
seemed
to
her
annihilated
by
her
all
at
once
rose
before
her
with
a
previously
unknown
force
and
took
possession
of
agitated
and
flushed
she
paced
the
sending
now
for
michael
ivanovich
and
now
for
tikhon
or
the
and
the
other
maids
could
not
say
in
how
far
mademoiselle
statement
was
alpatych
was
not
at
he
had
gone
to
the
neither
could
the
architect
michael
who
on
being
sent
for
came
in
with
sleepy
tell
princess
mary
with
just
the
same
smile
of
agreement
with
which
for
fifteen
years
he
had
been
accustomed
to
answer
the
old
prince
without
expressing
views
of
his
he
now
replied
to
princess
so
that
nothing
definite
could
be
got
from
his
the
old
valet
with
emaciated
face
that
bore
the
stamp
of
inconsolable
to
all
princess
questions
and
hardly
refrained
from
sobbing
as
he
looked
at
at
length
the
village
entered
the
room
and
with
a
deep
bow
to
princess
mary
came
to
a
halt
by
the
princess
mary
walked
up
and
down
the
room
and
stopped
in
front
of
she
regarding
as
a
sure
friend
this
dronushka
who
always
used
to
bring
a
special
kind
of
gingerbread
from
his
visit
to
the
fair
at
vyazma
every
year
and
smilingly

a
they

of

strange
that
at
a
moment
when

sorrow
was
filling
her
there
could
be
rich
people
and
and
the
rich
could
refrain
from
helping

heard
vaguely
that

was
such
a
thing
as

was
sometimes
given
to
the
she
also
knew
that
neither
her
father
nor
her
brother
would
refuse
to
help
the
peasants
in
she
only
feared
to
make
some
mistake
in
speaking
about
the
distribution
of
the
grain
she
wished
to
she
was
glad
such
cares
presented
enabling
her
without
scruple
to
forget
her
own
she
began
asking

never
doubted

that
she
was
ready
to

for
the
chapter

she
thought
as
she
went
out
in
the
twilight
toward
the
crowd
standing
on
the
pasture
by
the
the
men
crowded
closer
and
rapidly
took
off
their
princess
mary
lowered
her
eyes
tripping
over
her
came
close
up
to
so
many
different
old
and
were
fixed
on
and
there
were
so
many
different
that
she
could
not
distinguish
any
of
them
feeling
that
she
must
speak
to
them
all
at
did
not
know
how
to
do
but
again
the
sense
that
she
represented
her
father
and
her
brother
gave
her
and
she
boldly
began
her
am
very
glad
you
have
she
said
without
raising
her
and
feeling
her
heart
beating
quickly
and
tells
me
that
the
war
has
ruined
that
is
our
common
and
i
shall
grudge
nothing
to
help
i
am
myself
going
away
because
it
is
dangerous
the
enemy
is
i
am
giving
you
my
and
i
beg
you
to
take
all
our
so
that
you
may
not
suffer
and
if
you
have
been
told
that
i
am
giving
you
the
grain
to
keep
you
is
not
on
the
i
ask
you
to
go
with
all
your
belongings
to
our
estate
near
and
i
promise
you
i
will
see
to
it
that
there
you
shall
want

be
given
food
and
the
princess
sighs
were
the
only
sound
heard
in
the
am
not
doing
this
on
my
own
she
do
it
in
the
name
of
my
dead
who
was
a
good
master
to
and
of
my
brother
and
his
again
she
no
one
broke
the
is
a
common
misfortune
and
we
will
share
it
all
that
is
mine
is
she
scanning
the
faces
before
all
eyes
were
gazing
at
her
with
one
and
the
same
she
could
not
fathom
whether
it
was
or
apprehension
and
the
expression
on
all
the
faces
was
are
all
very
thankful
for
your
but
it
do
for
us
to
take
the
said
a
voice
at
the
back
of
the
why
asked
the
no
one
replied
and
princess
looking
round
at
the
found
that
every
eye
she
met
now
was
immediately
why
you
want
to
take
she
asked
no
one
the
silence
began
to
oppress
the
princess
and
she
tried
to
catch
you
she
inquired
of
a
very
old
man
who
stood
just
in
front
of
her
leaning
on
his
you
think
something
more
is
tell
i
will
do
said
catching
his
but
as
if
this
angered
he
bent
his
head
quite
low
and
should
we
we
want
the
should
we
give
up
we
we
are
sorry
for
but
not
go
away
came
from
various
sides
of
the
and
again
all
the
faces
in
that
crowd
bore
an
identical
though
now
it
was
certainly
not
an
expression
of
curiosity
or
but
of
angry
you
have
understood
said
princess
mary
with
a
sad
you
want
to
i
promise
to
house
and
feed
while
here
the
enemy
would
ruin
but
her
voice
was
drowned
by
the
voices
of
the
not
let
them
ruin
we
take
your
we
again
princess
mary
tried
to
catch
but
not
a
single
eye
in
the
crowd
was
turned
to
evidently
they
were
all
trying
to
avoid
her
she
felt
strange
and
an
artful
follow
her
into
pull
down
your
houses
and
go
into
i
dare
give
you
she
voices
in
the
crowd
were
heard
with
drooping
head
princess
mary
left
the
crowd
and
went
back
to
the
having
repeated
her
order
to
dron
to
have
horses
ready
for
her
departure
next
she
went
to
her
room
and
remained
alone
with
her
own
chapter
xii
for
a
long
time
that
night
princess
mary
sat
by
the
open
window
of
her
room
hearing
the
sound
of
the
voices
that
reached
her
from
the
but
it
was
not
of
them
she
was
she
felt
that
she
could
not
understand
them
however
much
she
might
think
about
she
thought
only
of
one
her
after
the
break
caused
by
cares
for
the
seemed
already
to
belong
to
the
now
she
could
remember
it
and
weep
or
after
sunset
the
wind
had
the
night
was
calm
and
toward
midnight
the
voices
began
to
a
cock
the
full
moon
began
to
show
from
behind
the
lime
a
fresh
white
dewy
mist
began
to
and
stillness
reigned
over
the
village
and
the
pictures
of
the
near
illness
and
last
one
after
another
to
her
with
mournful
pleasure
she
now
lingered
over
these
repelling
with
horror
only
the
last
the
picture
of
his
which
she
felt
she
could
not
contemplate
even
in
imagination
at
this
still
and
mystic
hour
of
and
these
pictures
presented
themselves
to
her
so
clearly
and
in
such
detail
that
they
seemed
now
now
and
now
she
vividly
recalled
the
moment
when
he
had
his
first
stroke
and
was
being
dragged
along
by
his
armpits
through
the
garden
at
bald
muttering
something
with
his
helpless
twitching
his
gray
eyebrows
and
looking
uneasily
and
timidly
at
then
he
wanted
to
tell
me
what
he
told
me
the
day
he
she
had
always
thought
what
he
said
and
she
recalled
in
all
its
detail
the
night
at
bald
hills
before
he
had
the
last
when
with
a
foreboding
of
disaster
she
had
remained
at
home
against
his
she
had
not
slept
and
had
stolen
downstairs
on
and
going
to
the
door
of
the
conservatory
where
he
slept
that
night
had
listened
at
the
in
a
suffering
and
weary
voice
he
was
saying
something
to
speaking
of
the
crimea
and
its
warm
nights
and
of
the
evidently
he
had
wanted
to
why
he
call
why
he
let
me
be
there
instead
of
princess
mary
had
thought
and
thought
again
he
will
never
tell
anyone
what
he
had
in
his
never
will
that
moment
return
for
him
or
for
me
when
he
might
have
said
all
he
longed
to
and
not
tikhon
but
i
might
have
heard
and
understood
why
i
enter
the
she
he
would
then
have
said
to
me
what
he
said
the
day
he
while
talking
to
tikhon
he
asked
about
me
he
wanted
to
see
and
i
was
standing
close
outside
the
it
was
sad
and
painful
for
him
to
talk
to
tikhon
who
did
not
understand
i
remember
how
he
began
speaking
to
him
about
lise
as
if
she
were
had
forgotten
she
was
tikhon
reminded
him
that
she
was
no
and
he
he
was
greatly
from
behind
the
door
i
heard
how
he
lay
down
on
his
bed
groaning
and
loudly
why
i
go
in
what
could
he
have
done
to
what
could
i
have
and
perhaps
he
would
then
have
been
comforted
and
would
have
said
that
word
to
and
princess
mary
uttered
aloud
the
caressing
word
he
had
said
to
her
on
the
day
of
his
she
and
began
with
tears
that
relieved
her
she
now
saw
his
face
before
and
not
the
face
she
had
known
ever
since
she
could
remember
and
had
always
seen
at
a
but
the
feeble
face
she
had
seen
for
the
first
time
quite
with
all
its
wrinkles
and
when
she
stooped
near
to
his
mouth
to
catch
what
he
she
repeated
was
he
thinking
when
he
uttered
that
what
is
he
thinking
this
question
suddenly
presented
itself
to
and
in
answer
she
saw
him
before
her
with
the
expression
that
was
on
his
face
as
he
lay
in
his
coffin
with
his
chin
bound
up
with
a
white
and
the
horror
that
had
seized
her
when
she
touched
him
and
convinced
herself
that
that
was
not
but
something
mysterious
and
seized
her
she
tried
to
think
of
something
else
and
to
but
could
do
with
eyes
she
gazed
at
the
moonlight
and
the
expecting
every
moment
to
see
his
dead
and
she
felt
that
the
silence
brooding
over
the
house
and
within
it
held
her
she
she
screamed
and
tearing
herself
out
of
this
silence
she
ran
to
the
quarters
to
meet
her
old
nurse
and
the
maidservants
who
came
running
toward
chapter
xiii

the
seventeenth
of
august

accompanied
by
lavrushka

perhaps
they

your

alpatych
with
a
staid
as
he
pointed
at
the
old
men
with
his

not

at

said
rostov
gave
his
horse
to

and
followed
alpatych
to
the
questioning
him
as
to
the
state
of
it
appeared
that
the
offer
of
corn
to
the
peasants
the
previous
and
her
talk
with
dron
and
at
the
had
actually
had
so
bad
an
effect
that
dron
had
finally
given
up
the
keys
and
joined
the
peasants
and
had
not
appeared
when
alpatych
sent
for
and
that
in
the
morning
when
the
princess
gave
orders
to
harness
for
her
the
peasants
had
come
in
a
large
crowd
to
the
barn
and
sent
word
that
they
would
not
let
her
leave
the
that
there
was
an
order
not
to
and
that
they
would
unharness

alpatych
had
gone
out
to
admonish
but
was
told

chiefly
karp
who
did
the
dron
not
showing
himself
in
the
that
they
could
not
let
the
princess
that
there
was
an
order
to
the
but
that
if
she
stayed
they
would
serve
her
as
before
and
obey
her
in
at
the
moment
when
rostov
and
ilyin
were
galloping
along
the
princess
despite
the
dissuasions
of
her
and
the
had
given
orders
to
harness
and
intended
to
but
when
the
cavalrymen
were
espied
they
were
taken
for

and
the
women
in

as
rostov
passed
through
the
princess

was
sitting
helpless
and
bewildered
in
the
large
sitting
when
rostov
was
shown
she
could
not
grasp
who
he
was
and
why
he
had
or
what
was
happening
to
when
she
saw
his
russian
and
by
his
walk
and
the
first
words
he
uttered
recognized
him
as
a
man
of
her
own
she
glanced
at
him
with
her
deep
radiant
look
and
began
speaking
in
a
voice
that
faltered
and
trembled
with
this
meeting
immediately
struck
rostov
as
a
romantic
helpless
girl
overwhelmed
with
left
to
the
mercy
of
rioting
and
what
a
strange
fate
sent
me
what
gentleness
and
nobility
there
are
in
her
features
and
thought
he
as
he
looked
at
her
and
listened
to
her
timid
when
she
began
to
tell
him
that
all
this
had
happened
the
day
after
her
her
voice
she
turned
and
as
if
fearing
he
might
take
her
words
as
meant
to
move
him
to
looked
at
him
with
an
apprehensive
glance
of

were
tears
in
princess
mary
noticed
this
and
glanced
gratefully
at
him
with
that
radiant
look
which
caused
the
plainness
of
her
face
to
be

how
glad
i
am
that

happened
to

able
to

give
you
my
word
of

me
to
act
as
your

bowing
as
if
to
a
lady
of

he
moved
toward
the
deferential
tone

to
indicate
that
though
he
would
consider
himself
happy
to
be
acquainted
with

did
not
wish
to
take
advantage
of
her
misfortunes

this
and

on
glancing
at

ilyin
stopped
he
saw
that
his
hero
and
commander
was
following
quite
a
different
train
of
rostov
glanced
angrily
at
ilyin
and
without
replying
strode
off
with
rapid
steps
to
the
show

and
sternly
turned
on
what

that
at
the
present
moment
it
would
be
imprudent

would
it
not
be
better

rostov
breathless
with
irrational
animal
fury
and
the
need
to
vent
without
considering
what
he
would
do
he
moved
unconciously
with
resolute
steps
toward
the

the
nearer
he
drew
to
it
the
more
alpatych
felt
that
this
unreasonable
action
might
produce

the
peasants
in
the
crowd
were
similarly
impressed
when
they
saw
firm
steps
and
frowning
after
the
hussars
had
come
to
the
village
and
rostov
had
gone
to
see
the
a
certain
confusion
and
dissension
had
arisen
among

of

of

that

pressed

prince
andrew
knew
denisov
from
what
natasha
had
told
him
of
her
first
this
memory
carried
him
sadly
and
sweetly
back
to
those
painful
feelings
of
which
he
had
not
thought
but
which
still
found
place
in
his
of
late
he
had
received
so
many
new
and
very
serious
as
the
retreat
from
his
visit
to
bald
and
the
recent
news
of
his
had
experienced
so
many
that
for
a
long
time
past
those
memories
had
not
entered
his
and
now
that
they
they
did
not
act
on
him
with
nearly
their
former

the
memories

by
the
name
of
bolkonski

to
a
romantic
when
after
supper
and
after
singing
he
had
proposed
to
a
little
girl
of
fifteen
without
realizing
what
he
was
he
smiled
at
the
recollection
of
that
time
and
of
his
love
for
and
passed
at
once
to
what
now
interested
him
passionately
and
this
was
a
plan
of
campaign
he
had
devised
while
serving
at
the
outposts
during
the
he
had
proposed
that
plan
to
barclay
de
tolly
and
now
wished
to
propose
it
to
the
plan
was
based
on
the
fact
that
the
french
line
of
operation
was
too
and
it
proposed
that
instead
or
concurrently
action
on
the
front
to
bar
the
advance
of
the
we
should
attack

line

denisov
rose
and
began
gesticulating
as
he
explained
his
plan
to
in
the
midst
of
his
explanation
shouts
were
heard
from
the
growing
more
incoherent
and
more
mingling
with
music
and
songs
and
coming
from
the
field
where
the
review
was
sounds
of
hoofs
and
shouts
were
nearing
the
shouted
a
cossack
standing
at
the
bolkonski
and
denisov
moved
to
the
at
which
a
knot
of
soldiers
guard
of
was
and
they
saw
kutuzov
coming
down
the
street
mounted
on
a
rather
small
sorrel
a
huge
suite
of
generals
rode
behind
barclay
was
riding
almost
beside
and
a
crowd
of
officers
ran
after
and
around
them
his
adjutants
galloped
into
the
yard
before
kutuzov
was
impatiently
urging
on
his
which
ambled
smoothly
under
his
and
he
raised
his
hand
to
his
white
horse
cap
with
a
red
band
and
no
nodding
his
head
when
he
came
up
to
the
guard
of
a
fine
set
of
grenadiers
mostly
wearing
who
were
giving
him
the
he
looked
at
them
silently
and
attentively
for
nearly
a
minute
with
the
steady
gaze
of
a
commander
and
then
turned
to
the
crowd
of
generals
and
officers
surrounding
suddenly
his
face
assumed
a
subtle
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
an
air
of
with
such
fine
fellows
to
retreat
and
he
and
rode
into
the
yard
past
prince
andrew
and
shouted
those
behind
since
prince
andrew
had
last
seen
him
kutuzov
had
grown
still
more
and
but
the
bleached
the
and
the
familiar
weariness
of
his
expression
were
still
the
he
was
wearing
the
white
horse
cap
and
a
military
overcoat
with
a
whip
hanging
over
his
shoulder
by
a
thin

sat
heavily
and
swayed
limply
on
his

whistled
just
audibly
as
he
rode
into

expressed
the
relief
of
relaxed
strain
felt
by
a
man
who
means
to

with

again
glanced
at
prince
as
often
occurs
with
old
it
was
only
after
some
seconds
that
the
impression
produced
by
prince
face
linked
itself
up
with
remembrance
of
his
how
do
you
my
dear
how
do
you
my
dear
come
said
glancing
wearily
and
he
stepped
onto
the
porch
which
creaked
under
his
he
unbuttoned
his
coat
and
sat
down
on
a
bench
in
the
your
received
news
of
his
replied
prince
andrew
kutuzov
looked
at
him
with
eyes
wide
open
with
dismay
and
then
took
off
his
cap
and
crossed
the
kingdom
of
heaven

he
sighed
his
whole
chest
and
was
silent
for
a
loved

and
respected
and
sympathize
with
you
with
all

embraced
prince
pressing
him
to
his
fat
and
for
some
time
did
not
let
him
when
he
released
him
prince
andrew
saw
that
flabby
lips
were
trembling
and
that
tears
were
in
his
he
sighed
and
pressed
on
the
bench
with
both
hands
to
raise
come
with
have
a
said
but
at
that
moment
no
more
intimidated
by

superiors
than
by

came
with
jingling
spurs
up
the
steps
of

despite
the
angry
whispers
of
the
adjutants
who
tried
to
stop
his
hands
still
pressed
on

at

having
given

had
to

of
great
importance
for

kutuzov
looked
wearily
at
him
lifting
his
hands
with
a
gesture
of
folded
them
across
his
repeating
the
our
what
is
denisov
blushed
like
a
girl
was
strange
to
see
the
color
rise
in
that
worn
and
boldly
began
to
expound
his
plan
of
cutting
the
lines
of
communication
between
smolensk
and
denisov
came
from
those
parts
and
knew
the
country
his
plan
seemed
decidedly
a
good
especially
from
the
strength
of
conviction
with
which
he
kutuzov
looked
down
at
his
own
occasionally
glancing
at
the
door
of
the
adjoining
hut
as
if
expecting
something
unpleasant
to
emerge
from
and
from
that
while
denisov
was
a
general
with
a
portfolio
under
his
arm
really
did
said
in
the
midst
of
you
ready
so
your
serene
replied
the
kutuzov
swayed
his
as
much
as
to
is
one
man
to
deal
with
it
and
again
listened
to
give
my
word
of
honor
as
a
wussian

the
staff
and
tomorrow

with
a
nod
to
denisov
he
turned
away
and
put
out
his
hand
for
the
papers
konovnitsyn
had
brought
not
your
serene
highness
like
to
come
said
the
general
on
duty
in
a
discontented
plans
must
be
examined
and
several
papers
have
to
be
an
adjutant
came
out
and
announced
that
everything
was
in
readiness
but
kutuzov
evidently
did
not
wish
to
enter
that
room
till
he
was
he
made
a
tell
them
to
bring
a
small
table
out
my
dear
look
at
them
said
go
he
turning
to
prince
who
remained
in
the
porch
and
listened
to
the
while
this
was
being
prince
andrew
heard
the
whisper
of
a
voice
and
the
rustle
of
a
silk
dress
behind
the
several
times
on
glancing
that
way
he
noticed
behind
that
door
a
handsome
woman
in
a
pink
dress
with
a
lilac
silk
kerchief
on
her
holding
a
dish
and
evidently
awaiting
the
entrance
of
the
adjutant
whispered
to
prince
andrew
that
this
was
the
wife
of
the
priest
whose
home
it
and
that
she
intended
to
offer
his
serene
highness
bread
and
husband
has
welcomed
his
serene
highness
with
the
cross
at
the
and
she
intends
to
welcome
him
in
the
very
added
the
adjutant
with
a
at
those
words
kutuzov
looked
he
was
listening
to
the
which
consisted
chiefly
of
a
criticism
of
the
position
at
he
had
listened
to
and
seven
years
previously
had
listened
to
the
discussion
at
the
austerlitz
council
of
he
evidently
listened
only
because
he
had
ears
though
there
was
a
piece
of
tow
in
one
of
could
not
help
but
it
was
evident
that
nothing
the
general
could
say
would
surprise
or
even
interest
that
he
knew
all
that
would
be
said
and
heard
it
all
only
because
he
had
as
one
has
to
listen
to
the
chanting
of
a
service
of
all
that
denisov
had
said
was
clever
and
to
the
what
the
general
was
saying
was
even
more
clever
and
to
the
but
it
was
evident
that
kutuzov
despised
knowledge
and
and
knew
of
something
else
that
would
decide
the
independent
of
cleverness
and
prince
andrew
watched
the
face
and
the
only
expression
he
could
see
there
was
one
of
curiosity
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
feminine
whispering
behind
the
and
a
desire
to
observe
it
was
evident
that
kutuzov
despised
cleverness
and
learning
and
even
the
patriotic
feeling
shown
by
but
despised
them
not
because
of
his
own
or
did
not
try
to
display
any
of
because
of
something
he
despised
them
because
of
his
old
age
and
experience
of
the
only
instruction
kutuzov
gave
of
his
own
accord
during
that
report
referred
to
looting
by
the
russian
at
the
end
of
the
report
the
general
put
before
him
for
signature
a
paper
relating
to
the
recovery
of
payment
from
army
commanders
for
green
oats
mown
down
by
the
when
landowners
lodged

for

hearing
the
kutuzov

his
lips
together

shook
his

into
the

looked
at
the
paper

shaking
his
chapter

said
kutuzov
as
he
signed
the
last
of
the
and
rising
heavily
and
smoothing
out
the
folds
in
his
fat
white
neck
he
moved
toward
the
door

a

moving

of

assigned
to

with
dimples
in
her
rosy
cheeks
followed
him
into

the
adjutant
came
out
to
the
porch
and
asked
prince
andrew
to
lunch
with
half
an
hour
later
prince
andrew

again
called
to

found

agitated
evidently
picturing
vividly

said
with
a
grim
evidently

agitating
and
sent

a

prince
face
at
this
taking
his
hand
and
drawing
him
kutuzov
offered
his
cheek
to
be
and
again
prince
andrew
noticed
tears
in
the
old
though
prince
andrew
knew
that
tears
came
and
that
he
was
particularly
tender
to
and
considerate
of
him
from
a
wish
to
show
sympathy
with
his
yet
this
reminder
of
austerlitz
was
both
pleasant
and
flattering
to
your
way
and
god
be
with
i
know
your
path
is
the
path
of
he
missed
you
at
but
i
needed
someone
to
and
changing
the
kutuzov
began
to
speak
of
the
turkish
war
and
the
peace
that
had
been
i
have
been
much
he
for
that
war
and
the
but
everything
came
at
the
right
tout
vient
a
point
a
celui
qui
sait
and
there
were
as
many
advisers
there
as
he
went
returning
to
the
subject
of
which
evidently
occupied
those
said
we
had
listened
to
them
all
we
should
not
have
made
peace
with
turkey
and
should
not
have
been
through
with
that
everything
in
but
more
less
kamenski
would
have
been
lost
if
he
had
not
he
stormed
fortresses
with
thirty
thousand
it
is
not
difficult
to
capture
a
fortress
but
it
is
difficult
to
win
a
for
not
storming
and
attacking
but
patience
and
time
are
kamenski
sent
soldiers
to
but
i
only
employed
these
two
things
and
took
more
fortresses
than
kamenski
and
made
them
turks
eat
he
swayed
his
the
french
shall
believe
he
went
growing
warmer
and
beating
his
make
them
eat
and
tears
again
dimmed
his
comes
in
time
to
him
who
knows
how
to
we
have
to
accept
remarked
prince
shall
if
everybody
wants
it
be
but
believe
my
dear
there
is
nothing
stronger
than
those
patience
and
they
will
do
it
but
the
advisers
pas
de
cette
voila
le
some
want
a
one
to
he
evidently
expecting
an
what
do
you
want
us
to
he
repeated
and
his
eye
shone
with
a
shrewd
tell
you
what
to
he
as
prince
andrew
still
did
not
will
tell
you
what
to
and
what
i
dans
le
mon
he
articulated
the
french
proverb
see
it
that
the
in
my
dear
do
my
dear
remember
that
with
all
my
heart
i
share
your
and
that
for
you
i
am
not
a
serene
nor
a
nor
a
but
a
if
you
want
anything
come
straight
to
my
dear
again
he
embraced
and
kissed
prince
but
before
the
latter
had
left
the
room
kutuzov
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
and
went
on
with
his
unfinished
les
chevaliers
du
cygne
by
madame
de
prince
andrew
could
not
have
explained
how
or
why
it
but
after
that
interview
with
kutuzov
he
went
back
to
his
regiment
reassured
as
to
the
general
course
of
affairs
and
as
to
the
man
to
whom
it
had
been
the
more
he
realized
the
absence
of
all
personal
motive
in
that
old
whom
there
seemed
to
remain
only
the
habit
of
and
in
place
of
an
intellect
events
and
drawing
only
the
capacity
calmly
to
contemplate
the
course
of
more
reassured
he
was
that
everything
would
be
as
it
will
not
bring
in
any
plan
of
his
he
will
not
devise
or
undertake
thought
prince
he
will
hear
remember
and
put
everything
in
its
he
will
not
hinder
anything
useful
nor
allow
anything
he
understands
that
there
is
something
stronger
and
more
important
than
his
own
inevitable
course
of
and
he
can
see
them
and
grasp
their
and
seeing
that
significance
can
refrain
from
meddling
and
renounce
his
personal
wish
directed
to
something
and
above
thought
prince
believes
in
him
because
despite
the
novel
by
genlis
and
the
french
and
because
his
voice
shook
when
he
they
have
brought
us
and
had
a
sob
in
it
when
he
said
he
would
them
eat
on
such
more
or
less
dimly
shared
by
the
unanimity
and
general
approval
were
founded
with
despite
court
the
popular
choice
of
kutuzov
as
was
chapter
xvii
after
the
emperor
had
left
life
flowed
on
there
in
its
usual
and
its
course
was
so
very
usual
that
it
was
difficult
to
remember
the
recent
days
of
patriotic
elation
and
hard
to
believe
that
russia
was
really
in
danger
and
that
the
members
of
the
english
club
were
also
sons
of
the
fatherland
ready
to
sacrifice
everything
for
the
one
thing
that
recalled
the
patriotic
fervor
everyone
had
displayed
during
the
stay
was
the
call
for
contributions
of
men
and
a
necessity
that
as
soon
as
the
promises
had
been
made
assumed
a
official
form
and
became
with
the
approach
to
the
view
of
their
situation
did
not
grow
more
serious
but
on
the
contrary
became
even
more
as
always
happens
with
people
who
see
a
great
danger
at
the
approach
of
danger
there
are
always
two
voices
that
speak
with
equal
power
in
the
human
one
very
reasonably
tells
a
man
to
consider
the
nature
of
the
danger
and
the
means
of
escaping
the
still
more
says
that
it
is
too
depressing
and
painful
to
think
of
the
since
it
is
not
in
power
to
foresee
everything
and
avert
the
general
course
of
and
it
is
therefore
better
to
disregard
what
is
painful
till
it
and
to
think
about
what
is
in
solitude
a
man
generally
listens
to
the
first
but
in
society
to
the
so
it
was
now
with
the
inhabitants
of
it
was
long
since
people
had
been
as
gay
in
moscow
as
that
headed
by
woodcuts
of
a
drink
a
and
a
moscow
burgher
called
karpushka
been
a
militiaman
and
having
had
rather
too
much
at
the
that
napoleon
wished
to
come
to
grew
abused
the
french
in
very
bad
came
out
of
the
drink
under
the
sign
of
the
began
to
address
the
assembled
were
read
and
together
with
the
latest
of
vasili
lvovich
bouts
in
the
corner
room
at
the
members
gathered
to
read
these
and
some
liked
the
way
karpushka
jeered
at
the
will
swell
up
with
russian
burst
with
our
buckwheat
and
choke
themselves
with
cabbage
they
are
all
dwarfs
and
one
peasant
woman
will
toss
three
of
them
with
a
others
did
not
like
that
tone
and
said
it
was
stupid
and
it
was
said
that
rostopchin
had
expelled
all
frenchmen
and
even
all
foreigners
from
and
that
there
had
been
some
spies
and
agents
of
napoleon
among
but
this
was
told
chiefly
to
introduce
witty
remark
on
that
the
foreigners
were
deported
to
nizhni
by
and
rostopchin
had
said
to
them
in
en
entrez
dans
la
et
faites
pas
une
barque
de
there
was
talk
of
all
the
government
offices
having
been
already
removed
from
and
to
this
witticism
was
for
that
alone
moscow
ought
to
be
grateful
to
it
was
said
that
regiment
would
cost
him
eight
hundred
thousand
and
that
bezukhov
had
spent
even
more
on
but
that
the
best
thing
about
action
was
that
he
himself
was
going
to
don
a
uniform
and
ride
at
the
head
of
his
regiment
without
charging
anything
for
the
it
get
into
the
and
take
care
not
to
make
it
a
barque
of
spare

julie
drubetskaya
as
she
collected
and
pressed
together
a
bunch
of
raveled
lint
with
her
beringed

preparing
to
leave
moscow
next
day

a
young
man
in
militia
uniform
whom
julie
called
and
who
was
going
with
her
to

as
in
many
other
circles
in
it
had
been
agreed
that
they
would
speak
nothing
but
russian
and
that
those
who
made
a
slip
and
spoke
french
should
pay
fines
to
the
committee
of

for

it
said
directing
a
sarcastic
glance
toward
the
militia
the
latter
in
presence
had
ceased
to
be
and
his
face
expressed
perplexity
as
to
what
smile

of
his
and
good
personality
immediately
checked

attempt
to

and
princess
bolkonskaya
you
i
really
believe
she
is
un
petit
peu
amoureuse
du
jeune
little
bit
in
love
with
the
young
how
could
one
say
that
in
chapter
xviii
when
pierre
returned
home
he
was
handed
two
of
broadsheets
that
had
been
brought
that
the
first
declared
that
the
report
that
count
rostopchin
had
forbidden
people
to
leave
moscow
was
on
the
contrary
he
was
glad
that
ladies
and
wives
were
leaving
the
will
be
less
panic
and
less
ran
the
broadsheet
i
will
stake
my
life
on
it
that
scoundrel
will
not
enter
these
words
showed
pierre
clearly
for
the
first
time
that
the
french
would
enter
the
second
broadsheet
stated
that
our
headquarters
were
at
that
count
wittgenstein
had
defeated
the
but
that
as
many
of
the
inhabitants
of
moscow
wished
to
be
weapons
were
ready
for
them
at
the
and
muskets
which
could
be
had
at
a
low
the
tone
of
the
proclamation
was
not
as
jocose
as
in
the
former
chigirin
pierre
pondered
over
these
evidently
the
terrible
stormcloud
he
had
desired
with
the
whole
strength
of
his
soul
but
which
yet
aroused
involuntary
horror
in
him
was
drawing
i
join
the
army
and
enter
the
or
he
asked
himself
for
the
hundredth
he
took
a
pack
of
cards
that
lay
on
the
table
and
began
to
lay
them
out
for
a
game
of
this
patience
comes
he
said
to
himself
after
shuffling
the
holding
them
in
his
and
lifting
his
it
comes
it
what
does
it
he
had
not
decided
what
it
should
mean
when
he
heard
the
voice
of
the
eldest
princess
at
the
door
asking
whether
she
might
come
it
will
mean
that
i
must
go
to
the
said
pierre
to
come
he
added
to
the
only
the
eldest
the
one
with
the
stony
face
and
long
was
still
living
in
the
two
younger
ones
had
both
my
coming
to
she
said
in
a
reproachful
and
agitated
know
some
decision
must
be
come
what
is
going
to
everyone
has
left
moscow
and
the
people
are
how
is
it
that
we
are
staying
the
things
seem
ma
said
pierre
in
the
bantering
tone
he
habitually
adopted
toward
always
feeling
uncomfortable
in
the
role
of
her
very
barbara
ivanovna
told
me
today
how
our
troops
are
distinguishing
it
certainly
does
them
and
the
people
too
are
quite
no
longer
even
my
maid
has
taken
to
being
at
this
rate
they
will
soon
begin
beating
one
walk
in
the
above
the
french
will
be
here
any
day
so
what
are
we
waiting
i
ask
just
one
thing
of
she
went
for
me
to
be
taken
to
whatever
i
may
i
live
under

where
do
you
get
your
information
on
the

to
your
others

if
they
if
you
want
to
do

give
the
order
at
the
princess

apparently
vexed
at
not
having
anyone
to
be
angry
muttering
to
she
sat
down
on
a
you
have
been
said
is
quiet
in
the
city
and
there
is
not
the
slightest
just
been
he
showed
her
the
rostopchin
writes
that
he
will
stake
his
life
on
it
that
the
enemy
will
not
enter
that
count
of
said
the
princess
is
a
a
rascal
who
has
himself
roused
the
people
to
he
write
in
those
idiotic
broadsheets
that
it
might
should
be
dragged
to
the
lockup
by
his
honor
and
glory
to
whoever
captures
he
this
is
what
his
cajolery
has
brought
us
barbara
ivanovna
told
me
the
mob
near
killed
her
because
she
said
something
in
but
you
take
everything
so
to
said
and
began
laying
out
his
cards
for
although
that
patience
did
come
pierre
did
not
join
the
but
remained
in
deserted
moscow
ever
in
the
same
state
of
and
yet
at
the
same
time
joyfully
expecting
something
next
day
toward
evening
the
princess
set
and
head
steward
came
to
inform
him
that
the
money
needed
for
the
equipment
of
his
regiment
could
not
be
found
without
selling
one
of
the
in
general
the
head
steward
made
out
to
pierre
that
his

pierre
listened
to
scarcely
able
to
repress
a
sell
said
to
be
i
draw
back
the
worse
everything
especially
his
own
the
better
was
pierre
pleased
and
the
more
evident
was
it
that
the
catastrophe
he
expected
was
hardly
anyone
he
knew
was
left
in
julie
had
and
so
had
princess
of
his
intimate
friends
only
the
rostovs
but
he
did
not
go
to
see
to
distract
his
thoughts
he
drove
that
day
to
the
village
of
vorontsovo
to
see
the
great
balloon
leppich
was
constructing
to
destroy
the
and
a
trial
balloon
that
was
to
go
up
next
the
balloon
was
not
yet
but
pierre
learned
that
it
was
being
constructed
by
the
the
emperor
had
written
to
count
rostopchin
as
as
soon
as
leppich
is
get
together
a
crew
of
reliable
and
intelligent
men
for
his
car
and
send
a
courier
to
general
kutuzov
to
let
him
i
have
informed
him
of
the
please
impress
upon
leppich
to
be
very
careful
where
he
descends
for
the
first
that
he
may
not
make
a
mistake
and
fall
into
the
it
is
essential
for
him
to
combine
his
movements
with
those
of
the
on
his
way
home
from
as
he
was
passing
the
bolotnoe
place
seeing
a
large
crowd
round
the
lobnoe
stopped
and
got
out
of
his
a
french
cook
accused
of
being
a
spy
was
being
the
flogging
was
only
just
and
the
executioner
was
releasing
from
the
flogging
bench
a
stout
man
with
red
in
blue
stockings
and
a
green
who
was
moaning
another
thin
and
stood
judging
by
their
faces
they
were
both
with
a
frightened
and
suffering
look
resembling
that
on
the
thin
pierre
pushed
his
way
in
through
the
is
who
is
what
is
it
he
kept
but
the
attention
of
the
and
women
in
cloaks
and
in
so
eagerly
centered
on
what
was
passing
in
lobnoe
place
that
no
one
answered
the
stout
man
shrugged
his
and
evidently
trying
to
appear
firm
began
to
pull
on
his
jacket
without
looking
about
but
suddenly
his
lips
trembled
and
he
began
to
in
the
way
men
though
angry
with
himself
for
doing
in
the
crowd
people
began
talking
to
stifle
their
feelings
of
pity
as
it
seemed
to
cook
to
some
russian
sauce
seems
to
be
sour
to
a
sets
his
teeth
on
said
a
wrinkled
clerk
who
was
standing
behind
when
the
frenchman
began
to
the
clerk
glanced
evidently
hoping
that
his
joke
would
be
some
people
began
to
others
continued
to
watch
in
dismay
the
executioner
who
was
undressing
the
other
pierre
his
face
and
he
turned
hastily
went
back
to
his
trap
muttering
something
to
himself
as
he
and
took
his
as
they
drove
along
he
shuddered
and
exclaimed
several
times
so
audibly
that
the
coachman
asked
is
your
are
you
shouted
pierre
to
the
who
was
driving
to
lubyanka
the
as
you
answered
the
shouted
abusing
his
thing
he
rarely
i
told
and
drive
must
get
away
this
very
he
murmured
to
at
the
sight
of
the
tortured
frenchman
and
the
crowd
surrounding
the
lobnoe
pierre
had
so
definitely
made
up
his
mind
that
he
could
no
longer
remain
in
moscow
and
would
leave
for
the
army
that
very
day
that
it
seemed
to
him
that
either
he
had
told
the
coachman
this
or
that
the
man
ought
to
have
known
it
for
on
reaching
home
pierre
gave
orders
to
head
coachman
who
knew
could
do
and
was
known
to
all
he
would
leave
that
night
for
the
army
at
and
that
his
saddle
horses
should
be
sent
this
could
not
all
be
arranged
that
so
on
representation
pierre
had
to
put
off
his
departure
till
next
day
to
allow
time
for
the
relay
horses
to
be
sent
on
in
on
the
the
weather
cleared
up
after
a
spell
of
and
after
dinner
pierre
left
when
changing
horses
that
night
in
he
learned
that
there
had
been
a
great
battle
that
was
the
battle
of
he
was
told
that
there
in
perkhushkovo
the
earth
trembled
from
the
but
nobody
could
answer
his
questions
as
to
who
had
at
dawn
next
day
pierre
was
approaching
every
house
in
mozhaysk
had
soldiers
quartered
in
and
at
the
hostel
where
pierre
was
met
by
his
groom
and
coachman
there
was
no
room
to
be
it
was
full
of
everywhere
in
mozhaysk
and
beyond
troops
were
stationed
or
on
the
foot
and
horse
and
cannon
were
pierre
pushed
forward
as
fast
as
he
and
the
farther
he
left
moscow
behind
and
the
deeper
he
plunged
into
that
sea
of
troops
the
more
was
he
overcome
by
restless
agitation
and
a
new
and
joyful
feeling
he
had
not
experienced
it
was
a
feeling
akin
to
what
he
had
felt
at
the
sloboda
palace
during
the
sense
of
the
necessity
of
undertaking
something
and
sacrificing
he
now
experienced
a
glad
consciousness
that
everything
that
constitutes
comforts
of
even
life
rubbish
it
is
pleasant
to
throw
compared
with
with
pierre
could
not
and
he
did
not
try
to
determine
for
whom
and
for
what
he
felt
such
particular
delight
in
sacrificing
he
was
not
occupied
with
the
question
of
what
to
sacrifice
the
fact
of
sacrificing
in
itself
afforded
him
a
new
and
joyous
chapter
xix
on
the
of
august
the
battle
of
the
shevardino
redoubt
was
on
the
not
a
shot
was
fired
by
either
and
on
the
the
battle
of
borodino
itself
took
why
and
how
were
the
battles
of
shevardino
and
borodino
given
and
why
was
the
battle
of
borodino
there
was
not
the
least
sense
in
it
for
either
the
french
or
the
its
immediate
result
for
the
russians
and
was
bound
to
that
we
were
brought
nearer
to
the
destruction
of
we
feared
more
than
anything
in
the
and
for
the
french
its
immediate
result
was
that
they
were
brought
nearer
to
the
destruction
of
their
whole
they
feared
more
than
anything
in
the
what
the
result
must
be
was
quite
and
yet
napoleon
offered
and
kutuzov
accepted
that
if
the
commanders
had
been
guided
by
it
would
seem
that
it
must
have
been
obvious
to
napoleon
that
by
advancing
thirteen
hundred
miles
and
giving
battle
with
a
probability
of
losing
a
quarter
of
his
he
was
advancing
to
certain
and
it
must
have
been
equally
clear
to
kutuzov
that
by
accepting
battle
and
risking
the
loss
of
a
quarter
of
his
army
he
would
certainly
lose
for
kutuzov
this
was
mathematically
as
it
is
that
if
when
playing
draughts
i
have
one
man
less
and
go
on
i
shall
certainly
and
therefore
should
not
when
my
opponent
has
sixteen
men
and
i
have
i
am
only
one
eighth
weaker
than
but
when
i
have
exchanged
thirteen
more
men
he
will
be
three
times
as
strong
as
i
before
the
battle
of
borodino
our
strength
in
proportion
to
the
french
was
about
as
five
to
but
after
that
battle
it
was
little
more
than
one
to
previously
we
had
a
hundred
thousand
against
a
hundred
and
twenty
afterwards
little
more
than
fifty
thousand
against
a
hundred
yet
the
shrewd
and
experienced
kutuzov
accepted
the
while
who
was
said
to
be
a
commander
of
gave
losing
a
quarter
of
his
army
and
lengthening
his
lines
of
communication
still
if
it
is
said
that
he
expected
to
end
the
campaign
by
occupying
moscow
as
he
had
ended
a
previous
campaign
by
occupying
there
is
much
evidence
to
the
historians
themselves
tell
us
that
from
smolensk
onwards
he
wished
to
knew
the
danger
of
his
extended
and
knew
that
the
occupation
of
moscow
would
not
be
the
end
of
the
for
he
had
seen
at
smolensk
the
state
in
which
russian
towns
were
left
to
and
had
not
received
a
single
reply
to
his
repeated
announcements
of
his
wish
to
in
giving
and
accepting
battle
at
kutuzov
acted
involuntarily
and
but
later
to
fit
what
had
the
historians
provided
cunningly
devised
evidence
of
the
foresight
and
genius
of
the
generals
of
all
the
blind
tools
of
history
were
the
most
enslaved
and
the
ancients
have
left
us
model
heroic
poems
in
which
the
heroes
furnish
the
whole
interest
of
the
and
we
are
still
unable
to
accustom
ourselves
to
the
fact
that
for
our
epoch
histories
of
that
kind
are
on
the
other
how
the
battle
of
borodino
and
the
preceding
battle
of
shevardino
were
there
also
exists
a
definite
and
but
quite
all
the
historians
describe
the
affair
as
the
russian
they
in
its
retreat
from
smolensk
sought
out
for
itself
the
best
position
for
a
general
engagement
and
found
such
a
position
at
the
they
fortified
this
position
in
advance
on
the
left
of
the
highroad
moscow
to
and
almost
at
a
right
angle
to
from
borodino
to
at
the
very
place
where
the
battle
was
in
front
of
this
they
a
fortified
outpost
was
set
up
on
the
shevardino
mound
to
observe
the
on
the
we
are
napoleon
attacked
this
advanced
post
and
took
on
the
attacked
the
whole
russian
which
was
in
position
on
the
field
of
so
the
histories
and
it
is
all
quite
as
anyone
who
cares
to
look
into
the
matter
can
easily
convince
the
russians
did
not
seek
out
the
best
position
on
the
during
the
retreat
passed
many
positions
better
than
they
did
not
stop
at
any
one
of
these
positions
because
kutuzov
did
not
wish
to
occupy
a
position
he
had
not
himself
because
the
popular
demand
for
a
battle
had
not
yet
expressed
itself
strongly
and
because
miloradovich
had
not
yet
arrived
with
the
and
for
many
other
the
fact
is
that
other
positions
they
had
passed
were
and
that
the
position
at
borodino
one
where
the
battle
was
far
from
being
was
no
more
a
position
than
any
other
spot
one
might
find
in
the
russian
empire
by
sticking
a
pin
into
the
map
at
not
only
did
the
russians
not
fortify
the
position
on
the
field
of
borodino
to
the
left
and
at
a
right
angle
the
highroad
the
position
on
which
the
battle
took
but
never
till
the
fifth
of
did
they
think
that
a
battle
might
be
fought
this
was
shown
first
by
the
fact
that
there
were
no
entrenchments
there
by
the
twenty
fifth
and
that
those
begun
on
the
and
were
not
and
by
the
position
of
the
shevardino
that
redoubt
was
quite
senseless
in
front
of
the
position
where
the
battle
was
why
was
it
more
strongly
fortified
than
any
other
and
why
were
all
efforts
exhausted
and
six
thousand
men
sacrificed
to
defend
it
till
late
at
night
on
the
a
cossack
patrol
would
have
sufficed
to
observe
the
as
proof
that
the
position
on
which
the
battle
was
fought
had
not
been
foreseen
and
that
the
shevardino
redoubt
was
not
an
advanced
post
of
that
we
have
the
fact
that
up
to
the
barclay
de
tolly
and
bagration
were
convinced
that
the
shevardino
redoubt
was
the
left
flank
of
the
and
that
kutuzov
himself
in
his
written
in
hot
haste
after
the
speaks
of
the
shevardino
redoubt
as
the
left
flank
of
the
it
was
much
when
reports
on
the
battle
of
borodino
were
written
at
that
the
incorrect
and
extraordinary
statement
was
invented
to
justify
the
mistakes
of
a
who
had
to
be
represented
as
that
the
shevardino
redoubt
was
an
advanced
in
reality
it
was
simply
a
fortified
point
on
the
left
that
the
battle
of
borodino
was
fought
by
us
on
an
entrenched
position
previously
where
as
it
was
fought
on
a
quite
unexpected
spot
which
was
almost
the
case
was
evidently
a
position
was
selected
along
the
river
crosses
the
highroad
not
at
a
right
angle
but
at
an
acute
that
the
left
flank
was
at
the
right
flank
near
the
village
of
and
the
center
at
borodino
at
the
confluence
of
the
rivers
kolocha
and
to
anyone
who
looks
at
the
field
of
borodino
without
thinking
of
how
the
battle
was
actually
this
protected
by
the
river
presents
itself
as
obvious
for
an
army
whose
object
was
to
prevent
an
enemy
from
advancing
along
the
smolensk
road
to
riding
to
valuevo
on
the
did
not
see
the
history
books
say
he
the
position
of
the
russians
from
utitsa
to
borodino
could
not
have
seen
that
position
because
it
did
not
nor
did
he
see
an
advanced
post
of
the
russian
but
while
pursuing
the
russian
rearguard
he
came
upon
the
left
flank
of
the
russian
the
shevardino
unexpectedly
for
the
russians
moved
his
army
across
the
and
the
not
having
time
to
begin
a
general
withdrew
their
left
wing
from
the
position
they
had
intended
to
occupy
and
took
up
a
new
position
which
had
not
been
foreseen
and
was
not
by
crossing
to
the
other
side
of
the
kolocha
to
the
left
of
the
napoleon
shifted
the
whole
forthcoming
battle
from
right
to
left
from
the
russian
and
transferred
it
to
the
plain
between
and
plain
no
more
advantageous
as
a
position
than
any
other
plain
in
there
the
whole
battle
of
the
of
august
took
had
napoleon
not
ridden
out
on
the
evening
of
the
to
the
and
had
he
not
then
ordered
an
immediate
attack
on
the
redoubt
but
had
begun
the
attack
next
no
one
would
have
doubted
that
the
shevardino
redoubt
was
the
left
flank
of
our
and
the
battle
would
have
taken
place
where
we
expected
in
that
case
we
should
probably
have
defended
the
shevardino
left
still
more
we
should
have
attacked
napoleon
in
the
center
or
on
the
and
the
engagement
would
have
taken
place
on
the
in
the
position
we
intended
and
had
but
as
the
attack
on
our
left
flank
took
place
in
the
evening
after
the
retreat
of
our
rear
guard
immediately
after
the
fight
at
and
as
the
russian
commanders
did
not
or
were
not
in
to
begin
a
general
engagement
then
on
the
evening
of
the
the
first
and
chief
action
of
the
battle
of
borodino
was
already
lost
on
the
and
obviously
led
to
the
loss
of
the
one
fought
on
the
after
the
loss
of
the
shevardino
we
found
ourselves
on
the
morning
of
the
without
a
position
for
our
left
and
were
forced
to
bend
it
back
and
hastily
entrench
it
where
it
chanced
to
not
only
was
the
russian
army
on
the
defended
by
unfinished
but
the
disadvantage
of
that
position
was
increased
by
the
fact
that
the
russian
having
fully
realized
what
had
namely
the
loss
of
our
position
on
the
left
flank
and
the
shifting
of
the
whole
field
of
the
forthcoming
battle
from
right
to
their
extended
position
from
the
village
of
novoe
to
and
consequently
had
to
move
their
forces
from
right
to
left
during
the
so
it
happened
that
throughout
the
whole
battle
the
russians
opposed
the
entire
french
army
launched
against
our
left
flank
with
but
half
as
many
action
against
and
on
the
right
flank
against
the
were
actions
distinct
from
the
main
course
of
the
so
the
battle
of
borodino
did
not
take
place
at
all
as
an
effort
to
conceal
our
mistakes
even
at
the
cost
of
diminishing
the
glory
due
to
the
russian
army
and
it
has
been
the
battle
of
borodino
was
not
fought
on
a
chosen
and
entrenched
position
with
forces
only
slightly
weaker
than
those
of
the
as
a
result
of
the
loss
of
the
shevardino
the
russians
fought
the
battle
of
borodino
on
an
open
and
almost
unentrenched
with
forces
only
half
as
numerous
as
the
that
is
to
under
conditions
in
which
it
was
not
merely
unthinkable
to
fight
for
ten
hours
and
secure
an
indecisive
but
unthinkable
to
keep
an
army
even
from
complete
disintegration

so
deep
in

the

been

wrapped
in

was
swollen

the
size
of

looking

passing
close
ah
quite
is
my
head
so
living
in
a
foreign
they
sang
their
dance
as
if
responding
to
them
but
with
a
different
sort
of
the
metallic
sound
of
the
bells
reverberated
high
above
and
the
hot
rays
of
the
sun
bathed
the
top
of

another

sad

of
the
obscurity
of

understood
what
he
wanted
to
say
and
nodded
the
road
was
clear
pierre
descended
the
hill
and
drove
he
kept
looking
to
either
side
of
the
road
for
familiar
but
only
saw
everywhere
the
unfamiliar
faces
of
various
military
men
of
different
branches
of
the
who
all
looked
with
astonishment
at
his
white
hat
and
green
tail
having
gone
nearly
three
miles
he
at
last
met
an
acquaintance
and
eagerly
addressed
this
was
one
of
the

army
he
was
driving
toward
pierre
in
a
covered
sitting
beside
a
young
and
on
recognizing
pierre
he
told
the
cossack
who
occupied
the
seat
to
pull
your
how
come
you
to
be
asked
the
you
i
wanted
to

be
something

and
talked
to

explaining
his

advised
him

with
his

his
serene

you

you
what
you
must
the
doctor
seemed
tired
and
in
a
think
i
also
wanted
to
ask
you
where
our
position
is

the

on

we

the
strange

that
of

of
young

who
had
stared
with
merry
surprise
at

the
very
men
he
had
twenty
thousand
were
inevitably
doomed
to
wounds
and
death
amazed
may
die
why
are
they
thinking
of
anything
but
and
by
some
latent
sequence
of
thought
the
descent
of
the

carts
with
the
the
ringing
the
slanting
rays
of
the
and
the
songs
of
the
cavalrymen

recurred
to
his
cavalry
ride
to
battle
and
meet
the
wounded
and
do
not
for
a
moment
think
of
what
awaits
but
pass
winking
at
the
yet
from
among
these
men
twenty
thousand
are
doomed
to

they
wonder
at
my

just
when

still
amused
by

novelty
of
their
position

more
thought
of
the
wounded
men
at
mozhaysk
and
understood
what
the
soldier
had
meant
when
he
want
the

nation
to
fall
on
the
sight
of
these
bearded
peasants
at

with
his

to
the

present
at
the
battle
and
to
see
the
is
what
you
must
said
will
do
the
honors
of
the
camp
to
you
will
see
everything
best
from
where
count
bennigsen
will
i
am
in
attendance
on
you
mention
it
to
but
if
you
want
to
ride
round
the
come
along
with
we
are
just
going
to
the
left
then
when
we
get
do
spend
the
night
with
me
and
arrange
a
game
of
of
course
you
know
dmitri
those
are
his
and
he
pointed
to
the
third
house
in
the
village
of
i
should
like
to
see
the
right
they
say
very
said
should
like
to
start
from
the
moskva
river
and
ride
round
the
whole
you
can
do
that
but
the
chief
thing
is
the
left
but
where
is
prince
can
you
point
it
out
to
we
shall
pass
it
and
take
you
to
about
the
left
asked
pierre
tell
you
the
between
god
only
knows
what
state
our
left
flank
is
said
boris
confidentially
lowering
his
is
not
at
all
what
count
bennigsen
he
meant
to
fortify
that
knoll
quite
boris
shrugged
his
serene
highness
would
not
have
or
someone
persuaded
you
but
boris
did
not
for
at
that
moment
came
up
to
said
addressing
him
with
an
unembarrassed
was
just
trying
to
explain
our
position
to
the
it
is
amazing
how
his
serene
highness
could
so
foresee
the
intentions
of
the
mean
the
left
asked
the
left
flank
is
now
extremely
though
kutuzov
had
dismissed
all
unnecessary
men
from
the
boris
had
contrived
to
remain
at
headquarters
after
the
he
had
established
himself
with
count
like
all
on
whom
boris
had
been
in
considered
young
prince
drubetskoy
an
invaluable
in
the
higher
command
there
were
two
sharply
defined
party
and
that
of
the
chief
of
boris
belonged
to
the
latter
and
no
one
while
showing
servile
respect
to
could
so
create
an
impression
that
the
old
fellow
was
not
much
good
and
that
bennigsen
managed
now
the
decisive
moment
of
battle
had
come
when
kutuzov
would
be
destroyed
and
the
power
pass
to
or
even
if
kutuzov
won
the
battle
it
would
be
felt
that
everything
was
done
by
in
any
case
many
great
rewards
would
have
to
be
given
for
and
new
men
would
come
to
the
so
boris
was
full
of
nervous
vivacity
all
after
others
whom
pierre
knew
came
up
to
and
he
had
not
time
to
reply
to
all
the
questions
about
moscow
that
were
showered
upon
or
to
listen
to
all
that
was
told
the
faces
all
expressed
animation
and
but
it
seemed
to
pierre
that
the
cause
of
the
excitement
shown
in
some
of
these
faces
lay
chiefly
in
questions
of
personal
his
was
occupied
by
the
different
expression
he
saw
on
other
expression
that
spoke
not
of
personal
matters
but
of
the
universal
questions
of
life
and
kutuzov
noticed
figure
and
the
group
gathered
round
him
to
said
an
adjutant
told
pierre
of
his
serene
and
pierre
went
toward
but
a
militiaman
got
there
before
it
was
did
that
fellow
get
asked
a
creature
that
wriggles
in
was
the
has
been
you
now
he
wants
to
bob
up
been
proposing
some
scheme
or
other
and
has
crawled
into
the
picket
line
at
a
brave
pierre
took
off
his
hat
and
bowed
respectfully
to
concluded
that
if
i
reported
to
your
serene
highness
you
might
send
me
away
or
say
that
you
knew
what
i
was
but
then
i
lose
dolokhov
was
if
i
were
i
should
be
rendering
a
service
to
my
fatherland
for
which
i
am
ready
to
should
your
serene
highness
require
a
man
who
will
not
spare
his
please
think
of
perhaps
i
may
prove
useful
to
your
serene
kutuzov
his
laughing
eye
narrowing
more
and
more
as
he
looked
at
just
then
with
his
courtierlike
stepped
up
to
side
near
kutuzov
and
in
a
most
natural
without
raising
his
said
to
as
though
continuing
an
interrupted
militia
have
put
on
clean
white
shirts
to
be
ready
to
what
boris
evidently
said
this
to
pierre
in
order
to
be
overheard
by
his
serene
he
knew
attention
would
be
caught
by
those
and
so
it
are
you
saying
about
the
he
asked
for
your
serene
have
put
on
clean
a
a
matchless
said
and
he
closed
his
eyes
and
swayed
his
matchless
he
repeated
with
a
you
want
to
smell
he
said
to
a
pleasant
i
have
the
honor
to
be
one
of
your
is
she
my
quarters
are
at
your
and
as
often
happens
with
old
kutuzov
began
looking
about
as
if
forgetting
all
he
wanted
to
say
or
evidently
remembering
what
he
he
beckoned
to
andrew
his
those
verses
of
how
do
they
those
he
wrote
about
for
the
corps
recite
recite
said
evidently
preparing
to
kaysarov
kutuzov
smilingly
nodded
his
head
to
the
rhythm
of
the
when
pierre
had
left
dolokhov
came
up
to
him
and
took
his
am
very
glad
to
meet
you
he
said
regardless
of
the
presence
of
strangers
and
in
a
particularly
resolute
and
solemn
the
eve
of
a
day
when
god
alone
knows
who
of
us
is
fated
to
i
am
glad
of
this
opportunity
to
tell
you
that
i
regret
the
misunderstandings
that
occurred
between
us
and
should
wish
you
not
to
have
any
ill
feeling
for
i
beg
you
to
forgive
pierre
looked
at
dolokhov
with
a
not
knowing
what
to
say
to
with
tears
in
his
eyes
dolokhov
embraced
pierre
and
kissed
boris
said
a
few
words
to
his
and
count
bennigsen
turned
to
pierre
and
proposed
that
he
should
ride
with
him
along
the
will
interest
said
very
replied
half
an
hour
later
kutuzov
left
for
and
bennigsen
and
his
with
pierre
among
set
out
on
their
ride
along
the
chapter
xxiii
from
bennigsen
descended
the
highroad
to
the
bridge
when
they
had
looked
at
it
from
the
the
officer
had
pointed
out
as
being
the
center
of
our
position
and
where
rows
of
fragrant
hay
lay
by
the
they
rode
across
that
bridge
into
the
village
of
borodino
and
thence
turned
to
the
passing
an
enormous
number
of
troops
and
and
came
to
a
high
knoll
where
militiamen
were
this
was
the
as
yet
which
afterwards
became
known
as
the
raevski
or
the
knoll
but
pierre
paid
no
special
attention
to
he
did
not
know
that
it
would
become
more
memorable
to
him
than
any
other
spot
on
the
plain
of
they
then
crossed
the
hollow
to
where
the
soldiers
were
dragging
away
the
last
logs
from
the
huts
and
then
they
rode
downhill
and
across
a
ryefield
trodden
and
beaten
down
as
if
by
following
a
track
freshly
made
by
the
artillery
over
the
furrows
of
the
plowed
and
reached
some
fleches
which
were
still
being
a
kind
of
at
the
fleches
bennigsen
stopped
and
began
looking
at
the
shevardino
redoubt
which
had
been
ours
the
day
before
and
where
several
horsemen
could
be
the
officers
said
that
either
napoleon
or
murat
was
and
they
all
gazed
eagerly
at
this
little
group
of
pierre
also
looked
at
trying
to
guess
which
of
the
scarcely
discernible
figures
was
at
last
those
mounted
men
rode
away
from
the
mound
and
bennigsen
spoke
to
a
general
who
approached
and
began
explaining
the
whole
position
of
our
pierre
listened
to
straining
each
faculty
to
understand
the
essential
points
of
the
impending
but
was
mortified
to
feel
that
his
mental
capacity
was
inadequate
for
the
he
could
make
nothing
of
bennigsen
stopped
speaking
noticing
that
pierre
was
suddenly
said
to
think
this
interests
the
contrary
very
replied
pierre
not
quite
from
the
fleches
they
rode
still
farther
to
the
along
a
road
winding
through
a
birch
in
the
middle
of
the
wood
a
brown
hare
with
white
feet
sprang
out
scared
by
the
tramp
of
the
many
grew
so
confused
that
it
leaped
along
the
road
in
front
of
them
for
some
arousing
general
attention
and
and
only
when
several
voices
shouted
at
it
did
it
dart
to
one
side
and
disappear
in
the
after
going
through
the
wood
for
about
a
mile
and
a
half
they
came
out
on
a
glade
where
troops
of
corps
were
stationed
to
defend
the
left
at
the
extreme
left
bennigsen
talked
a
great
deal
and
with
much
as
it
seemed
to
gave
orders
of
great
military
in
front
of
troops
was
some
high
ground
not
occupied
by
bennigsen
loudly
criticized
this
saying
that
it
was
madness
to
leave
a
height
which
commanded
the
country
around
unoccupied
and
to
place
troops
below
some
of
the
generals
expressed
the
same
one
in
particular
declared
with
martial
heat
that
they
were
put
there
to
be
bennigsen
on
his
own
authority
ordered
the
troops
to
occupy
the
high
this
disposition
on
the
left
flank
increased
doubt
of
his
own
capacity
to
understand
military
listening
to
bennigsen
and
the
generals
criticizing
the
position
of
the
troops
behind
the
he
quite
understood
them
and
shared
their
but
for
that
very
reason
he
could
not
understand
how
the
man
who
put
them
there
behind
the
hill
could
have
made
so
gross
and
palpable
a
pierre
did
not
know
that
these
troops
were
as
bennigsen
put
there
to
defend
the
but
were
in
a
concealed
position
as
an
that
they
should
not
be
seen
and
might
be
able
to
strike
an
approaching
enemy
bennigsen
did
not
know
this
and
moved
the
troops
forward
according
to
his
own
ideas
without
mentioning
the
matter
to
the
chapter
xxiv
on
that
bright
evening
of
august
prince
andrew
lay
leaning
on
his
elbow
in
a
shed
in
the
village
of
knyazkovo
at
the
further
end
of
his
through
a
gap
in
the
broken
wall
he
could
beside
the
wooden
a
row
of
thirty
birches
with
their
lower
branches
lopped
a
field
on
which
shocks
of
oats
were
and
some
bushes
near
which
rose
the
smoke
of
the
narrow
and
burdensome
and
useless
to
anyone
as
his
life
now
seemed
to
prince
andrew
on
the
eve
of
battle
felt
agitated
and
irritable
as
he
had
done
seven
years
before
at
he
had
received
and
given
the
orders
for
next
battle
and
had
nothing
more
to
but
his
and
therefore
most
terrible
give
him
no
he
knew
that
battle
would
be
the
most
terrible
of
all
he
had
taken
part
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
the
possibility
of
death
presented
itself
to
in
relation
to
any
worldly
matter
or
with
reference
to
its
effect
on
but
simply
in
relation
to
to
his
own
and
almost
as
a
and
from
the
height
of
this
perception
all
that
had
previously
tormented
and
preoccupied
him
suddenly
became
illumined
by
a
cold
white
light
without
without
without
distinction
of
all
life
appeared
to
him
like
pictures
at
which
he
had
long
been
gazing
by
artificial
light
through
a
now
he
suddenly
saw
those
badly
daubed
pictures
in
clear
daylight
and
without
a
there
they
those
false
images
that
and
tormented
said
he
to
passing
in
review
the
principal
pictures
of
the
magic
lantern
of
life
and
regarding
them
now
in
the
cold
white
daylight
of
his
clear
perception
of
they
those
rudely
painted
figures
that
once
seemed
splendid
and
the
good
of
love
of
a
the
fatherland
important
these
pictures
appeared
to
with
what
profound
meaning
they
seemed
to
be
and
it
is
all
so
and
crude
in
the
cold
white
light
of
this
morning
which
i
feel
is
dawning
for
the
three
great
sorrows
of
his
life
held
his
attention
in
his
love
for
a
his
and
the
french
invasion
which
had
overrun
half
that
little
girl
who
seemed
to
me
brimming
over
with
mystic
i
loved
i
made
romantic
plans
of
love
and
happiness
with
what
a
boy
i
he
said
aloud
i
believed
in
some
ideal
love
which
was
to
keep
her
faithful
to
me
for
the
whole
year
of
my
like
the
gentle
dove
in
the
fable
she
was
to
pine
apart
from
but
it
was
much
simpler
it
was
all
very
simple
and
my
father
built
bald
hills
he
thought
the
place
was
his
his
his
but
napoleon
came
and
swept
him
unconscious
of
his
as
he
might
brush
a
chip
from
his
and
his
bald
hills
and
his
whole
life
fell
to
princess
mary
says
it
is
a
trial
sent
from
what
is
the
trial
when
he
is
not
here
and
will
never
he
is
not
for
whom
then
is
the
trial
the
the
destruction
of
and
tomorrow
i
shall
be
perhaps
not
even
by
a
frenchman
but
by
one
of
our
own
by
a
soldier
discharging
a
musket
close
to
my
ear
as
one
of
them
did
and
the
french
will
come
and
take
me
by
head
and
heels
and
fling
me
into
a
hole
that
i
may
not
stink
under
their
and
new
conditions
of
life
will
which
will
seem
quite
ordinary
to
others
and
about
which
i
shall
know
i
shall
not
he
looked
at
the
row
of
birches
shining
in
the
with
their
motionless
green
and
yellow
foliage
and
white
to
be
killed
that
i
should
not
that
all
this
should
still
but
no
and
the
birches
with
their
light
and
the
curly
the
smoke
of
the
and
all
that
was
around
him
changed
and
seemed
terrible
and
a
cold
shiver
ran
down
his
he
rose
went
out
of
the
and
began
to
walk
after
he
had
voices
were
heard
outside
the
he
the
captain
formerly
squadron
but
now
from
lack
of
officers
a
battalion
shyly
entered
the
shed
followed
by
an
adjutant
and
the
regimental
prince
andrew
rose
listened
to
the
business
they
had
come
gave
them
some
further
and
was
about
to
dismiss
them
when
he
heard
a
voice
behind
the
take
said
the
voice
of
a
man
stumbling
over
prince
andrew
looked
out
of
the
shed
and
saw
who
had
tripped
over
a
pole
on
the
ground
and
had
nearly
coming
his
it
was
unpleasant
to
prince
andrew
to
meet
people
of
his
own
set
in
and
pierre
for
he
reminded
him
of
all
the
painful
moments
of
his
last
visit
to
what
a
said
brings
you
this
is
as
he
said
this
his
eyes
and
face
expressed
more
than
expressed
which
pierre
noticed
at
he
had
approached
the
shed
full
of
but
on
seeing
prince
face
he
felt
constrained
and
ill
at
have
you
it
interests
said
who
had
so
often
that
day
senselessly
repeated
that
word
wish
to
see
the
and
what
do
the
masonic
brothers
say
about
how
would
they
stop
said
prince
andrew
and
and
my
have
they
reached
moscow
at
he
asked
they
julie
drubetskaya
told
me
i
went
to
see
but
missed
they
have
gone
to
your
estate
near
chapter
xxv
the
officers
were
about
to
take
but
prince
apparently
reluctant
to
be
left
alone
with
his
asked
them
to
stay
and
have
seats
were
brought
in
and
so
was
the
the
officers
gazed
with
surprise
at
huge
stout
figure
and
listened
to
his
talk
of
moscow
and
the
position
of
our
round
which
he
had
prince
andrew
remained
and
his
expression
was
so
forbidding
that
pierre
addressed
his
remarks
chiefly
to
the
battalion
you
understand
the
whole
position
of
our
prince
andrew
interrupted
how
do
you
said
being
a
military
man
i
say
i
have
understood
it
but
i
understand
the
general
you
know
more
than
anyone
be
it
who
it
said
prince
said
looking
over
his
spectacles
in
perplexity
at
prince
and
what
do
you
think
of
he
was
very
glad
of
his
all
i
replied
prince
tell
me
your
opinion
of
barclay
de
in
moscow
they
are
saying
heaven
knows
what
about
what
do
you
think
of
replied
prince
indicating
the
pierre
looked
at
timokhin
with
the
condescendingly
interrogative
smile
with
which
everybody
involuntarily
addressed
that
see
light
since
his
serenity
has
been
your
said
timokhin
and
continually
turning
to
glance
at
his
asked
to
mention
only
firewood
and
let
me
inform
when
we
were
retreating
from
sventsyani
we
dare
not
touch
a
stick
or
a
wisp
of
hay
or
you
we
were
going
so
he
would
get
it
it
your
and
again
timokhin
turned
to
the
we
in
our
regiment
two
officers
were
for
that
kind
of
but
when
his
serenity
took
command
everything
became
straight
now
we
see
why
was
it
timokhin
looked
about
in
not
knowing
what
or
how
to
answer
such
a
pierre
put
the
same
question
to
prince
so
as
not
to
lay
waste
the
country
we
were
abandoning
to
the
said
prince
andrew
with
venomous
is
very
one
permit
the
land
to
be
pillaged
and
accustom
the
troops
to
at
smolensk
too
he
judged
correctly
that
the
french
might
outflank
as
they
had
larger
but
he
could
not
understand
cried
prince
andrew
in
a
shrill
voice
that
seemed
to
escape
him
could
not
understand
that
for
the
first
we
were
fighting
for
russian
and
that
there
was
a
spirit
in
the
men
such
as
i
had
never
seen
that
we
had
held
the
french
for
two
and
that
that
success
had
increased
our
strength
he
ordered
us
to
and
all
our
efforts
and
losses
went
for
he
had
no
thought
of
betraying
he
tried
to
do
the
best
he
he
thought
out
and
that
is
why
he
is
he
is
unsuitable
just
because
he
plans
out
everything
very
thoroughly
and
accurately
as
every
german
has
how
can
i
say
your
father
has
a
german
and
he
is
a
splendid
valet
and
satisfies
your
requirements
better
than
you
then
all
right
to
let
him
but
if
your
father
is
mortally
sick
send
the
valet
away
and
attend
to
your
father
with
your
own
awkward
and
will
soothe
him
better
than
a
skilled
man
who
is
a
stranger
so
it
has
been
with
while
russia
was
a
foreigner
could
serve
her
and
be
a
splendid
but
as
soon
as
she
is
in
danger
she
needs
one
of
her
own
but
in
your
club
they
have
been
making
him
out
a
they
slander
him
as
a
and
the
only
result
will
be
that
ashamed
of
their
false
they
will
make
him
out
a
hero
or
a
genius
instead
of
a
and
that
will
be
still
more
he
is
an
honest
and
very
punctilious
they
say
a
skillful
rejoined
understand
what
is
meant
by
skillful
replied
prince
andrew
skillful
replied
one
who
foresees
all
and
foresees
the
said
prince
andrew
as
if
it
were
a
matter
settled
long
pierre
looked
at
him
in
yet
they
say
that
war
is
like
a
game
of
he
replied
prince
with
this
little
that
in
chess
you
may
think
over
each
move
as
long
as
you
please
and
are
not
limited
for
and
with
this
difference
that
a
knight
is
always
stronger
than
a
and
two
pawns
are
always
stronger
than
while
in
war
a
battalion
is
sometimes
stronger
than
a
division
and
sometimes
weaker
than
a
the
relative
strength
of
bodies
of
troops
can
never
be
known
to
believe
he
went
things
depended
on
arrangements
made
by
the
i
should
be
there
making
but
instead
of
that
i
have
the
honor
to
serve
here
in
the
regiment
with
these
and
i
consider
that
on
us
battle
will
depend
and
not
on
those
success
never
and
never
will
on
or
or
even
on
and
least
of
all
on
on
what
the
feeling
that
is
in
me
and
in
he
pointed
to
in
each
prince
andrew
glanced
at
who
looked
at
his
commander
in
alarm
and
in
contrast
to
his
former
reticent
taciturnity
prince
andrew
now
seemed
he
could
apparently
not
refrain
from
expressing
the
thoughts
that
had
suddenly
occurred
to
battle
is
won
by
those
who
firmly
resolve
to
win
why
did
we
lose
the
battle
at
the
french
losses
were
almost
equal
to
but
very
early
we
said
to
ourselves
that
we
were
losing
the
and
we
did
lose
and
we
said
so
because
we
had
nothing
to
fight
for
we
wanted
to
get
away
from
the
battlefield
as
soon
as
we
so
let
us
and
we
if
we
had
not
said
that
till
the
heaven
knows
what
might
not
have
but
tomorrow
we
say
you
talk
about
our
the
left
flank
weak
and
the
right
flank
too
he
went
all
nothing
of
the
but
what
awaits
us
a
hundred
million
most
diverse
chances
which
will
be
decided
on
the
instant
by
the
fact
that
our
men
or
theirs
run
or
do
not
and
that
this
man
or
that
man
is
but
all
that
is
being
done
at
present
is
only
the
fact
is
that
those
men
with
whom
you
have
ridden
round
the
position
not
only
do
not
help
but
they
are
only
concerned
with
their
own
petty
such
a
said
pierre
such
a
prince
andrew
them
it
is
only
a
moment
affording
opportunities
to
undermine
a
rival
and
obtain
an
extra
cross
or
for
me
tomorrow
means
a
russian
army
of
a
hundred
thousand
and
a
french
army
of
a
hundred
thousand
have
met
to
and
the
thing
is
that
these
two
hundred
thousand
men
will
fight
and
the
side
that
fights
more
fiercely
and
spares
itself
least
will
and
if
you
like
i
will
tell
you
that
whatever
happens
and
whatever
muddles
those
at
the
top
may
we
shall
win
happen
what
we
shall
your
the
the
real
said
would
spare
himself
the
soldiers
in
my
believe
drink
their
not
the
day
for
they
all
were
the
officers
prince
andrew
went
out
of
the
shed
with
giving
final
orders
to
the
after
they
had
gone
pierre
approached
prince
andrew
and
was
about
to
start
a
conversation
when
they
heard
the
clatter
of
three
hoofs
on
the
road
not
far
from
the
and
looking
in
that
direction
prince
andrew
recognized
wolzogen
and
clausewitz
accompanied
by
a
they
rode
close
by
continuing
to
and
prince
andrew
involuntarily
heard
these
krieg
muss
in
raum
verlegt

ich
nicht
genug
preis
said
one
of
war
must
be
extended
i
cannot
sufficiently
commend
that
said
the
zweck
ist
nur
den

so
kann
man
gewiss
nicht
den
verlust

in
achtung
the
only
aim
is
to
weaken
the
so
of
course
one
cannot
take
into
account
the
loss
of
private
agreed
the
said
prince
andrew
with
an
angry
when
they
had
ridden
that
were
my
and
at
bald
all
the
same
to
what
i
was
saying
to
those
german
gentlemen
win
the
battle
tomorrow
but
will
only
make
all
the
mess
they
because
they
have
nothing
in
their
german
heads
but
theories
not
worth
an
empty
eggshell
and
in
their
hearts
the
one
thing
needed
which
timokhin
they
have
yielded
up
all
europe
to
and
have
now
come
to
teach
fine
and
again
his
voice
grew
you
think
we
shall
win
asked
answered
prince
andrew
thing
i
would
do
if
i
had
the
he
began
would
not
take
why
take
the
french
have
destroyed
my
home
and
are
on
their
way
to
destroy
they
have
outraged
and
are
outraging
me
every
they
are
my
in
my
opinion
they
are
all
and
so
thinks
timokhin
and
the
whole
they
should
be
since
they
are
my
foes
they
cannot
be
my
whatever
may
have
been
said
at
muttered
looking
with
shining
eyes
at
prince
quite
agree
with
the
question
that
had
perturbed
pierre
on
the
mozhaysk
hill
and
all
that
day
now
seemed
to
him
quite
clear
and
completely
he
now
understood
the
whole
meaning
and
importance
of
this
war
and
of
the
impending
all
he
had
seen
that
all
the
significant
and
stern
expressions
on
the
faces
he
had
seen
in
were
lit
up
for
him
by
a
new
he
understood
that
latent
heat
they
say
in
of
patriotism
which
was
present
in
all
these
men
he
had
and
this
explained
to
him
why
they
all
prepared
for
death
and
as
it
were
take
prince
andrew
by
itself
would
quite
change
the
whole
war
and
make
it
less
as
it
is
we
have
played
at
we
play
at
magnanimity
and
all
that
such
magnanimity
and
sensibility
are
like
the
magnanimity
and
sensibility
of
a
lady
who
faints
when
she
sees
a
calf
being
she
is
so
kindhearted
that
she
look
at
but
enjoys
eating
the
calf
served
up
with
they
talk
to
us
of
the
rules
of
of
of
flags
of
of
mercy
to
the
unfortunate
and
so
all
i
saw
chivalry
and
flags
of
truce
in
they
humbugged
us
and
we
humbugged
they
plunder
other
issue
false
paper
and
worst
of
all
they
kill
my
children
and
my
and
then
talk
of
rules
of
war
and
magnanimity
to
take
no
but
kill
and
be
he
who
has
come
to
this
as
i
have
through
the
same
prince
who
had
thought
it
was
all
the
same
to
him
whether
or
not
moscow
was
taken
as
smolensk
had
was
suddenly
checked
in
his
speech
by
an
unexpected
cramp
in
his
he
paced
up
and
down
a
few
times
in
but
his
eyes
glittered
feverishly
and
his
lips
quivered
as
he
began
there
was
none
of
this
magnanimity
in
we
should
go
to
war
only
when
it
was
worth
while
going
to
certain
as
then
there
would
not
be
war
because
paul
ivanovich
had
offended
michael
and
when
there
was
a
like
this
it
would
be
and
then
the
determination
of
the
troops
would
be
quite
then
all
these
westphalians
and
hessians
whom
napoleon
is
leading
would
not
follow
him
into
and
we
should
not
go
to
fight
in
austria
and
prussia
without
knowing
war
is
not
courtesy
but
the
most
horrible
thing
in
and
we
ought
to
understand
that
and
not
play
at
we
ought
to
accept
this
terrible
necessity
sternly
and
it
all
lies
in
get
rid
of
falsehood
and
let
war
be
war
and
not
a
as
it
is
war
is
the
favorite
pastime
of
the
idle
and
the
military
calling
is
the
most
highly
what
is
what
is
needed
for
success
in
what
are
the
habits
of
the
the
aim
of
war
is
the
methods
of
war
are
and
their
the
ruin
of
a
robbing
them
or
stealing
to
provision
the
and
fraud
and
falsehood
termed
military
the
habits
of
the
military
class
are
the
absence
of
that
and
and
in
spite
of
all
this
it
is
the
highest
respected
by
all
the
except
the
wear
military
and
he
who
kills
most
people
receives
the
highest
as
we
shall
meet
to
murder
one
they
kill
and
maim
tens
of
and
then
have
thanksgiving
services
for
having
killed
so
many
people
even
exaggerate
the
and
they
announce
a
supposing
that
the
more
people
they
have
killed
the
greater
their
how
does
god
above
look
at
them
and
hear
exclaimed
prince
andrew
in
a
piercing
my
it
has
of
late
become
hard
for
me
to
i
see
that
i
have
begun
to
understand
too
and
it
do
for
man
to
taste
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
of
good
and
not
for
he
and
time
for
me
to
go
back
to
said
prince
andrew
pierre
looking
at
prince
andrew
with
compassionate
before
a
battle
one
must
have
sleep
repeated
prince
he
came
quickly
up
to
pierre
and
embraced
and
kissed
be
he
we
meet
again
or
and
turning
away
hurriedly
he
entered
the
it
was
already
and
pierre
could
not
make
out
whether
the
expression
of
prince
face
was
angry
or
for
some
time
he
stood
in
silence
considering
whether
he
should
follow
him
or
go
he
does
not
want
pierre
i
know
that
this
is
our
last
he
sighed
deeply
and
rode
back
to
on
the
shed
prince
andrew
lay
down
on
a
but
he
could
not
he
closed
his
one
picture
succeeded
another
in
his
on
one
of
them
he
dwelt
long
and
he
vividly
recalled
an
evening
in
natasha
with
animated
and
excited
face
was
telling
him
how
she
had
gone
to
look
for
mushrooms
the
previous
summer
and
had
lost
her
way
in
the
big
she
incoherently
described
the
depths
of
the
her
and
a
talk
with
a
beekeeper
she
and
constantly
interrupted
her
story
to
i
not
telling
it
you
though
he
encouraged
her
by
saying
that
he
did
and
he
really
had
understood
all
she
wanted
to
but
natasha
was
not
satisfied
with
her
own
she
felt
that
they
did
not
convey
the
passionately
poetic
feeling
she
had
experienced
that
day
and
wished
to
was
such
a
delightful
old
and
it
was
so
dark
in
the
and
he
had
such
i
describe
she
had
flushed
and
prince
andrew
smiled
now
the
same
happy
smile
as
then
when
he
had
looked
into
her
understood
he
not
only
understood
but
it
was
just
that
spiritual
that
that
frankness
of
that
very
soul
of
hers
which
seemed
to
be
fettered
by
her
was
that
soul
i
loved
in
loved
so
strongly
and
and
suddenly
he
remembered
how
his
love
had
did
not
need
anything
of
that
he
neither
saw
nor
understood
anything
of
the
he
only
saw
in
her
a
pretty
and
fresh
young
with
whom
he
did
not
deign
to
unite
his
and
and
he
is
still
alive
and
prince
andrew
jumped
up
as
if
someone
had
burned
and
again
began
pacing
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
chapter

a

for
the

entered
the

he
began
opening

not

left
his
bedroom

was
finishing
his
slightly
snorting
and
he
presented
now
his
back
and
now
his
plump
hairy
chest
to
the
brush
with
which
his
valet
was
rubbing
him

with
his
finger
over
the
mouth
of

sprinkling
eau
de

on
the
pampered

an

seemed
to

that

to

busily
engaged

had
brought
from
the

two
chairs
directly
in

dressed
and
come
out
with
such
unexpected
rapidity
that
he
had
not

to
finish

at
once
what
they
were
about

guessed
that

not

pleasure
of

he
pretended
not
to

called
fabvier
to
listening
silently

with
a
stern
frown
to
what
fabvier
told
him
of
the
heroism
and
devotion
of

shook
his
head

communicating
to

generals
around
him
the
profound
course
of
ideas
which
guided
his
decisions
merely
gave
them
his

conclusions
in

listened
to

suggestion
from
who

disorder

opposite

a
little
in
silence

then
indicated
the

it

this
was
not

could
not

during

whole
battle
napoleon
was
so
far
away
as
appeared

orders

chapter

many
historians
say
that
the
french
did
not
win
the
battle
of
borodino
because
napoleon
had
a
and
that
if
he
had
not
had
a
cold
the
orders
he
gave
before
and
during
the
battle
would
have
been
still
more
full
of
genius
and
russia
would
have
been
lost
and
the
face
of
the
world
have
been
to
historians
who
believe
that
russia
was
shaped
by
the
will
of
one
the
that
france
from
a
republic
became
an
empire
and
french
armies
went
to
russia
at
the
will
of
one
say
that
russia
remained
a
power
because
napoleon
had
a
bad
cold
on
the
of
august
may
seem
logical
and
if
it
had
depended
on
will
to
fight
or
not
to
fight
the
battle
of
and
if
this
or
that
other
arrangement
depended
on
his
then
evidently
a
cold
affecting
the
manifestation
of
his
will
might
have
saved
and
consequently
the
valet
who
omitted
to
bring
napoleon
his
waterproof
boots
on
the
would
have
been
the
savior
of
along
that
line
of
thought
such
a
deduction
is
as
indubitable
as
the
deduction
voltaire
made
in
jest
knowing
what
he
was
jesting
when
he
saw
that
the
massacre
of
bartholomew
was
due
to
charles
stomach
being
but
to
men
who
do
not
admit
that
russia
was
formed
by
the
will
of
one
peter
or
that
the
french
empire
was
formed
and
the
war
with
russia
begun
by
the
will
of
one
that
argument
seems
not
merely
untrue
and
but
contrary
to
all
human
to
the
question
of
what
causes
historic
events
another
answer
presents
that
the
course
of
human
events
is
predetermined
from
on
depends
on
the
coincidence
of
the
wills
of
all
who
take
part
in
the
and
that
a
influence
on
the
course
of
these
events
is
purely
external
and
strange
as
at
first
glance
it
may
seem
to
suppose
that
the
massacre
of
bartholomew
was
not
due
to
charles
though
he
gave
the
order
for
it
and
thought
it
was
done
as
a
result
of
that
and
strange
as
it
may
seem
to
suppose
that
the
slaughter
of
eighty
thousand
men
at
borodino
was
not
due
to
though
he
ordered
the
commencement
and
conduct
of
the
battle
and
thought
it
was
done
because
he
ordered
strange
as
these
suppositions
yet
human
which
tells
me
that
each
of
us
if
not
more
at
least
not
less
a
man
than
the
great
the
acceptance
of
that
solution
of
the
and
historic
investigation
abundantly
confirms
at
the
battle
of
borodino
napoleon
shot
at
no
one
and
killed
no
that
was
all
done
by
the
therefore
it
was
not
he
who
killed
the
french
soldiers
went
to
kill
and
be
killed
at
the
battle
of
borodino
not
because
of
orders
but
by
their
own
the
whole
and
and
weary
of
the
felt
at
the
sight
of
an
army
blocking
their
road
to
moscow
that
the
wine
was
drawn
and
must
be
had
napoleon
then
forbidden
them
to
fight
the
they
would
have
killed
him
and
have
proceeded
to
fight
the
russians
because
it
was
when
they
heard
proclamation
offering
as
compensation
for
mutilation
and
the
words
of
posterity
about
their
having
been
in
the
battle
before
they
cried
just
as
they
had
cried
at
the
sight
of
the
portrait
of
the
boy
piercing
the
terrestrial
globe
with
a
toy
and
just
as
they
would
have
cried
at
any
nonsense
that
might
be
told
there
was
nothing
left
for
them
to
do
but
cry
and
go
to
in
order
to
get
food
and
rest
as
conquerors
in
so
it
was
not
because
of
commands
that
they
killed
their
fellow
and
it
was
not
napoleon
who
directed
the
course
of
the
for
none
of
his
orders
were
executed
and
during
the
battle
he
did
not
know
what
was
going
on
before
so
the
way
in
which
these
people
killed
one
another
was
not
decided
by
will
but
occurred
independently
of
in
accord
with
the
will
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
who
took
part
in
the
common
it
only
seemed
to
napoleon
that
it
all
took
place
by
his
and
so
the
question
whether
he
had
or
had
not
a
cold
has
no
more
historic
interest
than
the
cold
of
the
least
of
the
transport
the
assertion
made
by
various
writers
that
his
cold
was
the
cause
of
his
dispositions
not
being
as
as
on
former
and
of
his
orders
during
the
battle
not
being
as
good
as
is
quite
which
again
shows
that
cold
on
the
of
august
was
the
dispositions
cited
above
are
not
at
all
but
are
even
than
previous
dispositions
by
which
he
had
won
his
orders
during
the
battle
were
also
no
worse
than
but
much
the
same
as
these
dispositions
and
orders
only
seem
worse
than
previous
ones
because
the
battle
of
borodino
was
the
first
napoleon
did
not
the
profoundest
and
most
excellent
dispositions
and
orders
seem
very
and
every
learned
militarist
criticizes
them
with
looks
of
when
they
relate

the
just
bursting
forth
from
behind
a
cloud
that

concealed

with
rays
still
half
broken
by

over

down

street
to
the
knoll
from
which
he
had
looked
at
the
field
of

the
day
a
crowd
of
military
men
was
assembled
members
of
the
staff
could
be
heard
conversing
in
and
gray
head
in
a
white
cap
with

red
band

his
gray
nape
sunk
between

was
looking
through
a
field
glass
down
the
highroad
before
mounting
the
steps
to
the
knoll
pierre
looked
at
the
scene
before
spellbound
by
it
was
the
same
panorama
he
had
admired
from
that
spot
the
day
but
now
the
whole
place
was
full
of
troops
and
covered
by
smoke
clouds
from
the
and
the
slanting
rays
of
the
bright
rising
slightly
to
the
left
behind
cast
upon
it
through
the
clear
morning
air
penetrating
streaks
of
light
and
long
dark
the
forest
at
the
farthest
extremity
of
the
panorama
seemed
carved
in
some
precious
stone
of
a
its
undulating
outline
was
silhouetted
against
the
horizon
and
was
pierced
beyond
valuevo
by
the
smolensk
highroad
crowded
with
nearer
at
hand
glittered
golden
cornfields
interspersed
with
there
were
troops
to
be
seen
in
front
and
to
the
right
and
all
this
was
and
but
what
impressed
pierre
most
of
all
was
the
view
of
the
battlefield
of
borodino
and
the
hollows
on
both
sides
of
the
above
the
in
borodino
and
on
both
sides
of
especially
to
the
left
where
the
voyna
flowing
between
its
marshy
banks
falls
into
the
a
mist
had
spread
which
seemed
to
to
and
to
become
translucent
when
the
brilliant
sun
appeared
and
magically
colored
and
outlined
the
smoke
of
the
guns
mingled
with
this
and
over
the
whole
expanse
and
through
that
mist
the
rays
of
the
morning
sun
were
flashing
back
like
lightning
from
the
from
the
and
from
the
bayonets
of
the
troops
crowded
together
by
the
riverbanks
and
in
a
white
church
could
be
seen
through
the
and
here
and
there
the
roofs
of
huts
in
borodino
as
well
as
dense
masses
of
or
green
ammunition
chests
and
and
all
this
or
seemed
to
as
the
smoke
and
mist
spread
out
over
the
whole
just
as
in
the
hollow
near
so
along
the
entire
line
outside
and
above
it
and
especially
in
the
woods
and
fields
to
the
in
the
valleys
and
on
the
summits
of
the
high
clouds
of
powder
smoke
seemed
continually
to
spring
up
out
of
now
now
several
at
a
some
others
and
extended
over
the
whole
these
puffs
of
smoke
and
to
the
sound
of
the
firing
produced
the
chief
beauty
of
the
a
round
compact
cloud
of
smoke
was
seen
merging
from
violet
into
gray
and
milky
and
came
the
report
a
second
two
clouds
arose
pushing
one
another
and
blending
and
came
the
sounds
confirming
what
the
eye
had
pierre
glanced
round
at
the
first
which
he
had
seen
as
a
round
compact
and
in
its
place
already
were
balloons
of
smoke
floating
to
one
a
three
and
then
four
more
appeared
and
then
from
with
the
same
came
the
precise
sounds
in
it
seemed
as
if
those
smoke
clouds
sometimes
ran
and
sometimes
stood
still
while
and
glittering
bayonets
ran
past
from
the
over
fields
and
those
large
balls
of
smoke
were
continually
appearing
followed
by
their
solemn
while
nearer
in
the
hollows
and
there
burst
from
the
muskets
small
cloudlets
that
had
no
time
to
become
but
had
their
little
echoes
in
just
the
same
came
the
frequent
crackle
of
but
it
was
irregular
and
feeble
in
comparison
with
the
reports
of
the
pierre

to
be
there
with

those

turned
to
look
at

his
impressions
with

of

were
all
looking
at
the
field
of

he

it
seemed
to

the

all
their
faces
were
now
shining
with
that
latent
warmth
of
feeling

before

had
fully
understood

his
talk

saying
to
a

turning

his

against

sides

that

spectacles
were
slipping
off
but
unable
to
let
go

galloped
after

the

to

as
they
watched
him

but
there
were
soldiers
all
with
the

preoccupied
expression
and
busy
with
some
unseen
but
evidently
important
they
all
gazed
with
the
same
dissatisfied
and
inquiring
expression
at
this
stout
man
in
a
white
who
for
some
unknown
reason

to

was
a

attacking

the
first
phase
of
the

that
there
was
a
bridge
in
front
of
him
and
that
soldiers
were
doing
something
on
both
sides
of
it
and
in
the
among
the
rows
of
hay
which
he
had
taken
no
notice
of
amid
the
smoke
of
the
campfires
the
day
but
despite
the
incessant
firing
going
on
there
he
had
no
idea
that
this
was

not

bullets
whistling
from

over

on
the

side

for
a
long
time
did
not
notice
the
killed

though
many
fell
near

about
him
with
a
smile

angrily
at

on
recognizing

went
to
the
battery
and
the
adjutant
rode
they
did
not
meet
and
only
much
later
did
pierre
learn
that
he
lost
an
arm
that
the
knoll
to
which
pierre
ascended
was
that
famous
one
afterwards
known
to
the
russians
as
the
knoll
battery
or
and
to
the
french
as
la
grande
la
fatale
la
redoute
du
around
which
tens
of
thousands
and
which
the
french
regarded
as
the
key
to
the
whole
this
redoubt
consisted
of
a
on
three
sides
of
which
trenches
had
been
within
the
entrenchment
stood
ten
guns
that
were
being
fired
through
openings
in
the
in
line
with
the
knoll
on
both
sides
stood
other
guns
which
also
fired
a
little
behind
the
guns
stood
when
ascending
that
knoll
pierre
had
no
notion
that
this
on
which
small
trenches
had
been
dug
and
from
which
a
few
guns
were
was
the
most
important
point
of
the
on
the
just
because
he
happened
to
be
there
he
thought
it
one
of
the
least
significant
parts
of
the
having
reached
the
pierre
sat
down
at
one
end
of
a
trench
surrounding
the
battery
and
gazed
at
what
was
going
on
around
him
with
an
unconsciously
happy
occasionally
he
rose
and
walked
about
the
battery
still
with
that
same
trying
not
to
obstruct
the
soldiers
who
were
hauling
the
and
continually
running
past
him
with
bags
and
the
guns
of
that
battery
were
being
fired
continually
one
after
another
with
a
deafening
enveloping
the
whole
neighborhood
in
powder
in
contrast
with
the
dread
felt
by
the
infantrymen
placed
in
here
in
the
battery
where
a
small
number
of
men
busy
at
their
work
were
separated
from
the
rest
by
a
everyone
experienced
a
common
and
as
it
were
family
feeling
of
the
intrusion
of
nonmilitary
figure
in
a
white
hat
made
an
unpleasant
impression
at
the
soldiers
looked
askance
at
him
with
surprise
and
even
alarm
as
they
went
past
the
senior
artillery
a
pockmarked
moved
over
to
pierre
as
if
to
see
the
action
of
the
farthest
gun
and
looked
at
him
with
a
young
quite
a
boy
still
and
evidently
only
just
out
of
the
cadet
who
was
zealously
commanding
the
two
guns

the
soldiers
shook
their
heads
disapprovingly
as
they
looked
at
but
when
they
had
convinced
themselves
that
this
man
in
the
white
hat
was
doing
no
but
either
sat
quietly
on
the
slope
of
the
trench
with
a
shy
smile
politely
making
way
for
the
paced
up
and
down
the
battery
under

as
calmly
as
if
he
were
on
a
their
feeling
of
hostile
distrust
gradually
began
to
change
into
a
kindly
and
bantering
such
as
soldiers
feel
for
their
and
in
general
for
the
animals
that
live
with
the
the

accepted

him
a
nickname
and
made
kindly
fun
of
him
among
a
shell
tore
up
the
earth
two
paces
from
pierre
and
he
looked
around
with
a
smile
as
he
brushed
from
his
clothes

earth

had
thrown

the

round
the
young
officer

evidently
exercising
his
duties
for
the
first
or
second
time
and
therefore
treated
both
his
superiors
and
the
men
with
great
precision
and
the
booming
cannonade
and
the
fusillade
of
musketry
were
growing
more
intense
over
the
whole
especially
to
the
left
where
fleches

where
pierre
was
the
smoke
of
the
firing
made
it
almost
impossible
to

was
engrossed

animation

turned
as
if

were
examining
something
down

that
one
of

had
noticed
before

struggling

trying
to
free
himself
from
some
men

were
holding
him
by

also
saw
something
else
that
was

he
had
not

been
that
the

shouting
was
a

that
another

bayoneted
in

the

ever
tighter

artless

on

cannonade
from

with

standing
the
fleches
were
two

of

it
was
more
than
a
mile
as
the
crow
flies
to

that

not

be

had
descended
into

the

risen

slanting
rays
struck

into

looked
at

out

times
it
looked

times
as
if
the
troops
sometimes
shouts
were
heard
through
the
but
it
was
impossible
to
tell
what
was
being
done
standing
on
the
looked
through
a
field
and
in
its
small
circlet
saw
smoke
and
sometimes
his
own
and
sometimes
but
when
he
looked
again
with
the
naked
he
could
not
tell
where
what
he
had
seen
he
descended
the
knoll
and
began
walking
up
and
down
before
occasionally
he
listened
to
the
and
gazed
intently
at
the
but
not
only
was
it
impossible
to
make
out
what
was
happening
from
where
he
was
standing
down
or
from
the
knoll
above
on
which
some
of
his
generals
had
taken
their
but
even
from
the
fleches
which
by
this
time
there
were
now
russian
and
now
french
alternately
or
or
even
at
those
fleches
themselves
it
was
impossible
to
make
out
what
was
taking
there
for
several
hours
amid
incessant
cannon
and
musketry
now
russians
were
seen
now
frenchmen
now
and
now
they
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
one
and
ran
back
from
the
battlefield
adjutants
he
had
sent
and
orderlies
from
his
kept
galloping
up
to
napoleon
with
reports
of
the
progress
of
the
but
all
these
reports
were
both
because
it
was
impossible
in
the
heat
of
battle
to
say
what
was
happening
at
any
given
moment
and
because
many
of
the
adjutants
did
not
go
to
the
actual
place
of
conflict
but
reported
what
they
had
heard
from
and
also
because
while
an
adjutant
was
riding
more
than
a
mile
to
napoleon
circumstances
changed
and
the
news
he
brought
was
already
becoming
thus
an
adjutant
galloped
up
from
murat
with
tidings
that
borodino
had
been
occupied
and
the
bridge
over
the
kolocha
was
in
the
hands
of
the
the
adjutant
asked
whether
napoleon
wished
the
troops
to
cross
napoleon
gave
orders
that
the
troops
should
form
up
on
the
farther
side
and
but
before
that
order
was
as
soon
in
fact
as
the
adjutant
had
left
bridge
had
been
retaken
by
the
russians
and
in
the
very
skirmish
at
which
pierre
had
been
present
at
the
beginning
of
the
an
adjutant
galloped
up
from
the
fleches
with
a
pale
and
frightened
face
and
reported
to
napoleon
that
their
attack
had
been
campan
and
davout
yet
at
the
very
time
the
adjutant
had
been
told
that
the
french
had
been
the
fleches
had
in
fact
been
recaptured
by
other
french
and
davout
was
alive
and
only
slightly
on
the
basis
of
these
necessarily
untrustworthy
reports
napoleon
gave
his
which
had
either
been
executed
before
he
gave
them
or
could
not
be
and
were
not
the
marshals
and
who
were
nearer
to
the
field
of
battle
like
did
not
take
part
in
the
actual
fighting
and
only
occasionally
went
within
musket
made
their
own
arrangements
without
asking
napoleon
and
issued
orders
where
and
in
what
direction
to
fire
and
where
cavalry
should
gallop
and
infantry
should
but
even
their
like
were
seldom
carried
and
then
but
for
the
most
part
things
happened
contrary
to
their
soldiers
ordered
to
advance
ran
back
on
meeting
soldiers
ordered
to
remain
where
they
seeing
russians
unexpectedly
before
sometimes
rushed
back
and
sometimes
and
the
cavalry
dashed
without
orders
in
pursuit
of
the
flying
in
this
way
two
cavalry
regiments
galloped
through
the
semenovsk
hollow
and
as
soon
as
they
reached
the
top
of
the
incline
turned
round
and
galloped
full
speed
back
the
infantry
moved
in
the
same
sometimes
running
to
quite
other
places
than
those
they
were
ordered
to
go
all
orders
as
to
where
and
when
to
move
the
when
to
send
infantry
to
shoot
or
horsemen
to
ride
down
the
russian
such
orders
were
given
by
the
officers
on
the
spot
nearest
to
the
units
without
asking
either
or
much
less
they
did
not
fear
getting
into
trouble
for
not
fulfilling
orders
or
for
acting
on
their
own
for
in
battle
what
is
at
stake
is
what
is
dearest
to
own
it
sometimes
seems
that
safety
lies
in
running
sometimes
in
running
and
these
men
who
were
right
in
the
heat
of
the
battle
acted
according
to
the
mood
of
the
in
all
these
movements
forward
and
backward
did
not
improve
or
alter
the
position
of
the
all
their
rushing
and
galloping
at
one
another
did
little
the
harm
of
disablement
and
death
was
caused
by
the
balls
and
bullets
that
flew
over
the
fields
on
which
these
men
were
floundering
as
soon
as
they
left
the
place
where
the
balls
and
bullets
were
flying
their
located
in
the
them
and
brought
them
under
discipline
and
under
the
influence
of
that
discipline
led
them
back
to
the
zone
of
where
under
the
influence
of
fear
of
death
they
lost
their
discipline
and
rushed
about
according
to
the
chance
promptings
of
the
chapter
xxxiv
and
who
were
near
that
region
of
fire
and
sometimes
even
entered
led
into
it
huge
masses
of
but
contrary
to
what
had
always
happened
in
their
former
instead
of
the
news
they
expected
of
the
these
orderly
masses
returned
thence
as
disorganized
and
terrified
the
generals
but
their
numbers
constantly
in
the
middle
of
the
day
murat
sent
his
adjutant
to
napoleon
to
demand
napoleon
sat
at
the
foot
of
the
drinking
when
adjutant
galloped
up
with
an
assurance
that
the
russians
would
be
routed
if
his
majesty
would
let
him
have
another
said
napoleon
in
a
tone
of
stern
looking
at
the
handsome
lad
with
long
black
curls
arranged
like
though
he
did
not
understand
his
thought
napoleon
to
can
they
need
reinforcements
when
they
already
have
half
the
army
directed
against
a
unentrenched
russian
the
king
of
said
he
it
is
not
noon
and
i
yet
see
my
chessboard
the
handsome
boy
adjutant
with
the
long
hair
sighed
deeply
without
removing
his
hand
from
his
hat
and
galloped
back
to
where
men
were
being
napoleon
rose
and
having
summoned
caulaincourt
and
berthier
began
talking
to
them
about
matters
unconnected
with
the
in
the
midst
of
this
which
was
beginning
to
interest
eyes
turned
to
look
at
a
general
with
a
who
was
galloping
toward
the
knoll
on
a
lathering
it
was
having
dismounted
he
went
up
to
the
emperor
with
rapid
strides
and
in
a
loud
voice
began
boldly
demonstrating
the
necessity
of
sending
he
swore
on
his
honor
that
the
russians
were
lost
if
the
emperor
would
give
another
napoleon
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
continued
to
pace
up
and
down
without
belliard
began
talking
loudly
and
eagerly
to
the
generals
of
the
suite
around
are
very
said
when
he
again
came
up
to
the
the
heat
of
a
battle
it
is
easy
to
make
a
go
and
have
another
look
and
then
come
back
to
before
belliard
was
out
of
a
messenger
from
another
part
of
the
battlefield
galloped
what
do
you
asked
napoleon
in
the
tone
of
a
man
irritated
at
being
continually
the
began
the
for
said
napoleon
with
an
angry
the
adjutant
bent
his
head
affirmatively
and
began
to
but
the
emperor
turned
from
took
a
couple
of
came
and
called
must
give
he
moving
his
arms
slightly
do
you
think
should
be
sent
he
asked
of
berthier
he
subsequently
termed
gosling
i
have
made
an
replied
who
knew
all
the
and
battalions
by
napoleon
nodded
the
adjutant
galloped
to
division
and
a
few
minutes
later
the
young
guards
stationed
behind
the
knoll
moved
napoleon
gazed
silently
in
that
he
suddenly
said
to
send
send
though
there
was
no
advantage
in
sending
division
instead
of
and
even
an
obvious
inconvenience
and
delay
in
stopping
claparede
and
sending
friant
the
order
was
carried
out
napoleon
did
not
notice
that
in
regard
to
his
army
he
was
playing
the
part
of
a
doctor
who
hinders
by
his
role
he
so
justly
understood
and
division
disappeared
as
the
others
had
done
into
the
smoke
of
the
from
all
sides
adjutants
continued
to
arrive
at
a
gallop
and
as
if
by
agreement
all
said
the
same
they
all
asked
for
reinforcements
and
all
said
that
the
russians
were
holding
their
positions
and
maintaining
a
hellish
fire
under
which
the
french
army
was
melting
napoleon
sat
on
a
wrapped
in
de
the
man
so
fond
of
having
fasted
since
came
up
to
the
emperor
and
ventured
respectfully
to
suggest
lunch
to
his
hope
i
may
now
congratulate
your
majesty
on
a
said
napoleon
silently
shook
his
head
in
assuming
the
negation
to
refer
only
to
the
victory
and
not
to
the
de
beausset
ventured
with
respectful
jocularity
to
remark
that
there
is
no
reason
for
not
having
lunch
when
one
can
get
exclaimed
napoleon
suddenly
and
and
turned
a
beatific
smile
of
and
ecstasy
beamed
on
de
face
and
he
glided
away
to
the
other
napoleon
was
experiencing
a
feeling
of
depression
like
that
of
an
lucky
gambler
after
recklessly
flinging
money
about
and
always
suddenly
just
when
he
has
calculated
all
the
chances
of
the
finds
that
the
more
he
considers
his
play
the
more
surely
he
his
troops
were
the
his
generals
the
the
same
preparations
had
been
the
same
and
the
same
proclamation
courte
et
he
himself
was
still
the
he
knew
that
and
knew
that
he
was
now
even
more
experienced
and
skillful
than
even
the
enemy
was
the
same
as
at
austerlitz
and
the
terrible
stroke
of
his
arm
had
supernaturally
become
all
the
old
methods
that
had
been
unfailingly
crowned
with
the
concentration
of
batteries
on
one
an
attack
by
reserves
to
break
the
and
a
cavalry
attack
by
men
of
all
these
methods
had
already
been
yet
not
only
was
there
no
but
from
all
sides
came
the
same
news
of
generals
killed
and
of
reinforcements
of
the
impossibility
of
driving
back
the
and
of
disorganization
among
his
own
after
he
had
given
two
or
three
orders
and
uttered
a
few
marshals
and
adjutants
had
come
galloping
up
with
congratulations
and
happy
announcing
the
trophies
the
corps
of
bundles
of
enemy
eagles
and
cannon
and
and
murat
had
only
begged
leave
to
loose
the
cavalry
to
gather
in
the
baggage
so
it
had
been
at
and
so
but
now
something
strange
was
happening
to
his
despite
news
of
the
capture
of
the
napoleon
saw
that
this
was
not
the
not
at
all
the
as
what
had
happened
in
his
former
he
saw
that
what
he
was
feeling
was
felt
by
all
the
men
about
him
experienced
in
the
art
of
all
their
faces
looked
and
they
all
shunned
one
a
de
beausset
could
fail
to
grasp
the
meaning
of
what
was
but
napoleon
with
his
long
experience
of
war
well
knew
the
meaning
of
a
battle
not
gained
by
the
attacking
side
in
eight
after
all
efforts
had
been
he
knew
that
it
was
a
lost
battle
and
that
the
least
accident
might
the
fight
balanced
on
such
a
strained
him
and
his
when
he
ran
his
mind
over
the
whole
of
this
strange
russian
campaign
in
which
not
one
battle
had
been
and
in
which
not
a
or
or
army
corps
had
been
captured
in
two
when
he
looked
at
the
concealed
depression
on
the
faces
around
him
and
heard
reports
of
the
russians
still
holding
their
terrible
feeling
like
a
nightmare
took
possession
of
and
all
the
unlucky
accidents
that
might
destroy
him
occurred
to
his
the
russians
might
fall
on
his
left
might
break
through
his
he
himself
might
be
killed
by
a
stray
cannon
all
this
was
in
former
battles
he
had
only
considered
the
possibilities
of
but
now
innumerable
unlucky
chances
presented
and
he
expected
them
it
was
like
a
dream
in
which
a
man
fancies
that
a
ruffian
is
coming
to
attack
and
raises
his
arm
to
strike
that
ruffian
a
terrible
blow
which
he
knows
should
annihilate
but
then
feels
that
his
arm
drops
powerless
and
limp
like
a
and
the
horror
of
unavoidable
destruction
seizes
him
in
his
the
news
that
the
russians
were
attacking
the
left
flank
of
the
french
army
aroused
that
horror
in
he
sat
silently
on
a
campstool
below
the
with
head
bowed
and
elbows
on
his
berthier
approached
and
suggested
that
they
should
ride
along
the
line
to
ascertain
the
position
of
what
do
you
asked
tell
them
to
bring
me
my
he
mounted
and
rode
toward
amid
the
powder
slowly
dispersing
over
the
whole
space
through
which
napoleon
horses
and
men
were
lying
in
pools
of
singly
or
in
neither
napoleon
nor
any
of
his
generals
had
ever
before
seen
such
horrors
or
so
many
slain
in
such
a
small
the
roar
of
that
had
not
ceased
for
ten
wearied
the
ear
and
gave
a
peculiar
significance
to
the
as
music
does
to
tableaux
napoleon
rode
up
the
high
ground
at
and
through
the
smoke
saw
ranks
of
men
in
uniforms
of
a
color
unfamiliar
to
they
were
the
russians
stood
in
serried
ranks
behind
semenovsk
village
and
its
and
their
guns
boomed
incessantly
along
their
line
and
sent
forth
clouds
of
it
was
no
longer
a
it
was
a
continuous
slaughter
which
could
be
of
no
avail
either
to
the
french
or
the
napoleon
stopped
his
horse
and
again
fell
into
the
reverie
from
which
berthier
had
aroused
he
could
not
stop
what
was
going
on
before
him
and
around
him
and
was
supposed
to
be
directed
by
him
and
to
depend
on
and
from
its
lack
of
success
this
for
the
first
seemed
to
him
unnecessary
and
one
of
the
generals
rode
up
to
napoleon
and
ventured
to
offer
to
lead
the
old
guard
into
ney
and
standing
near
exchanged
looks
and
smiled
contemptuously
at
this
senseless
napoleon
bowed
his
head
and
remained
silent
a
long
eight
hundred
leagues
from
i
will
not
have
my
guard
he
and
turning
his
horse
rode
back
to
chapter
xxxv
on
the
bench
where
pierre
had
seen
him
in
the
morning
sat
his
gray
head
his
heavy
body
he
gave
no
but
only
assented
to
or
dissented
from
what
others
do
he
replied
to
various
dear
and
have
a
he
would
say
to
one
or
another
of
those
about
better
he
listened
to
the
reports
that
were
brought
him
and
gave
directions
when
his
subordinates
demanded
that
of
but
when
listening
to
the
reports
it
seemed
as
if
he
were
not
interested
in
the
import
of
the
words
but
rather
in
something
the
expression
of
face
and
tone
of
voice
of
those
who
were
by
long
years
of
military
experience
he
and
with
the
wisdom
of
age
that
it
is
impossible
for
one
man
to
direct
hundreds
of
thousands
of
others
struggling
with
and
he
knew
that
the
result
of
a
battle
is
decided
not
by
the
orders
of
a
nor
the
place
where
the
troops
are
nor
by
the
number
of
cannon
or
of
slaughtered
but
by
that
intangible
force
called
the
spirit
of
the
and
he
watched
this
force
and
guided
it
in
as
far
as
that
was
in
his
general
expression
was
one
of
concentrated
quiet
and
his
face
wore
a
strained
look
as
if
he
found
it
difficult
to
master
the
fatigue
of
his
old
and
feeble
at
eleven
they
brought
him
news
that
the
fleches
captured
by
the
french
had
been
but
that
prince
bagration
was
kutuzov
groaned
and
swayed
his
over
to
prince
peter
ivanovich
and
find
out
about
it
he
said
to
one
of
his
and
then
turned
to
the
duke
of
wurttemberg
who
was
standing
behind
your
highness
please
take
command
of
the
first
soon
after
the
he
could
possibly
have
reached
adjutant
came
back
from
him
and
told
kutuzov
that
the
duke
asked
for
more
kutuzov
made
a
grimace
and
sent
an
order
to
dokhturov
to
take
over
the
command
of
the
first
and
a
request
to
the
he
said
he
could
not
spare
at
such
an
important
return
to
when
they
brought
him
news
that
murat
had
been
taken
and
the
staff
officers
congratulated
kutuzov
a
said
battle
is
and
there
is
nothing
extraordinary
in
the

the

sent
his
favorite
officer
to
the
commander
in

with
that
kutuzov
was
chewing
a
piece
of
roast
chicken
with
difficulty
and
glanced
at
wolzogen
with
eyes
that
brightened
under
their

stretching

kutuzov
with
a
smile
on
his
scarcely
touching

treated
his
serene
highness
with
a
somewhat
affected
nonchalance
intended
to
show
as
a
highly
trained
military
he
left
it
to
russians
to
make
an
idol
of
this
useless
old
but
that
he
knew

he
was
dealing
alte
in
their
own
set
the
germans
called
making
himself
very
thought
and
looking
severely
at
the
dishes
in
front
of
kutuzov
he
began
to
report
to
old
the
position
of
affairs
on
the
left
flank
as
barclay
had
ordered
him
to
and
as
he
himself
had
seen
and
understood
the
points
of
our
position
are
in
the
hands
and
we
cannot
dislodge
them
for
lack
of
the
men
are
running
away
and
it
is
impossible
to
stop
he
kutuzov
ceased
chewing
and
fixed
an
astonished
gaze
on

if

what
was
said

and
rising
he
went
up
to
how

he
choking
and
making
a
threatening
gesture
with
his
trembling
dare
say
that
to

know
nothing
about

from
me
that
his
information
is
incorrect

that
the

good
as

and
inform
him
of
my
firm
intention
to

kutuzov
all
were
and
the
only
sound
audible
was
the
heavy
breathing
of

i

ascending

was
who
had
spent
the
whole
day
at
the
most
important
part
of
the
field
of
raevski
reported
that
the
troops
were
firmly
holding
their
ground
and
that
the
french
no
longer
ventured
to

hearing
kutuzov
said
in
you
do
not
like

that
we
must

always
the
most
stubborn
who

replied
in

called
to
his
down
and
write
out
the
order
of
the
day
for

he
addressing
along
the
line
and
announce
that
tomorrow
we
while
kutuzov
was
talking
to
raevski
and
dictating
the
order
of
the
wolzogen
returned
from
barclay
and
said
that
general
barclay
wished
to
have
written
confirmation
of
the
order
the
field
marshal
had
without
looking
at
gave
directions
for
the
order
to
be
written
out
which
the
former
to
avoid
personal
very
judiciously
wished
to
and
by
means
of
that
mysterious
indefinable
bond
which
maintains
throughout
an
army

and
the

as

of

which
constitutes
the
sinew
of

from

end
of
the

to
the
it
was
far
from
being
the

words
or
the

order
that
reached
the
farthest
links
of
that
the
tales
passing
from
mouth
to
mouth
at
different
ends
of
the
army
did
not
even
resemble
what
kutuzov
had
but
the
sense
of
his
words
spread
everywhere
because
what
he
said
was
not
the
outcome
of
cunning
but
of
a
feeling
that
lay
in
the
soul
as
in
that
of
every
and
on
learning
that
tomorrow
they
were
to

into
a

oatfield
in
the
gap
between

and
the
knoll
where
thousands
of
men
perished
that
day
and
on
which
an
concentrated
fire
from
several
hundred
enemy
guns
was
directed
between
one
and
two
without
moving
from
that
spot
or
firing

lost

out

slow
whistling

flew
at

if
to
allow
them
a
a
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
during
which
the
cannon
balls
and
shells
all
flew
but
sometimes
several
men
were
torn
from
the
regiment
in
a
minute
and
the
slain
were
continually
being
dragged
away
and
the
wounded

each

blow
less
and
less
chance
of

remained
for
those

stood
in
columns
of
three
hundred
paces
but
nevertheless
the
men
were
always
in
one
and
the

alike
were
taciturn
and

was
rarely

in

built
little
houses

in

plaited
baskets
from

all
seemed
fully
absorbed
in
these
when

were
killed

when

of

some
troops
and
when
great
masses
of
the
enemy
came
into

through
the
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
these
but
when
our
artillery
or
cavalry
advanced
or
some
of
our
infantry
were
seen
to
move
words
of
approval
were
heard
on
all
but
the
liveliest
attention
was
attracted
by
occurrences
quite
apart
and
unconnected

it
was
as
if
the
minds
of
these
morally
exhausted
men
found
relief
in

at

identical
shouts
from
the
ranks
all
along

another
general
attention
was
attracted
by
a
small
brown
coming
heaven
knows
which
trotted
in
a
preoccupied
manner
in
front
of
the
ranks
with
tail
stiffly
erect
till
suddenly
a
shell
fell
close
when
it
tucked
its
tail
between
its

darted
yells
and
shrieks
of
laughter
rose
from
the
whole
but
such
distractions
lasted
only
a
and
for
eight
hours
the
men
had
been
without

constant
fear
of

their
pale
and
gloomy
faces
grew
ever
paler
and

pale
and
gloomy
like
everyone
in

up
and
down

the
border
of

edge
of

that

their

bitter
nothing

a
five
paces

up

a
chill
ran
down

glanced
at

the
having
obeyed

prince
from
the
other
side
a
battalion
commander
rode
came
a
frightened
cry
from
a
soldier
like
a
bird
whirring
in
rapid
flight
and
alighting
on
the
a
shell
dropped
with
little
noise
within
two
steps
of

close
to

at

that

were
looking

the
he

the

moment
came
the
sound
of

whistle
of
splinters

breaking
window

suffocating
smell
of

opened
his

for
a
long
time
could
not

his

about

above
the

of

evidently
wanted

turning
his
head
from
right
to

for
some

sighed
and
looked

replied
to
a
dresser
who
pointed
prince
andrew
out
to

them
to

him

that

in

laid
on
a
table
that

only
just
been
cleared

a
dresser
was
washing
prince
andrew
could
not
make
out
distinctly
what

the
pitiful
groans
from
all
sides
and
the
torturing
pain
in
his
and
back
distracted
all
he
saw
about
him
merged
into
a
general
impression
of
bleeding
human
bodies
that

to
fill
the
whole
of
the
low
as
a
few
weeks
on
that
hot
august
such
bodies
had
filled
the
dirty
pond
beside
the
smolensk
it
was
the
same
the
same
chair
a
the
sight
of
which
had
even
then
filled
him
with
as
by
a
there
were
three
operating
tables
in
the
two
were
and
on
the
third
they
placed
prince
for
a
little
while
he
was
left
alone
and
involuntarily
witnessed
what
was
taking
place
on
the
other
two
on
the
nearest
one
sat
a
probably
a
judging
by
the
uniform
thrown
down
beside
four
soldiers
were
holding
and
a
spectacled
doctor
was
cutting
into
his
muscular
brown
grunted
the
and
suddenly
lifting
up
his
swarthy
face
with
its
high
and
baring
his
white
he
began
to
wriggle
and
twitch
his
body
and
utter
and
prolonged
on
the
other
round
which
many
people
were
a
tall
man
lay
on
his
back
with
his
head
thrown
his
curly
its
and
the
shape
of
his
head
seemed
strangely
familiar
to
prince
several
dressers
were
pressing
on
his
chest
to
hold
him
one
plump
leg
twitched
rapidly
all
the
time
with
a
feverish
the
man
was
sobbing
and
choking
two
of
whom
was
pale
and
silently
doing
something
to
this
gory
when
he
had
finished
with
the
whom
they
covered
with
an
the
spectacled
doctor
came
up
to
prince
wiping
his
he
glanced
at
prince
face
and
quickly
turned
what
are
you
waiting
he
cried
angrily
to
the
his
very
remotest
recollections
of
childhood
came
back
to
prince
mind
when
the
dresser
with
sleeves
rolled
up
began
hastily
to
undo
the
buttons
of
his
clothes
and
undressed
the
doctor
bent
down
over
the
felt
and
sighed
then
he
made
a
sign
to
and
the
torturing
pain
in
his
abdomen
caused
prince
andrew
to
lose
when
he
came
to
himself
the
splintered
portions
of
his
thighbone
had
been
the
torn
flesh
cut
and
the
wound
water
was
being
sprinkled
on
his
as
soon
as
prince
andrew
opened
his
the
doctor
bent
kissed
him
silently
on
the
and
hurried
after
the
sufferings
he
had
been
prince
andrew
enjoyed
a
blissful
feeling
such
as
he
had
not
experienced
for
a
long
all
the
best
and
happiest
moments
of
his
his
earliest
when
he
used
to
be
undressed
and
put
to
and
when
leaning
over
him
his
nurse
sang
him
to
sleep
and
burying
his
head
in
the
felt
happy
in
the
mere
consciousness
of
to
his
not
merely
as
something
past
but
as
something
the
doctors
were
busily
engaged
with
the
wounded
man
the
shape
of
whose
head
seemed
familiar
to
prince
they
were
lifting
him
up
and
trying
to
quiet
it
to
his
frightened
moans
could
be
subdued
by
suffering
and
broken
by
hearing
those
moans
prince
andrew
wanted
to
whether
because
he
was
dying
without
or
because
he
was
sorry
to
part
with
or
because
of
those
memories
of
a
childhood
that
could
not
or
because
he
was
suffering
and
others
were
suffering
and
that
man
near
him
was
groaning
so
felt
like
weeping
and
almost
happy
the
wounded
man
was
shown
his
amputated
leg
stained
with
clotted
blood
and
with
the
boot
still
he
like
a
the
doctor
who
had
been
standing
beside
preventing
prince
andrew
from
seeing
his
moved
what
is
why
is

said
prince
andrew
to
in
the
enfeebled
man
whose
leg
had
just
been
he
recognized
anatole
men
were
supporting
him
in
their
arms
and
offering
him
a
glass
of
but
his
swollen
lips
could
not
grasp
its
anatole
was
sobbing
it
is
that
man
is
somehow
closely
and
painfully
connected
with
thought
prince
not
yet
clearly
grasping
what
he
saw
before
is
the
connection
of
that
man
with
my
childhood
and
he
asked
himself
without
finding
an
and
suddenly
a
new
unexpected
memory
from
that
realm
of
pure
and
loving
childhood
presented
itself
to

remembered
natasha
as
he
had
seen
her
for
the
first
time
at
the
ball
in
with
her
slender
neck
and
arms
and
with
a
frightened
happy
face
ready
for
and
love
and
tenderness
for
stronger
and
more
vivid
than
awoke
in
his
he
now
remembered
the
connection
that
existed
between
himself
and
this
man
who
was
dimly
gazing
at
him
through
tears
that
filled
his
swollen
he
remembered
and
ecstatic
pity
and
love
for
that
man
overflowed
his
happy
prince
andrew
could
no
longer
restrain
himself
and
wept
tender
loving
tears
for
his
fellow
for
and
for
his

their

chapter
xxxviii
the
terrible
spectacle
of
the
battlefield
covered
with
dead
and
together
with
the
heaviness
of
his
head
and
the
news
that
some
twenty
generals
he
knew
personally
had
been
killed
or
and
the
consciousness
of
the
impotence
of
his
once
mighty
produced
an
unexpected
impression
on
napoleon
who
usually
liked
to
look
at
the
killed
and
he
testing
his
strength
of
this
day
the
horrible
appearance
of
the
battlefield
overcame
that
strength
of
mind
which
he
thought
constituted
his
merit
and
his
he
rode
hurriedly
from
the
battlefield
and
returned
to
the
shevardino
where
he
sat
on
his
his
sallow
face
swollen
and
his
eyes
his
nose
and
his
voice
involuntarily
with
downcast
to
the
sounds
of
with
painful
dejection
he
awaited
the
end
of
this
in
which
he
regarded
himself
as
a
participant
and
which
he
was
unable
to
a
human
feeling
for
a
brief
moment
got
the
better
of
the
artificial
phantasm
of
life
he
had
served
so
he
felt
in
his
own
person
the
sufferings
and
death
he
had
witnessed
on
the
the
heaviness
of
his
head
and
chest
reminded
him
of
the
possibility
of
suffering
and
death
for
at
that
moment
he
did
not
desire
or
or
glory
need
had
he
for
any
more
the
one
thing
he
wished
for
was
and
but
when
he
had
been
on
the
semenovsk
heights
the
artillery
commander
had
proposed
to
him
to
bring
several
batteries
of
artillery
up
to
those
heights
to
strengthen
the
fire
on
the
russian
troops
crowded
in
front
of
napoleon
had
assented
and
had
given
orders
that
news
should
be
brought
to
him
of
the
effect
those
batteries
an
adjutant
came
now
to
inform
him
that
the
fire
of
two
hundred
guns
had
been
concentrated
on
the
as
he
had
but
that
they
still
held
their
fire
is
mowing
them
down
by
but
still
they
hold
said
the
want
said
napoleon
in
a
hoarse
asked
the
adjutant
who
had
not
heard
the
want
croaked
napoleon
them
have
even
before
he
gave
that
order
the
thing
he
did
not
and
for
which
he
gave
the
order
only
because
he
thought
it
was
expected
of
was
being
and
he
fell
back
into
that
artificial
realm
of
imaginary
and
a
horse
walking
a
treadmill
thinks
it
is
doing
something
for
submissively
fulfilled
the
and
inhuman
role
predestined
for
and
not
for
that
day
and
hour
alone
were
the
mind
and
conscience
darkened
of
this
man
on
whom
the
responsibility
for
what
was
happening
lay
more
than
on
all
the
others
who
took
part
in
never
to
the
end
of
his
life
could
he
understand
or
or
the
significance
of
his
actions
which
were
too
contrary
to
goodness
and
too
remote
from
everything
for
him
ever
to
be
able
to
grasp
their
he
could
not
disavow
his
belauded
as
they
were
by
half
the
and
so
he
had
to
repudiate
and
all
not
only
on
that
as
he
rode
over
the
battlefield
strewn
with
men
killed
and
maimed
his
will
as
he
did
he
reckon
as
he
looked
at
them

many
russians
there
were

reason
for
rejoicing
in
the
calculation
that
there
were
five

write
in
a
letter
to
paris

fifty
thousand
corpses
lay

even
on
the

boldly
took
the

mind
found
justification
in
the
belief
that
among
the
hundreds
of
thousands
who
perished
there
were
fewer
frenchmen
than
hessians
and
chapter
xxxix
several
tens
of
thousands
of
the
slain
lay
in
diverse
postures
and
various
uniforms
on
the
fields
and
meadows
belonging
to
the
davydov
family
and
to
the
crown
fields
and
meadows
where
for
hundreds
of
years
the
peasants
of

had
reaped
their
harvests
and
pastured
their
at
the
dressing
stations
the
grass
and
earth
were
soaked
with
blood
for
a
space
of
some
three
acres
crowds
of
men
of
various
wounded
and
with
frightened
dragged
themselves
back
to
mozhaysk
from
the
one
army
and
back
to
valuevo
from
the
other
exhausted
and
went
forward
led
by
their
others
held
their
ground
and
continued
to
over
the
whole
previously
so
gaily
beautiful
with
the
glitter
of
bayonets
and
cloudlets
of
smoke
in
the
morning
there
now
spread
a
mist
of
damp
and
smoke
and
a
strange
acid
smell
of
saltpeter
and
clouds
gathered
and
drops
of
rain
began
to
fall
on
the
dead
and
on
the
and
hesitating
as
if
to
bethink
what
are
you
to
the
men
of
both
sides
worn
out
by
want
of
food
and
it
began
equally
to
appear
doubtful
whether
they
should
continue
to
slaughter
one
all
the
faces
expressed
and
the
question
arose
in
every
for
must
i
kill
and
be
you
may
go
and
kill
whom
you
but
i
want
to
do
so
by
evening
this
thought
had
ripened
in
every
at
any
moment
these
men
might
have
been
seized
with
horror
at
what
they
were
doing
and
might
have
thrown
up
everything
and
run
away
but
though
toward
the
end
of
the
battle
the
men
felt
all
the
horror
of
what
they
were
though
they
would
have
been
glad
to
leave
some
mysterious
power
continued
to
control
and
they
still
brought
up
the
and
applied
the
though
only
one
artilleryman
survived
out
of
every
and
though
they
stumbled
and
panted
with
perspiring
and
stained
with
blood
and
the
cannon
balls
flew
just
as
swiftly
and
cruelly
from
both
crushing
human
and
that
terrible
work
which
was
not
done
by
the
will
of
a
man
but
at
the
will
of
him
who
governs
men
and
worlds
anyone
looking
at
the
disorganized
rear
of
the
russian
army
would
have
said
if
only
the
french
made
one
more
slight
it
would
and
anyone
looking
at
the
rear
of
the
french
army
would
have
said
that
the
russians
need
only
make
one
more
slight
effort
and
the
french
would
be
but
neither
the
french
nor
the
russians
made
that
and
the
flame
of
battle
burned
slowly
the
russians
did
not
make
that
effort
because
they
were
not
attacking
the
at
the
beginning
of
the
battle
they
stood
blocking
the
way
to
moscow
and
they
still
did
so
at
the
end
of
the
battle
as
at
the
but
even
had
the
aim
of
the
russians
been
to
drive
the
french
from
their
they
could
not
have
made
this
last
for
all
the
russian
troops
had
been
broken
there
was
no
part
of
the
russian
army
that
had
not
suffered
in
the
and
though
still
holding
their
positions
they
had
lost
one
half
of
their
the
with
the
memory
of
all
their
former
victories
during
fifteen
with
the
assurance
of
with
the
consciousness
that
they
had
captured
part
of
the
battlefield
and
had
lost
only
a
quarter
of
their
men
and
still
had
their
guards
twenty
thousand
might
easily
have
made
that
the
french
who
had
attacked
the
russian
army
in
order
to
drive
it
from
its
position
ought
to
have
made
that
for
as
long
as
the
russians
continued
to
block
the
road
to
moscow
as
the
aim
of
the
french
had
not
been
attained
and
all
their
efforts
and
losses
were
in
but
the
french
did
not
make
that
some
historians
say
that
napoleon
need
only
have
used
his
old
who
were
and
the
battle
would
have
been
to
speak
of
what
would
have
happened
had
napoleon
sent
his
guards
is
like
talking
of
what
would
happen
if
autumn
became
it
could
not
napoleon
did
not
give
his
not
because
he
did
not
want
but
because
it
could
not
be
all
the
and
soldiers
of
the
french
army
knew
it
could
not
be
because
the
flagging
spirit
of
the
troops
would
not
permit
it
was
not
napoleon
alone
who
had
experienced
that
nightmare
feeling
of
the
mighty
arm
being
stricken
but
all
the
generals
and
soldiers
of
his
army
whether
they
had
taken
part
in
the
battle
or
after
all
their
experience
of
previous
after
one
tenth
of
such
efforts
the
enemy
had
a
similar
feeling
of
terror
before
an
enemy
after
losing
half
his
stood
as
threateningly
at
the
end
as
at
the
beginning
of
the
the
moral
force
of
the
attacking
french
army
was
not
that
sort

absolute

of

not

to

of

kind
become
comprehensible
to
man
only
when
he
examines
arbitrarily
selected
elements
of
that
but
at
the
same
a
large
proportion
of
human
error
comes
from
the
arbitrary
division
of
continuous
motion
into
discontinuous
there
is
a
well
sophism
of
the
ancients
consisting
in
that
achilles
could
never
catch
up
with
a
tortoise
he
was
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
traveled
ten
times
as
fast
as
the
by
the
time
achilles
has
covered
the
distance
that
separated
him
from
the
the
tortoise
has
covered
one
tenth
of
that
distance
ahead
of
when
achilles
has
covered
that
the
tortoise
has
covered
another
one
and
so
on
this
problem
seemed
to
the
ancients
the
absurd
answer
achilles
could
never
overtake
the
resulted
from
that
motion
was
arbitrarily
divided
into
discontinuous
whereas
the
motion
both
of
achilles
and
of
the
tortoise
was
by
adopting
smaller
and
smaller
elements
of
motion
we
only
approach
a
solution
of
the
but
never
reach
only
when
we
have
admitted
the
conception
of
the
infinitely
and
the
resulting
geometrical
progression
with
a
common
ratio
of
one
and
have
found
the
sum
of
this
progression
to
do
we
reach
a
solution
of
the
a
modern
branch
of
mathematics
having
achieved
the
art
of
dealing
with
the
infinitely
small
can
now
yield
solutions
in
other
more
complex
problems
of
motion
which
used
to
appear
this
modern
branch
of
unknown
to
the
when
dealing
with
problems
of
motion
admits
the
conception
of
the
infinitely
and
so
conforms
to
the
chief
condition
of
motion
and
thereby
corrects
the
inevitable
error
which
the
human
mind
cannot
avoid
when
it
deals
with
separate
elements
of
motion
instead
of
examining
continuous
in
seeking
the
laws
of
historical
movement
just
the
same
thing
the
movement
of
arising
as
it
does
from
innumerable
arbitrary
human
is
to
understand
the
laws
of
this
continuous
movement
is
the
aim
of
but
to
arrive
at
these
resulting
from
the
sum
of
all
those
human
mind
postulates
arbitrary
and
disconnected
the
first
method
of
history
is
to
take
an
arbitrarily
selected
series
of
continuous
events
and
examine
it
apart
from
though
there
is
and
can
be
no
beginning
to
any
for
one
event
always
flows
uninterruptedly
from
the
second
method
is
to
consider
the
actions
of
some
one
king
or
a
equivalent
to
the
sum
of
many
individual
whereas
the
sum
of
individual
wills
is
never
expressed
by
the
activity
of
a
single
historic
historical
science
in
its
endeavor
to
draw
nearer
to
truth
continually
takes
smaller
and
smaller
units
for
but
however
small
the
units
it
we
feel
that
to
take
any
unit
disconnected
from
or
to
assume
a
beginning
of
any
or
to
say
that
the
will
of
many
men
is
expressed
by
the
actions
of
any
one
historic
is
in
itself
it
needs
no
critical
exertion
to
reduce
utterly
to
dust
any
deductions
drawn
from
it
is
merely
necessary
to
select
some
larger
or
smaller
unit
as
the
subject
of
criticism
has
every
right
to
seeing
that
whatever
unit
history
observes
must
always
be
arbitrarily
only
by
taking
infinitesimally
small
units
for
observation
differential
of
that
the
individual
tendencies
of
and
attaining
to
the
art
of
integrating
them
finding
the
sum
of
these
can
we
hope
to
arrive
at
the
laws
of
the
first
fifteen
years
of
the
nineteenth
century
in
europe
present
an
extraordinary
movement
of
millions
of
men
leave
their
customary
hasten
from
one
side
of
europe
to
the
plunder
and
slaughter
one
triumph
and
are
plunged
in
and
for
some
years
the
whole
course
of
life
is
altered
and
presents
an
intensive
movement
which
first
increases
and
then
what
was
the
cause
of
this
by
what
laws
was
it
asks
the
mind
of
the
replying
to
this
lay
before
us
the
sayings
and
doings
of
a
few
dozen
men
in
a
building
in
the
city
of
calling
these
sayings
and
doings
then
they
give
a
detailed
biography
of
napoleon
and
of
certain
people
favorable
or
hostile
to
tell
of
the
influence
some
of
these
people
had
on
and
that
is
why
this
movement
took
place
and
those
are
its
but
the
mind
of
man
not
only
refuses
to
believe
this
but
plainly
says
that
this
method
of
explanation
is
because
in
it
a
weaker
phenomenon
is
taken
as
the
cause
of
a
the
sum
of
human
wills
produced
the
revolution
and
and
only
the
sum
of
those
wills
first
tolerated
and
then
destroyed
every
time
there
have
been
conquests
there
have
been
every
time
there
has
been
a
revolution
in
any
state
there
have
been
great
says
human
reason
every
time
conquerors
appear
there
have
been
but
this
does
not
prove
that
the
conquerors
caused
the
wars
and
that
it
is
possible
to
find
the
laws
of
a
war
in
the
personal
activity
of
a
single
whenever
i
look
at
my
watch
and
its
hands
point
to
i
hear
the
bells
of
the
neighboring
but
because
the
bells
begin
to
ring
when
the
hands
of
the
clock
reach
i
have
no
right
to
assume
that
the
movement
of
the
bells
is
caused
by
the
position
of
the
hands
of
the
whenever
i
see
the
movement
of
a
locomotive
i
hear
the
whistle
and
see
the
valves
opening
and
wheels
but
i
have
no
right
to
conclude
that
the
whistling
and
the
turning
of
wheels
are
the
cause
of
the
movement
of
the
the
peasants
say
that
a
cold
wind
blows
in
late
spring
because
the
oaks
are
and
really
every
spring
cold
winds
do
blow
when
the
oak
is
but
though
i
do
not
know
what
causes
the
cold
winds
to
blow
when
the
oak
buds
i
cannot
agree
with
the
peasants
that
the
unfolding
of
the
oak
buds
is
the
cause
of
the
cold
for
the
force
of
the
wind
is
beyond
the
influence
of
the
i
see
only
a
coincidence
of
occurrences
such
as
happens
with
all
the
phenomena
of
and
i
see
that
however
much
and
however
carefully
i
observe
the
hands
of
the
and
the
valves
and
wheels
of
the
and
the
i
shall
not
discover
the
cause
of
the
bells
the
engine
or
of
the
winds
of
to
that
i
must
entirely
change
my
point
of
view
and
study
the
laws
of
the
movement
of
of
the
and
of
the
history
must
do
the
and
attempts
in
this
direction
have
already
been
to
study
the
laws
of
history
we
must
completely
change
the
subject
of
our
must
leave
aside
and
and
study
the
infinitesimally
small
elements
by
which
the
masses
are
no
one
can
say
in
how
far
it
is
possible
for

to
advance
in
this
way
toward
an
understanding
of
the
laws

it
is
evident
that
only
along
that
path
does
the
possibility
of
discovering
the
laws

and
that
as

not
a

by
any
one
of

sitting
over

in

may
imagine
how
he
would
have
arranged

in

why
did

during

not

never

at

import
of

of

most
complex
play
of
and
deceptions
and
is
continually
obliged
to
reply
to
innumerable
questions
addressed
to
which
constantly
conflict
with
one
learned
military
authorities
quite
seriously
tell
us
that
kutuzov
should
have
moved
his
army
to
the
kaluga
road
long
before
reaching
and
that
somebody
actually
submitted
such
a
proposal
to
but
a
commander
in
especially
at
a
difficult
has
always
before
him
not
one
proposal
but
dozens
and
all
these
based
on
strategics
and
contradict
each
a
it
would

simply
to
choose
one
of
these
but
even
that
he
cannot
events
and
time
do
not
for
on
the
it
is
suggested
to
him
to
cross
to
the
kaluga
but
just
then
an
adjutant
gallops
up
from
miloradovich
asking
whether
he
is
to
engage
the
french
or
an
order
must
be
given
him
at
that
and
the
order
to
retreat
carries
us
past
the
turn
to
the
kaluga
and
after
the
adjutant
comes
the
commissary
general
asking
where
the
stores
are
to
be
and
the
chief
of
the
hospitals
asks
where
the
wounded
are
to
and
a
courier
from
petersburg
brings
a
letter
from
the
sovereign
which
does
not
admit
of
the
possibility
of
abandoning

the
the
man
who
is
undermining
him
there
are
always
not
merely
one
but
several
presents
a
new
project
diametrically
opposed
to
that
of
turning
to
the
kaluga

the
chief
himself

and
refreshment

dealt
with

anyone
gave

asked
for

done
in

made

or
express
any

or

he
generally
turned
away
with
an
air
of
as
though
they
were
not
speaking
of
anything
he
wished
to
some
discussed
the
position
that
had
been
criticizing
not
the
position
itself
so
much
as
the
mental
capacity
of
those
who
had
chosen
others
argued
that
a
mistake
had
been
made
earlier
and
that
a
battle
should
have
been
fought
two
days
others
again
spoke
of
the
battle
of
which
was
described
by
a
newly
arrived
frenchman
in
a
spanish
frenchman
and
one
of
the
german
princes
serving
with
the
russian
army
were
discussing
the
siege
of
saragossa
and
considering
the
possibility
of
defending
moscow
in
a
similar
count
rostopchin
was
telling
a
fourth
group
that
he
was
prepared
to
die
with
the
city
train
bands
under
the
walls
of
the
but
that
he
still
could
not
help
regretting
having
been
left
in
ignorance
of
what
was
and
that
had
he
known
it
sooner
things
would
have
been
a
fifth

the
profundity
of
their
strategic
discussed
the
direction
the
troops
would
now
have
to
a
sixth
group
was
talking
absolute
expression
grew
more
and
more
preoccupied
and
from
all
this
talk
he
saw
only
one
that
to
defend
moscow
was
a
physical
impossibility
in
the
full
meaning
of
those
that
is
to
so
utterly
impossible
that
if
any
senseless
commander
were
to
give
orders
to
confusion
would
result
but
the
battle
would
still
not
take
it
would
not
take
place
because
the
commanders
not
merely
all
recognized
the
position
to
be
but
in
their
conversations
were
only
discussing
what
would
happen
after
its
inevitable
how
could
the
commanders
lead
their
troops
to
a
field
of
battle
they
considered
impossible
to
the
officers
and
even
the
soldiers
too
also
considered
the
position
impossible
and
therefore
could
not
go
to
fully
convinced
as
they
were
of
if
bennigsen
insisted
on
the
position
being
defended
and
others
still
discussed
the
question
was
no
longer
important
in
itself
but
only
as
a
pretext
for
disputes
and
this
kutuzov
knew
who
had
chosen
the
warmly
displayed
his
russian
patriotism
could
not
listen
to
this
without
by
insisting
that
moscow
must
be
his
aim
was
as
clear
as
daylight
to
if
the
defense
to
throw
the
blame
on
kutuzov
who
had
brought
the
army
as
far
as
the
sparrow
hills
without
giving
if
it
to
claim
the
success
as
his
or
if
battle
were
not
to
clear
himself
of
the
crime
of
abandoning
but
this
intrigue
did
not
now
occupy
the
old
one
terrible
question
absorbed
him
and
to
that
question
he
heard
no
reply
from
the
question
for
him
now
i
really
allowed
napoleon
to
reach
and
when
did
i
do
when
was
it
can
it
have
been
yesterday
when
i
ordered
platov
to
or
was
it
the
evening
when
i
had
a
nap
and
told
bennigsen
to
issue
or
was
it
earlier
when
was
this
terrible
affair
moscow
must
be
the
army
must
retreat
and
the
order
to
do
so
must
be
to
give
that
terrible
order
seemed
to
him
equivalent
to
resigning
the
command
of
the
and
not
only
did
he
love
power
to
which
he
was
accustomed
honours
awarded
to
prince
under
whom
he
had
served
in
galled
but
he
was
convinced
that
he
was
destined
to
save
russia
and
that
that
was
against
the
wish
and
by
the
will
of
the
he
had
been
chosen
he
was
convinced
that
he
alone
could
maintain
command
of
the
army
in
these
difficult
and
that
in
all
the
world
he
alone
could
encounter
the
invincible
napoleon
without
and
he
was
horrified
at
the
thought
of
the
order
he
had
to
but
something
had
to
be
and
these
conversations
around
him
which
were
assuming
too
free
a
character
must
be
he
called
the
most
important
generals
to
be
it
good
or
must
depend
on
said

about
to
draw
back
the
curtain
of

the

moved

angrily
and
kaysarov
understood
that
his
serene
highness
did
not
wish
his
face
to
be
round
the
deal
on
which
lay
and
so
many
people
gathered
that
the

brought
in
another
bench
and
put
it
beside

shivering

in

sat

with
rapid
gesticulations
was
giving
him
some
speaking
in

tones

absorbed
in

now
at

and
now
at
the

with
a
look

kindly
face
was
lit
up
by
a
sly
his

met
and
the
expression
of
his
eyes
caused
the
little
girl
to

were
all
waiting
for
who
on
the
pretext
of
inspecting
the
position
was
finishing
his
savory
they
waited
for
him
from
four
till
six
and
did
not
begin
their
deliberations
all
that
time
but
talked
in
low
tones
of
other
only
when
bennigsen
had
entered
the
hut
did
kutuzov
leave
his
corner
and
draw
toward
the
but
not
near
enough
for
the
candles
that
had
been
placed
there
to
light
up
his
bennigsen
opened
the
council
with
the
we
to
abandon
ancient
and
sacred
capital
without
a

are
we
to
defend
a
prolonged
and
general
silence
there
was
a
frown
on
every
face
and
only
angry
grunts
and
occasional
cough
broke
the
all
eyes
were
gazing
at
malasha
too
looked
at
she
was
nearest
to
him
and
saw
how
his
face
he
seemed
about
to
but
this
did
not
last
ancient
and
sacred
he
suddenly
repeating
words
in
an
angry
voice
and
thereby
drawing
attention
to
the
false
note
in
me
to
tell
your
that
that
question
has
no
meaning
for
a

a
question
cannot
be
it
is
the
question
i
have
asked
these
gentlemen
to
meet
to
discuss
is
a
military
the
question
is
that
of
saving
is
it
better
to
give
up
moscow
without
a
or
by
accepting
battle
to
risk
losing
the
army
as
well
as
that
is
the
question
on
which
i
want
your
and
he
sank
back
in
his
the
discussion
bennigsen
did
not
yet
consider
his
game
admitting
the
view
of
barclay
and
others
that
a
defensive
battle
at
fili
was
but
imbued
with
russian
patriotism
and
the
love
of
he
proposed
to
move
troops
from
the
right
to
the
left
flank
during
the
night
and
attack
the
french
right
flank
the
following
opinions
were
and
arguments
were
advanced
for
and
against
that
and
raevski
agreed
with
whether
feeling
it
necessary
to
make
a
sacrifice
before
abandoning
the
capital
or
guided
by
personal
these
generals
seemed
not
to
understand
that
this
council
could
not
alter
the
inevitable
course
of
events
and
that
moscow
was
in
effect
already
the
other
understood
it
leaving
aside
the
question
of

of
the
direction
the
army
should
take
in
its
who
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
what
was
going
on
before
understood
the
meaning
of
the
council
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
was
only
a
personal
struggle
between
and
as
she
termed
she
saw
that
they
grew
spiteful
when
they
spoke
to
one
and
in
her
heart
she
sided
with
in
the
midst
of
the
conversation
she
noticed
give
bennigsen
a
subtle
and
then
to
her
joys
she
saw
that
said
something
to
which
settled
bennigsen
suddenly
reddened
and
paced
angrily
up
and
down
the
what
so
affected
him
was
calm
and
quiet
comment
on
the
advantage
or
disadvantage
of
proposal
to
move
troops
by
night
from
the
right
to
the
left

to
attack

not

because
our
troops
were
rearranged

near

followed
a
momentary
which
seemed
very
long
to
them
the
discussion
but
pauses
frequently
occurred
and
they
all
felt
that
there
was
no
more
to

one
of
these
pauses

heaved
a
deep

as
the
retreat
of

beyond

faced

strength
to
find
what

should

that
most
difficult

as
soon
as

would
always

every

a
consciousness

and
a
foreboding
that

present
in
russian
moscow
society

those
who
had
quitted

already
in

at

showed
that

who
went
taking

half
their

so
from
the
latent
patriotism
which
expresses
itself
not
by
phrases

by
giving
children

save
the

similar
unnatural
but
and
therefore
in
the
way
that
always

most

disgraceful

ashamed

ashamed
to

still
they
knowing
it
had

why

it
is
impossible
to
suppose
that
rostopchin
had
scared
them
by
his
accounts
of
horrors
napoleon
had
committed
in

the
first
people
to
go
away
were
the
rich
educated
people
who
knew
quite
well
that
vienna
and
berlin
had
remained
intact
and
that
during
occupation
the
inhabitants
had
spent
their
time
pleasantly
in
the
company
of
the
charming
frenchmen
whom
the
and
especially
the
russian
then
liked
so
they
went
away
because
for
russians
there
could
be
no
question
as
to
whether
things
would
go
well
or
ill
under
french
rule
in
it
was
out
of
the
question
to
be
under
french
it
would
be
the
worst
thing
that
could
they
went
away
even
before
the
battle
of
borodino
and
still
more
rapidly
after
despite
calls
to
defend
moscow
or
the
announcement
of
his
intention
to
take
the
icon
of
the
iberian
mother
of
god

were

despite
all
the
nonsense
rostopchin
wrote
in

knew
that

that
if
it
could
not
succeed
it
would
not
do
to
take
young
ladies
and
house
serfs
to
the
three
hills
quarter
of
moscow
to

and
that
they
must
go
sorry
as
they
were
to
abandon
their
property
to
they
went
away

of
the
tremendous
significance
of

immense
and

herself
in

in

enjoyed
the

protection
of
a
grandee

occupied

of

posts
in

had
formed

she
returned
to

the
magnate

the
prince

and
both
claimed
their
helene

faced
by
a
new
to
preserve
her
intimacy
with
both
without
offending
what
would
have
seemed
difficult

even
impossible
to
another
woman

not
cause
the

embarrassment
to
countess
who
evidently
deserved
her
reputation
of
being
a
very
clever
had
she
attempted
or
tried
to
extricate
herself
from
her
awkward
position
by
she
would
have
spoiled
her
case
by
acknowledging
herself
but
like
a
really
great
man
who
can
do
whatever
he
at
once
assumed
her
own
position
to
be
as
she
sincerely
believed
it
to
and
that
everyone
else
was
to
the
first
time
the
young
foreigner
allowed
himself
to
reproach
she
lifted
her
beautiful
head
half
turning
to
said
just
like
a
and
i
expected
nothing
a
woman
sacrifices
herself
for
she
and
this
is
her
what
right
have
to
demand
an
account
of
my
attachments
and
he
is
a
man
who
has
been
more
than
a
father
to
the
prince
was
about
to
say
but
helene
interrupted
said
may
be
that
he
has
other
sentiments
for
me
than
those
of
a
but
that
is
not
a
reason
for
me
to
shut
my
door
on
i
am
not
a
that
i
should
repay
kindness
with
that
in
all
that
relates
to
my
intimate
feelings
i
render
account
only
to
god
and
to
my

laying
her
hand
on
her
fully
expanded
bosom
and
looking
up
to
for
sake
listen
to
and
i
will
be
your
deign
to
demean
yourself
by
marrying
said
beginning
to
the
prince
tried
to
comfort
but
as
if
quite
said
through
her
tears
that
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
her
that
there
were
precedents
were
up
to
that
time
very
but
she
mentioned
napoleon
and
some
other
exalted
that
she
had
never
been
her
and
that
she
had
been
the
said
the
already
what
have
they
been
invented
for
if
they
arrange
said
the
prince
was
surprised
that
so
simple
an
idea
had
not
occurred
to
and
he
applied
for
advice
to
the
holy
brethren
of
the
society
of
with
whom
he
was
on
intimate
a
few
days
later
at
one
of
those
enchanting
fetes
which
helene
gave
at
her
country
house
on
the
stone
the
charming
monsieur
de
a
man
no
longer
with
snow
white
hair
and
brilliant
black
a
jesuit
a
robe
courte
was
presented
to
and
in
the
garden
by
the
light
of
the
illuminations
and
to
the
sound
of
music
talked
to
her
for
a
long
time
of
the
love
of
of
of
the
sacred
and
of
the
consolations
the
one
true
catholic
religion
affords
in
this
world
and
the
helene
was
and
more
than
once
tears
rose
to
her
eyes
and
to
those
of
monsieur
de
jobert
and
their
voices
a
for
which
her
partner
came
to
seek
put
an
end
to
her
discourse
with
her
future
directeur
de
but
the
next
evening
monsieur
de
jobert
came
to
see
helene
when
she
was
and
after
that
often
came
lay
member
of
the
society
of
one
day
he
took
the
countess
to
a
roman
catholic
where
she
knelt
down
before
the
altar
to
which
she
was
the
frenchman
laid
his
hands
on
her
head
as
she
herself
afterward
described
she
felt
something
like
a
fresh
breeze
wafted
into
her
it
was
explained
to
her
that
this
was
la
after
that
a
abbe
was
brought
to
she
confessed
to
and
he
absolved
her
from
her
next
day
she
received
a
box
containing
the
sacred
which
was
left
at
her
house
for
her
to
partake
a
few
days
later
helene
learned
with
pleasure
that
she
had
now
been
admitted
to
the
true
catholic
church
and
that
in
a
few
days
the
pope
himself
would
hear
of
her
and
would
send
her
a
certain
all
that
was
done
around
her
and
to
her
at
this
all
the
attention
devoted
to
her
by
so
many
clever
men
and
expressed
in
such
refined
and
the
state
of
purity
she
was
now
in
wore
only
white
dresses
and
white
ribbons
all
that
gave
her
but
her
pleasure
did
not
cause
her
for
a
moment
to
forget
her
and
as
it
always
happens
in
contests
of
cunning
that
a
stupid
person
gets
the
better
of
cleverer
realized
that
the
main
object
of
all
these
words
and
all
this
trouble
after
converting
her
to
to
obtain
money
from
her
for
jesuit
institutions
to
which
she
received
parting
with
her
money
insisted
that
the
various
operations
necessary
to
free
her
from
her
husband
should
be
in
her
view
the
aim
of
every
religion
was
merely
to
preserve
certain
proprieties
while
affording
satisfaction
to
human
and
with
this
in
one
of
her
talks
with
her
father
she
insisted
on
an
answer
to
the
in
how
far
was
she
bound
by
her
they
were
sitting
in
the
twilight
by
a
window
in
the
drawing

scent
of
flowers

in
at

wearing
a
white
transparent
over
her
shoulders
and
the
a
man
with
a
a
pleasant
firm
and
white
hands
meekly
folded
on
his
sat
close
to
helene
with
a
subtle
smile
on
his
lips
and
a
peaceful
look
of
delight
at
her
occasionally
glanced
at
her
face
as
he
explained
his
opinion
on
the
helene
with
an
uneasy
smile
looked
at
his
curly
hair
and
his
blackish
cheeks
and
every
moment
expected
the
conversation
to
take
a
fresh
but
the
though
he
evidently
enjoyed
the
beauty
of
his
was
absorbed
in
his
mastery
of
the
the
course
of
the
father
arguments
ran
as
of
the
import
of
what
you
were
you
made
a
vow
of
conjugal
fidelity
to
a
man
who
on
his
by
entering
the
married
state
without
faith
in
the
religious
significance
of
committed
an
act
of
that
marriage
lacked
the
dual
significance
it
should
have
yet
in
spite
of
this
your
vow
was
you
swerved
from
what
did
you
commit
by
so
a
or
a
a
venial
for
you
acted
without
evil
if
now
you
married
again
with
the
object
of
bearing
your
sin
might
be
but
the
question
is
again
a
twofold
but
suddenly
who
was
getting
said
with
one
of
her
bewitching
i
think
that
having
espoused
the
true
religion
i
cannot
be
bound
by
what
a
false
religion
laid
upon
the
director
of
her
conscience
was
astounded
at
having
the
case
presented
to
him
thus
with
the
simplicity
of
he
was
delighted
at
the
unexpected
rapidity
of
his
but
could
not
abandon
the
edifice
of
argument
he
had
laboriously
us
understand
one
said
he
with
a
and
began
refuting
his
spiritual
chapter
vii
helene
understood
that
the
question
was
very
simple
and
easy
from
the
ecclesiastical
point
of
and
that
her
directors
were
making
difficulties
only
because
they
were
apprehensive
as
to
how
the
matter
would
be
regarded
by
the
secular
so
she
decided
that
it
was
necessary
to
prepare
the
opinion
of
she
provoked
the
jealousy
of
the
elderly
magnate
and
told
him
what
she
had
told
her
other
that
she
put
the
matter
so
that
the
only
way
for
him
to
obtain
a
right
over
her
was
to
marry
the
elderly
magnate
was
at
first
as
much
taken
aback
by
this
suggestion
of
marriage
with
a
woman
whose
husband
was
as
the
younger
man
had
but
imperturbable
conviction
that
it
was
as
simple
and
natural
as
marrying
a
maiden
had
its
effect
on
him
had
helene
herself
shown
the
least
sign
of
or
her
cause
would
certainly
have
been
but
not
only
did
she
show
no
signs
of
secrecy
or
on
the
with
naivete
she
told
her
intimate
friends
these
were
all
that
both
the
prince
and
the
magnate
had
proposed
to
her
and
that
she
loved
both
and
was
afraid
of
grieving
a
rumor
immediately
spread
in
not
that
helene
wanted
to
be
divorced
from
her
husband
such
a
report
spread
many
would
have
opposed
so
illegal
an
but
simply
that
the
unfortunate
and
interesting
helene
was
in
doubt
which
of
the
two
men
she
should
the
question
was
no
longer
whether
this
was
but
only
which
was
the
better
match
and
how
the
matter
would
be
regarded
at
there
it
is
some
rigid
individuals
unable
to
rise
to
the
height
of
such
a
who
saw
in
the
project
a
desecration
of
the
sacrament
of
but
there
were
not
many
such
and
they
remained
while
the
majority
were
interested
in
good
fortune
and
in
the
question
which
match
would
be
the
more
whether
it
was
right
or
wrong
to
remarry
while
one
had
a
husband
living
they
did
not
for
that
question
had
evidently
been
settled
by
people
than
you
or
as
they
and
to
doubt
the
correctness
of
that
decision
would
be
to
risk
exposing
stupidity
and
incapacity
to
live
in
only
marya
dmitrievna
who
had
come
to
petersburg
that
summer
to

herself
plainly
to
express
an
opinion
contrary

her
in

middle
of
the
room

up

across

was

as
a

so

what
she
had
said

only
and
repeated
in
a
the
one
coarse
word
she
had
supposing
the
whole
sting
of
her
remark
to
lie
in
that
prince
who
of
late
very
often
forgot
what
he
had
said
and
repeated
one
and
the

thing
a
hundred
remarked
to
his

my

consult
only
your

is
all
i
have
to
and
concealing
his
unvarying
emotion
he
would
press
his
cheek
against
his
and
move

had
not
lost
his
reputation
of
an
exceedingly
clever
and
who
was

divorce
said
helene
among
those
who
ventured
to
doubt
the
justifiability
of
the
proposed
marriage
was
princess
she
was
continually
tormented
by
jealousy
of
her
and
now
that
jealousy
concerned
a
subject
near
to
her
own
she
could
not
reconcile
herself
to
the
she
consulted
a
russian
priest
as
to
the
possibility
of
divorce
and
remarriage
during
a
and
the
priest
told
her
that
it
was
and
to
her
delight
showed
her
a
text
in
the
gospel
which
it
seemed
to
plainly
forbids
remarriage
while
the
husband
is
armed
with
these
which
appeared
to
her
she
drove
to
her
early
one
morning
so
as
to
find
her
having
listened
to
her
helene
smiled
blandly
and
it
says
shall
marry
her
that
is
said
the
old
ne
dites
pas
de
vous
ne
comprenez
dans
ma
position
des
said
helene
changing
from
in
which
language
she
always
felt
that
her
case
did
not
sound
quite
into
french
which
suited
it
talk
you
understand
in
my
position
i
have
my
how
is
it
you
understand
that
the
holy
who
has
the
right
to
grant
just
then
the
lady
companion
who
lived
with
helene
came
in
to
announce
that
his
highness
was
in
the
ballroom
and
wished
to
see
que
je
ne
veux
pas
le
que
je
suis
furieuse
contre
parce
manque
tell
him
i
wish
to
see
i
am
furious
with
him
for
not
keeping
his
word
to
a
tout
peche
said
a
young
man
with
a
long
face
and
as
he
entered
the
there
is
mercy
for
every
the
old
princess
rose
respectfully
and
the
young
man
who
had
entered
took
no
notice
of
the
princess
nodded
to
her
daughter
and
sidled
out
of
the
she
is
thought
the
old
all
her
convictions
dissipated
by
the
appearance
of
his
is
but
how
is
it
that
we
in
our
irrecoverable
youth
did
not
know
yet
it
is
so
she
thought
as
she
got
into
her
by
the
beginning
of
august
affairs
were
clearly
defined
and
she
wrote
a
letter
to
her
as
she
loved
her
very
him
of
her
intention
to
marry
and
of
her
having
embraced
the
one
true
and
asking
him
to
carry
out
all
the
formalities
necessary
for
a
which
would
be
explained
to
him
by
the
bearer
of
the
and
so
i
pray
god
to
have
my
in
his
holy
and
powerful
friend
this
letter
was
brought
to
house
when
he
was
on
the
field
of
chapter
viii
toward
the
end
of
the
battle
of
having
run
down
from
battery
a
second
made
his
way
through
a
gully
to
knyazkovo
with
a
crowd
of
reached
the
dressing
and
seeing
blood
and
hearing
cries
and
groans
hurried
still
entangled
in
the
crowds
of
the
one
thing
he
now
desired
with
his
whole
soul
was
to
get
away
quickly
from
the
terrible
sensations
amid
which
he
had
lived
that
day
and
return
to
ordinary
conditions
of
life
and
sleep
quietly
in
a
room
in
his
own
he
felt
that
only
in
the
ordinary
conditions
of
life
would
he
be
able
to
understand
himself
and
all
he
had
seen
and
but
such
ordinary
conditions
of
life
were
nowhere
to
be
though
shells
and
bullets
did
not
whistle
over
the
road
along
which
he
was
still
on
all
sides
there
was
what
there
had
been
on
the
field
of
there
were
still
the
same
and
sometimes
strangely
indifferent
the
same
the
same
the
same
sounds
of
firing
though
distant
still
aroused
and
besides
this
there
were
the
foul
air
and
the
having
gone
a
couple
of
miles
along
the
mozhaysk
pierre
sat
down
by
the
dusk
had
and
the
roar
of
guns
died
pierre
lay
leaning
on
his
elbow
for
a
long
gazing
at
the
shadows
that
moved
past
him
in
the
he
was
continually
imagining
that
a
cannon
ball
was
flying
toward
him
with
a
terrific
and
then
he
shuddered
and
sat
he
had
no
idea
how
long
he
had
been
in
the
middle
of
the
night
three
having
brought
some
settled
down
near
him
and
began
lighting
a
the
who
threw
sidelong
glances
at
got
the
fire
to
burn
and
placed
an
iron
pot
on
it
into
which
they
broke
some
dried
bread
and
put
a
little
the
pleasant
odor
of
greasy
viands
mingled
with
the
smell
of
pierre
sat
up
and
the
three
soldiers
were
eating
and
talking
among
taking
no
notice
of
who
may
you
one
of
them
suddenly
asked
evidently
meaning
what
pierre
himself
had
in
you
want
to
eat
give
you
some
only
let
us
know
whether
you
are
an
honest
said
feeling
it
necessary
to
minimize
his
social
position
as
much
as
possible
so
as
to
be
nearer
to
the
soldiers
and
better
understood
by
rights
i
am
a
militia
but
my
men
are
not
i
came
to
the
battle
and
have
lost
said
one
of
the
another
shook
his
you
like
a
little
the
first
soldier
and
handed
pierre
a
wooden
spoon
after
licking
it
pierre
sat
down
by
the
fire
and
began
eating
the
as
they
called
the
food
in
the
and
he
thought
it
more
delicious
than
any
food
he
had
ever
as
he
sat
bending
greedily
over
helping
himself
to
large
spoonfuls
and
chewing
one
after
his
face
was
lit
up
by
the
fire
and
the
soldiers
looked
at
him
in
have
you
to
go
tell
said
one
of
a
your
peter
come
along
with
take
you
in
the
total
darkness
the
soldiers
walked
with
pierre
to
by
the
time
they
got
near
mozhaysk
and
began
ascending
the
steep
hill
into
the
the
cocks
were
already
pierre
went
on
with
the
quite
forgetting
that
his
inn
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
and
that
he
had
already
passed
he
would
not
soon
have
remembered
such
was
his
state
of
had
he
not
halfway
up
the
hill
stumbled
upon
his
who
had
been
to
look
for
him
in
the
town
and
was
returning
to
the
the
groom
recognized
pierre
in
the
darkness
by
his
white
he
we
were
beginning
to
how
is
it
you
are
on
and
where
are
you
said
the
soldiers
found
your
said
one
of
peter
peter
pierre
heard
the
other
voices
he
said
and
turned
with
his
groom
toward
the
ought
to
give
them
he
and
felt
in
his
better
said
inner
there
was
not
a
room
to
be
had
at
the
they
were
all
pierre
went
out
into
the
yard
covering
himself
up
head
and
lay
down
in
his
chapter
ix
scarcely
had
pierre
laid
his
head
on
the
pillow
before
he
felt
himself
falling
but
almost
with
the
distinctness
of
he
heard
the
boom
of
the
thud
of
groans
and
and
smelled
blood
and
and
a
feeling
of
horror
and
dread
of
death
seized
filled
with
fright
he
opened
his
eyes
and
lifted
his
head
from
under
his
all
was
tranquil
in
the
only
orderly
passed
through
the
splashing
through
the
and
talked
to
the
above
head
some
disturbed
by
the
movement
he
had
made
in
sitting
fluttered
under
the
dark
roof
of
the
the
whole
courtyard
was
permeated
by
a
strong
peaceful
smell
of
stable
delightful
to
pierre
at
that
he
could
see
the
clear
starry
sky
between
the
dark
roofs
of
two
there
is
no
more
of
he
covering
up
his
head
what
a
terrible
thing
is
and
how
shamefully
i
yielded
to
but
they
were
steady
and
calm
all
the
to
the
thought
in
were
the
those
who
had
been
at
the
those
who
had
given
him
and
those
who
had
prayed
before
the
those
strange
men
he
had
not
previously
stood
out
clearly
and
sharply
from
everyone
be
a
just
a
thought
pierre
as
he
fell
enter
communal
life
to
be
imbued
by
what
makes
them
what
they
but
how
cast
off
all
the
devilish
burden
of
my
outer
there
was
a
time
when
i
could
have
done
i
could
have
run
away
from
my
as
i
wanted
or
i
might
have
been
sent
to
serve
as
a
soldier
after
the
duel
with
and
the
memory
of
the
dinner
at
the
english
club
when
he
had
challenged
dolokhov
flashed
through
and
then
he
remembered
his
benefactor
at
and
now
a
picture
of
a
solemn
meeting
of
the
lodge
presented
itself
to
his
it
was
taking
place
at
the
english
club
and
someone
near
and
dear
to
him
sat
at
the
end
of
the
that
is
it
is
my
but
he
thought
he
and
i
did
not
know
he
was
how
sorry
i
am
that
he
and
how
glad
i
am
that
he
is
alive
on
one
side
of
the
table
sat
and
others
like
them
his
dream
the
category
to
which
these
men
belonged
was
as
clearly
defined
in
his
mind
as
the
category
of
those
he
termed
and
he
heard
those
anatole
and
shouting
and
singing
yet
through
their
shouting
the
voice
of
his
benefactor
was
heard
speaking
all
the
time
and
the
sound
of
his
words
was
as
weighty
and
uninterrupted
as
the
booming
on
the
but
pleasant
and
pierre
did
not
understand
what
his
benefactor
was
but
he
knew
categories
of
thoughts
were
also
quite
distinct
in
his
that
he
was
talking
of
goodness
and
the
possibility
of
being
what
they
and
they
with
their
firm
faces
surrounded
his
benefactor
on
all
but
though
they
were
kindly
they
did
not
look
at
pierre
and
did
not
know
wishing
to
speak
and
to
attract
their
he
got
but
at
that
moment
his
legs
grew
cold
and
he
felt
and
with
one
arm
covered
his
legs
from
which
his
cloak
had
in
fact
for
a
moment
as
he
was
rearranging
his
cloak
pierre
opened
his
eyes
and
saw
the
same
penthouse
and
but
now
they
were
all
lit
and
glittering
with
frost
or
is
thought
not
what
i
i
want
to
hear
and
understand
my
again
he
covered
himself
up
with
his
but
now
neither
the
lodge
nor
his
benefactor
was
there
were
only
thoughts
clearly
expressed
in
thoughts
that
someone
was
uttering
or
that
he
himself
was
afterwards
when
he
recalled
those
thoughts
pierre
was
convinced
that
someone
outside
himself
had
spoken
though
the
impressions
of
that
day
had
evoked
he
had
it
seemed
to
been
able
to
think
and
express
his
thoughts
like
that
when
endure
war
is
the
most
difficult
subordination
of
freedom
to
the
law
of
the
voice
had
is
submission
to
the
will
of
you
cannot
escape
from
and
they
are
they
do
not
but
the
spoken
word
is
silver
but
the
unspoken
is
man
can
be
master
of
nothing
while
he
fears
but
he
who
does
not
fear
it
possesses
if
there
were
no
man
would
not
know
his
would
not
know
the
hardest
thing
went
on
or
in
his
is
to
be
able
in
your
soul
to
unite
the
meaning
of
to
unite
he
asked
not
to
thoughts
cannot
be
but
to
harness
all
these
thoughts
together
is
what
we
one
must
harness
must
harness
he
repeated
to
himself
with
inward
feeling
that
these
words
and
they
alone
expressed
what
he
wanted
to
say
and
solved
the
question
that
tormented
one
must
it
is
time
to
to
time
to
your
your
some
voice
was
must
it
is
time
to
it
was
the
voice
of
the
trying
to
wake
the
sun
shone
straight
into
he
glanced
at
the
dirty
innyard
in
the
middle
of
which
soldiers
were
watering
their
lean
horses
at
the
pump
while
carts
were
passing
out
of
the
pierre
turned
away
with
and
closing
his
eyes
quickly
fell
back
on
the
carriage
i
want
i
want
to
see
and
understand
i
want
to
understand
what
was
revealing
itself
to
me
in
my
one
second
more
and
i
should
have
understood
it
but
what
am
i
to
but
how
can
i
harness
and
pierre
felt
with
horror
that
the
meaning
of
all
he
had
seen
and
thought
in
the
dream
had
been
the
the
and
the
innkeeper
told
pierre
that
an
officer
had
come
with
news
that
the
french
were
already
near
mozhaysk
and
that
our
men
were
leaving
pierre
got
up
having
told
them
to
harness
and
overtake
went
on
foot
through
the
the
troops
were
moving
leaving
about
ten
thousand
wounded
behind
there
were
wounded
in
the
at
the
windows
of
the
and
the
streets
were
crowded
with
in
the
around
carts
that
were
to
take
some
of
the
wounded
and
blows
could
be
pierre
offered
the
use
of
his
which
had
overtaken
to
a
wounded
general
he
and
drove
with
him
to
on
the
way
pierre
was
told
of
the
death
of
his
anatole
and
of
that

once
on
a
very
important
without

pierre
took
a
cab
and
drove
to
see
the
moscow
count
rostopchin
had
only
that
morning
returned
to
town
from
his
summer
villa
at
the
anteroom
and

his
house

full
of
officials
who
had
been
summoned
or
had
come
for
vasilchikov
and
platov
had
already
seen
the
count
and
explained
to
him
that
it
was
impossible
to
defend
moscow
and
that
it
would
have
to
be
though
this
news
was
being
concealed
from
the
the
heads
of
the
various
government
that
moscow
would
soon
be
in
the
just
as
count
rostopchin
himself
knew
and
to
escape
personal
responsibility
they
had
all
come
to
the
governor
to
ask
how
they
were
to
deal
with
their
various
as
pierre
was
entering
the
reception
room
a
courier
from
the
army

out
of
private
in
answer
to
questions
with
which
he
was

a
despairing
gesture
with
his
hand
and
passed
through
the
while
waiting
in
the
reception
room
pierre
with
weary
eyes
watched
the
various
old
and
military
and
who
were

seemed
dissatisfied
and
pierre
went
up
to
a
group
of
one
of
whom

after
greeting
pierre
they
continued
their
sent
out
and
brought

of

replied
the
first
what
does
he
mean
by
of
my
eyes
was
sore
but
now
i
am
on
the
lookout
with
asked
count
had
a
replied
the
adjutant
was
very
much
upset
when
i
told
him
people
had
come
to
ask
what
was
the
matter
with
by
the
he
added
addressing
pierre
with
a
heard
that
you
have
family
troubles
and
that
the
your
have
heard
pierre
replied
what
have
you
you
know
people
often
invent
i
only
say
what
i
what
did
you
they
continued
the
adjutant
with
the
same
the
your
is
preparing
to
go
i
expect
remarked
looking
about
him
who
is
he
indicating
a
short
old
man
in
a
clean
blue
peasant
with
a
big
beard
and
eyebrows
and
a
ruddy
a
that
is
to
the
restaurant
perhaps
you
have
heard
of
that
affair
with
the
so
that
is
said
looking
at
the
calm
face
of
the
old
man
and
seeking
any
indication
of
his
being
a
not
he
the
father
of
the
fellow
who
wrote
the
said
the
young
man
is
in
prison
and
i
expect
it
will
go
hard
with
an
old
gentleman
wearing
a
star
and
another
a
german
wearing
a
cross
round
his
approached
the
a
complicated
you
said
the
proclamation
appeared
about
two
months
the
count
was
informed
of
he
gave
orders
to
investigate
the
gabriel
ivanovich
here
made
the
the
proclamation
had
passed
through
exactly
three
he
asked
whom
did
you
get
he
went
to
the
next
whom
did
you
get
and
so
on
till
he
reached
a
half
educated
you
pet
of
a
said
the
adjutant
asked
gave
it
and
the
point
is
that
we
knew
whom
he
had
it
he
could
only
have
had
it
from
the
but
evidently
they
had
come
to
some
he
no
i
made
it
up
they
threatened
and
questioned
but
he
stuck
to
made
it
up
and
so
it
was
reported
to
the
who
sent
for
the
whom
did
you
get
the
wrote
it
you
know
the
said
the
adjutant
with
a
smile
of
flared
up
just
think
of
the
and
the
count
wanted
him
to
say
it
was
from
i
said
at
rejoined
the
adjutant
in
had
his
own
sins
to
answer
for
without
that
and
that
is
why
he
has
been
but
the
point
is
that
the
count
was
much
could
you
have
written
it
said
and
he
took
up
the
hamburg
gazette
that
was
lying
on
the
it
you
did
not
write
it
yourself
but
translated
and
translated
it
because
you
even
know
you
and
what
do
you
said
have
not
read
any
i
made
it
up
a
traitor
and
have
you
and
be
say
from
whom
you
had
have
seen
no
i
made
it
up
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
count
had
the
father
but
the
fellow
stuck
to
he
was
sent
for
trial
and
condemned
to
hard
i
now
the
father
has
come
to
intercede
for
but
a
you
know
that
sort
of
a
dandy
and
he
attended
some
lectures
somewhere
and
imagines
that
the
devil
is
no
match
for
the
sort
of
fellow
he
his
father
keeps
a
cookshop
here
by
the
stone
and
you
know
there
was
a
large
icon
of
god
almighty
painted
with
a
scepter
in
one
hand
and
an
orb
in
the
he
took
that
icon
home
with
him
for
a
few
days
and
what
did
he
he
found
some
scoundrel
of
a
chapter
xi
in
the
middle
of
this
fresh
tale
pierre
was
summoned
to
the
commander
in
when
he
entered
the
private
room
count
puckering
his
was
rubbing
his
forehead
and
eyes
with
his
a
short
man
was
saying
but
when
pierre
entered
he
stopped
speaking
and
went
how
do
you
great
said
rostopchin
as
soon
as
the
short
man
had
left
the
have
heard
of
your
but
not
the
between
mon
do
you
belong
to
the
he
went
on
as
though
there
were
something
wrong
about
it
which
he
nevertheless
intended
to
pierre
remained
am
well
my
but
i
am
aware
that
there
are
masons
and
i
hope
that
you
are
not
one
of
those
who
on
pretense
of
saving
mankind
wish
to
ruin
i
am
a
pierre
you
mon
i
expect
you
know
that
speranski
and
magnitski
have
been
deported
to
their
proper
klyucharev
has
been
treated
in
the
same
and
so
have
others
who
on
the
plea
of
building
up
the
temple
of
solomon
have
tried
to
destroy
the
temple
of
their
you
can
understand
that
there
are
reasons
for
this
and
that
i
could
not
have
exiled
the
postmaster
had
he
not
been
a
harmful
it
has
now
come
to
my
knowledge
that
you
lent
him
your
carriage
for
his
removal
from
and
that
you
have
even
accepted
papers
from
him
for
safe
i
like
you
and
wish
you
any
harm
you
are
only
half
my
advise
as
a
father
to
cease
all
communication
with
men
of
that
stamp
and
to
leave
here
as
soon
as
what
did
klyucharev
do
asked
is
for
me
to
but
not
for
you
to
shouted
he
is
accused
of
circulating
proclamation
it
is
not
proved
that
he
did
said
pierre
without
looking
at
we
rostopchin
shouted
at
pierre
louder
than
frowning
is
a
renegade
and
a
traitor
who
will
be
punished
as
he
said
he
with
the
vindictive
heat
with
which
people
speak
when
recalling
an
i
did
not
summon
you
to
discuss
my
but
to
give
you
an
order
if
you
prefer
i
beg
you
to
leave
the
town
and
break
off
all
communication
with
such
men
as
and
i
will
knock
the
nonsense
out
of
but
probably
realizing
that
he
was
shouting
at
bezukhov
who
so
far
was
not
guilty
of
he
taking
hand
in
a
friendly
are
on
the
eve
of
a
public
disaster
and
i
time
to
be
polite
to
everybody
who
has
business
with
my
head
is
sometimes
in
a
mon
what
are
you
doing
answered
pierre
without
raising
his
eyes
or
changing
the
thoughtful
expression
of
his
the
count
word
of
friendly
mon
be
off
as
soon
as
you
all
i
have
to
tell
happy
he
who
has
ears
to
my
dear
by
the
he
shouted
through
the
doorway
after
it
true
that
the
countess
has
fallen
into
the
clutches
of
the
holy
fathers
of
the
society
of
pierre
did
not
answer
and
left
room
more
sullen
and
angry
than
he
had
ever
before
shown
when
he
reached
home
it
was
already
getting
some
eight
people
had
come
to
see
him
that
the
secretary
of
a
the
colonel
of
his
his
his
and
various
they
all
had
business
with
pierre
and
wanted
decisions
from
pierre
did
not
understand
and
was
not
interested
in
any
of
these
questions
and
only
answered
them
in
order
to
get
rid
of
these
when
left
alone
at
last
he
opened
and
read
his
the
soldiers
at
the
prince
andrew
that
old
simplicity
is
submission
to
suffering
is
the
meaning
of
one
must
my
wife
is
getting
one
must
forget
and
and
going
to
his
bed
he
threw
himself
on
it
without
undressing
and
immediately
fell
when
he
awoke
next
morning
the
came
to
inform
him
that
a
special
a
police
had
come
from
count
rostopchin
to
know
whether
count
bezukhov
had
left
or
was
leaving
the
a
dozen
persons
who
had
business
with
pierre
were
awaiting
him
in
the
drawing

hurriedly
instead
of
going
to
see
went
to
the
back
porch
and
out
through
the
from
that
time
till
the
end
of
the
destruction
of

all
the
search

or
knew

remained
in
moscow
till
the
first
of
that
till
the
eve
of
the
entry
into
the
after
petya
had
joined
regiment
of
cossacks
and
left
for
belaya
tserkov
where
that
regiment
was
the
countess
was
seized
with
the
thought
that
both
her
sons
were
at
the
had
both
gone
from
under

today
or
tomorrow
either
or
both
of
them
might

the
three
sons
of
one
of
her

her
that
summer
for
the
first
time
with
cruel
she
tried
to
get
nicholas
back
and
wished
to
go
herself
to
join
or
to
get
him
an
appointment
somewhere
in
but
neither
of
these
proved
petya
could
not
return
unless
his
regiment
did
so
or
unless
he
was
transferred
to
another
regiment
on
active
nicholas
was
somewhere
with
the
army
and
had
not
sent
a
word
since
his
last
in
which
he
had
given
a
detailed
account
of
his
meeting
with
princess
the
countess
did
not
sleep
at
or
when
she
did
fall
asleep
dreamed
that
she
saw
her
sons
lying
after
many
consultations
and
the
count
at
last
devised
means
to
tranquillize
he
got
petya
transferred
from
regiment
to
which
was
in
training
near
though
petya
would
remain
in
the
this
transfer
would
give
the
countess
the
consolation
of
seeing
at
least
one
of
her
sons
under
her
and
she
hoped
to
arrange
matters
for
her
petya
so
as
not
to
let
him
go
but
always
get
him
appointed
to
places
where
he
could
not
possibly
take
part
in
a
as
long
as
nicholas
alone
was
in
danger
the
countess
imagined
that
she
loved
her
more
than
all
her
other
children
and
even
reproached
herself
for
but
when
her
the
scapegrace
who
had
been
bad
at
was
always
breaking
things
in
the
house
and
making
himself
a
nuisance
to
that
petya
with
his
merry
black
eyes
and
fresh
rosy
cheeks
where
soft
down
was
just
beginning
to
he
was
thrown
amid
those
cruel
men
who
were
fighting
somewhere
about
something
and
apparently
finding
pleasure
in
his
mother
thought
she
loved
him
much
than
all
her
other
the
nearer
the
time
came
for
petya
to
the
more
uneasy
grew
the
she
began
to
think
she
would
never
live
to
see
such
the
presence
of
of
her
beloved
or
even
of
her
husband
irritated
do
i
want
with
i
want
no
one
but
she
at
the
end
of
august
the
rostovs
received
another
letter
from
he
wrote
from
the
province
of
voronezh
where
he
had
been
sent
to
procure
but
that
letter
did
not
set
the
countess
at
knowing
that
one
son
was
out
of
danger
she
became
the
more
anxious
about
though
by
the
twentieth
of
august
nearly
all
the
acquaintances
had
left
and
though
everybody
tried
to
persuade
the
countess
to
get
away
as
quickly
as
she
would
not
hear
of
leaving
before
her
her
adored
on
the
of
august
he
the
passionate
tenderness
with
which
his
mother
received
him
did
not
please
the
though
she
concealed
from
him
her
intention
of
keeping
him
under
her
petya
guessed
her
and
instinctively
fearing
that
he
might
give
way
to
emotion
when
with
as
he
termed
it
to
treated
her
avoided
and
during
his
stay
in
moscow
attached
himself
exclusively
to
natasha
for
whom
he
had
always
had
a
particularly
brotherly
almost
owing
to
the
customary
carelessness
nothing
was
ready
for
their
departure
by
the
of
august
and
the
carts
that
were
to
come
from
their
ryazan
and
moscow
estates
to
remove
their
household
belongings
did
not
arrive
till
the
from
the
till
the
all
moscow
was
in
a
bustle
and
every
day
thousands
of
men
wounded
at
borodino
were
brought
in
by
the
dorogomilov
gate
and
taken
to
various
parts
of
and
thousands
of
carts
conveyed
the
inhabitants
and
their
possessions
out
by
the
other
in
spite
of
or
because
of
them
or
independently
of
the
strangest
and
most
contradictory
rumors
were
current
in
the
some
said
that
no
one
was
to
be
allowed
to
leave
the
others
on
the
contrary
said
that
all
the
icons
had
been
taken
out
of
the
churches
and
everybody
was
to
be
ordered
to
some
said
there
had
been
another
battle
after
borodino
at
which
the
french
had
been

others
on
the
contrary
reported
that
the
russian
army
had
been

talked
about
the
moscow
militia
preceded
by
the
would
go
to
the
three
others
whispered
that
augustin
had
been
forbidden
to
that
traitors
had
been
that
the
peasants
were
rioting
and
robbing
people
on
their
way
from
and
so
but
all
this
was
only
in
reality
the
council
of
at
which
it
was
decided
to
abandon
had
not
yet
been
both
those
who
went
away
and
those
who
remained
behind
though
they
did
not
show
that
moscow
would
certainly
be
and
that
they
ought
to
get
away
as
quickly
as
possible
and
save
their
it
was
felt
that
everything
would
suddenly
break
up
and
but
up
to
the
first
of
september
nothing
had
done
as
a
criminal
who
is
being
led
to
execution
knows
that
he
must
die
but
yet
looks
about
him
and
straightens
the
cap
that
is
awry
on
his
so
moscow
involuntarily
continued
its
wonted
though
it
knew
that
the
time
of
its
destruction
was
near
when
the
conditions
of
life
to
which
its
people
were
accustomed
to
submit
would
be
completely
during
the
three
days
preceding
the
occupation
of
moscow
the
whole
rostov
family
was
absorbed
in
various
the
head
of
the
count
ilya
continually
drove
about
the
city
collecting
the
current
rumors
from
all
sides
and
gave
superficial
and
hasty
orders
at
home
about
the
preparations
for
their
the
countess
watched
the
things
being
was
dissatisfied
with
was
constantly
in
pursuit
of
petya
who
was
always
running
away
from
and
was
jealous
of
natasha
with
whom
he
spent
all
his
sonya
alone
directed
the
practical
side
of
matters
by
getting
things
but
of
late
sonya
had
been
particularly
sad
and
letter
in
which
he
mentioned
princess
mary
had
in
her
joyous
comments
from
the
who
saw
an
intervention
of
providence
in
this
meeting
of
the
princess
and
was
never
pleased
at
engagement
to
said
the
i
always
wanted
nicholas
to
marry
the
and
had
a
presentiment
that
it
would
what
a
good
thing
it
would
sonya
felt
that
this
was
that
the
only
possibility
of
retrieving
the
affairs
was
by
nicholas
marrying
a
rich
and
that
the
princess
was
a
good
it
was
very
bitter
for
but
despite
her
or
perhaps
just
because
of
she
took
on
herself
all
the
difficult
work
of
directing
the
storing
and
packing
of
their
things
and
was
busy
for
whole
the
count
and
countess
turned
to
her
when
they
had
any
orders
to
petya
and
natasha
on
the
far
from
helping
their
were
generally
a
nuisance
and
a
hindrance
to
almost
all
day
long
the
house
resounded
with
their
running
their
and
their
spontaneous
they
laughed
and
were
gay
not
because
there
was
any
reason
to
but
because
gaiety
and
mirth
were
in
their
hearts
and
so
everything
that
happened
was
a
cause
for
gaiety
and
laughter
to
petya
was
in
high
spirits
because
having
left
home
a
boy
he
had
returned
everybody
told
a
fine
young
because
he
was
at
because
he
had
left
belaya
tserkov
where
there
was
no
hope
of
soon
taking
part
in
a
battle
and
had
come
to
moscow
where
there
was
to
be
fighting
in
a
few
and
chiefly
because
whose
lead
he
always
was
in
high
natasha
was
gay
because
she
had
been
sad
too
long
and
now
nothing
reminded
her
of
the
cause
of
her
and
because
she
was
feeling
she
was
also
happy
because
she
had
someone
to
adore
the
adoration
of
others
was
a
lubricant
the
wheels
of
her
machine
needed
to
make
them
run
and
petya
adored
above
they
were
gay
because
there
was
a
war
near
there
would
be
fighting
at
the
town
arms
were
being
given
everybody
was
away
and
in
general
something
extraordinary
was
and
that
is
always
especially
to
the
chapter
xiii
on
the
of
everything
in
the
house
seemed
all
the
doors
were
all
the
furniture
was
being
carried
out
or
moved
and
the
mirrors
and
pictures
had
been
taken
there
were
trunks
in
the
and
wrapping
and
ropes
were
scattered
the
peasants
and
house
serfs
carrying
out
the
things
were
treading
heavily
on
the
parquet
the
yard
was
crowded
with
peasant
some
loaded
high
and
already
corded
others
still
the
voices
and
footsteps
of
the
many
servants
and
of
the
peasants
who
had
come
with
the
carts
resounded
as
they
shouted
to
one
another
in
the
yard
and
in
the
the
count
had
been
out
since
the
countess
had
a
headache
brought
on
by
all
the
noise
and
turmoil
and
was
lying
down
in
the
new
sitting
room
with
a
vinegar
compress
on
her
petya
was
not
at
he
had
gone
to
visit
a
friend
with
whom
he
meant
to
obtain
a
transfer
from
the
militia
to
the
active
sonya
was
in
the
ballroom
looking
after
the
packing
of
the
glass
and
natasha
was
sitting
on
the
floor
of
her
dismantled
room
with
and
scarves
strewn
all
about
gazing
fixedly
at
the
floor
and
holding
in
her
hands
the
old
ball
dress
out
of
which
she
had
worn
at
her
first
petersburg
natasha
was
ashamed
of
doing
nothing
when
everyone
else
was
so
and
several
times
that
morning
had
tried
to
set
to
but
her
heart
was
not
in
and
she
could
not
and
did
not
know
how
to
do
anything
except
with
all
her
heart
and
all
her
for
a
while
she
had
stood
beside
sonya
while
the
china
was
being
packed
and
tried
to
but
soon
gave
it
up
and
went
to
her
room
to
pack
her
own
at
first
she
found
it
amusing
to
give
away
dresses
and
ribbons
to
the
but
when
that
was
done
and
what
was
left
had
still
to
be
she
found
it
you
you
and
when
dunyasha
willingly
promised
to
do
it
all
for
natasha
sat
down
on
the
took
her
old
ball
and
fell
into
a
reverie
quite
unrelated
to
what
ought
to
have
occupied
her
thoughts
she
was
roused
from
her
reverie
by
the
talk
of
the
maids
in
the
next
room
was
and
by
the
sound
of
their
hurried
footsteps
going
to
the
back
natasha
got
up
and
looked
out
of
the
an
enormously
long
row
of
carts
full
of
wounded
men
had
stopped
in
the
the
the
old
the
and
scullions
stood
at
the
staring
at
the
throwing
a
clean
pocket
handkerchief
over
her
hair
and
holding
an
end
of
it
in
each
went
out
into
the
the
former
old
mavra
had
stepped
out
of
the
crowd
by
the
gone
up
to
a
cart
with
a
hood
constructed
of
bast
and
was
speaking
to
a
pale
young
officer
who
lay
natasha
moved
a
few
steps
forward
and
stopped
still
holding
her
and
listened
to
what
the
housekeeper
was
you
have
nobody
in
she
was
would
be
more
comfortable
somewhere
in
a
in
for
the
family
are
know
if
it
would
be
replied
the
officer
in
a
weak
is
our
commanding
ask
and
he
pointed
to
a
stout
major
who
was
walking
back
along
the
street
past
the
row
of
natasha
glanced
with
frightened
eyes
at
the
face
of
the
wounded
officer
and
at
once
went
to
meet
the
the
wounded
men
stay
in
our
she
the
major
raised
his
hand
to
his
cap
with
a
one
do
you
said
screwing
up
his
eyes
and
natasha
quietly
repeated
her
and
her
face
and
whole
manner
were
so
though
she
was
still
holding
the
ends
of
her
that
the
major
ceased
smiling
and
after
some
as
if
considering
in
how
far
the
thing
was
in
the
why
they
he
with
a
slight
inclination
of
her
natasha
stepped
back
quickly
to
mavra
who
stood
talking
compassionately
to
the
he
says
they
whispered
the
cart
in
which
the
officer
lay
was
turned
into
the
and
dozens
of
carts
with
wounded
men
began
at
the
invitation

into

of

the
count
gave
a
similar
order
to
the
and
the
at
dinner
petya
having
returned
home
told
them
the
news
he
had
he
said
the
people
had
been
getting
arms
in
the
and
that
though
broadsheet
had
said
that
he
would
sound
a
call
two
or
three
days
in
the
order
had
certainly
already
been
given
for
everyone
to
go
armed
to
the
three
hills
and
that
there
would
be
a
big
battle
the
countess
looked
with
timid
horror
at
her
excited
face
as
he
said
she
realized
that
if
she
said
a
word
about
his
not
going
to
the
battle
knew
he
enjoyed
the
thought
of
the
impending
he
would
say
something
about
and
the
and
obstinate
which
there
would
be
no
and
her
plans
would
be
and
hoping
to
arrange
to
leave
before
then
and
take
petya
with
her
as
their
protector
and
she
did
not
answer
but
after
dinner
called
the
count
aside
and
implored
him
with
tears
to
take
her
away
that
very
night
if
with
a
involuntary
loving
cunning
who
till
then
had
not
shown
any
said
that
she
would
die
of
fright
if
they
did
not
leave
that
very
without
any
pretense
she
was
now
afraid
of
chapter
xiv
madame
who
had
been
out
to
visit
her
increased
the
fears
still
more
by
telling
what
she
had
seen
at
a
spirit
in
myasnitski
when
returning
by
that
street
she
had
been
unable
to
pass
because
of
a
drunken
crowd
rioting
in
front
of
the
she
had
taken
a
cab
and
driven
home
by
a
side
street
and
the
cabman
had
told
her
that
the
people
were
breaking
open
the
barrels
at
the
drink
having
received
orders
to
do
after
dinner
the
whole
rostov
household
set
to
work
with
enthusiastic
haste
packing
their
belongings
and
preparing
for
their
the
old
suddenly
setting
to
kept
passing
from
the
yard
to
the
house
and
back
shouting
confused
instructions
to
the
hurrying
and
flurrying
them
still
petya
directed
things
in
the
owing
to
the
contradictory
lost
her
head
and
did
not
know
what
to
the
servants
ran
noisily
about
the
house
and
shouting
and
with
the
ardor
characteristic
of
all
she
did
suddenly
set
to
work
at
first
her
intervention
in
the
business
of
packing
was
received
everybody
expected
some
prank
from
her
and
did
not
wish
to
obey
but
she
resolutely
and
passionately
demanded
grew
angry
and
nearly
cried
because
they
did
not
heed
and
at
last
succeeded
in
making
them
believe
her
first
which
cost
her
immense
effort
and
established
her
was
the
packing
of
the
the
count
had
valuable
gobelin
tapestries
and
persian
carpets
in
the
when
natasha
set
to
work
two
cases
were
standing
open
in
the
one
almost
full
up
with
the
other
with
there
was
also
much
china
standing
on
the
and
still
more
was
being
brought
in
from
the
a
third
case
was
needed
and
servants
had
gone
to
fetch
wait
a
pack
everything
into
said
we
have
tried
said
the
wait
a
and
natasha
began
rapidly
taking
out
of
the
case
dishes
and
plates
wrapped
in
dishes
must
go
in
here
among
the
said
a
mercy
if
we
can
get
the
carpets
alone
into
three
said
the
and
natasha
began
rapidly
and
deftly
sorting
out
the
said
putting
aside
some
plates
of
kiev
these
must
go
among
the
she
referring
to
the
saxony
china
leave
it
get
it
all
urged
sonya
a
young
lady
she
remarked
the
but
natasha
would
not
give
she
turned
everything
out
and
began
quickly
deciding
that
the
inferior
russian
carpets
and
unnecessary
crockery
should
not
be
taken
at
when
everything
had
been
taken
out
of
the
they
recommenced
and
it
turned
out
that
when
the
cheaper
things
not
worth
taking
had
nearly
all
been
the
valuable
ones
really
did
all
go
into
the
two
only
the
lid
of
the
case
containing
the
carpets
would
not
shut
a
few
more
things
might
have
been
taken
but
natasha
insisted
on
having
her
own
she
made
the
assistant
and
she
had
drawn
into
the
business
of
on
the
and
made
desperate
efforts
said
see
you
were
but
just
take
out
the
top
cried
with
one
hand
holding
back
the
hair
that
hung
over
her
perspiring
while
with
the
other
she
pressed
down
the
press
she
the
carpets
yielded
and
the
lid
clapping
her
screamed
with
delight
and
tears
fell
from
her
but
this
only
lasted
a
she
at
once
set
to
work
afresh
and
they
now
trusted
her
the
count
was
not
angry
even
when
they
told
him
that
natasha
had
countermanded
an
order
of
and
the
servants
now
came
to
her
to
ask
whether
a
cart
was
sufficiently
and
whether
it
might
be
corded
thanks
to
directions
the
work
now
went
on
unnecessary
things
were
and
the
most
valuable
packed
as
compactly
as
but
hard
as
they
all
worked
till
quite
late
that
they
could
not
get
everything
the
countess
had
fallen
asleep
and
the
having
put
off
their
departure
till
next
went
to
sonya
and
natasha
slept
in
the
sitting
room
without

night

man
was
driven
down
the
and
mavra
who
was
standing
at

with
a

was
quite
covered
by
an

and
two
soldiers
followed
the

mavra

very
she
the

hopeless

must
ask

the
old

down
from

went
up

invited
them
to
take
the
wounded
man
into

masters
she
but
they
had
to
avoid
carrying
the
man
and
so
they

chapter
xv
last
day
had
it
was
a
clear
bright
autumn
a
the
church
bells
everywhere
were
ringing
for
just
as
usual
on
nobody
seemed
yet
to
realize
what
awaited
the
only
two
things
indicated
the
social
condition
of
that
is
the
poor
and
the
price
of
an
enormous
crowd
of
factory
house
and
with
whom
some
and
gentry
were
had
gone
early
that
morning
to
the
three
having
waited
there
for
rostopchin
who
did
not
turn
they
became
convinced
that
moscow
would
be
and
then
dispersed
all
about
the
town
to
the
public
houses
and
prices
too
that
day
indicated
the
state
of
the
price
of
of
of
carts
and
kept
but
the
value
of
paper
money
and
city
articles
kept
so
that
by
midday
there
were
instances
of
carters
removing
valuable
such
as
and
receiving
in
payment
a
half
of
what
they
while
peasant
horses
were
fetching
five
hundred
rubles
and
and
bronzes
were
being
given
away
for
in
the
staid
house
the
dissolution
of
former
conditions
of
life
was
but
little
as
to
the
serfs
the
only
indication
was
that
three
out
of
their
huge
retinue
disappeared
during
the
but
nothing
was
and
as
to
the
value
of
their
the
thirty
peasant
carts
that
had
come
in
from
their
estates
and
which
many
people
envied
proved
to
be
extremely
valuable
and
they
were
offered
enormous
sums
of
money
for
not
only
were
huge
sums
offered
for
the
horses
and
but
on
the
previous
evening
and
early
in
the
morning
of
the
first
of
orderlies
and
servants
sent
by
wounded
officers
came
to
the
and
wounded
men
dragged
themselves
there
from
the
and
from
neighboring
houses
where
they
were
entreating
the
servants
to
try
to
get
them
a
lift
out
of
the
to
whom
these
entreaties
were
though
he
was
sorry
for
the
resolutely
saying
that
he
dare
not
even
mention
the
matter
to
the
pity
these
wounded
men
as
one
it
was
evident
that
if
they
were
given
one
cart
there
would
be
no
reason
to
refuse
or
all
the
carts
and
own
carriages
as
thirty
carts
could
not
save
all
the
wounded
and
in
the
general
catastrophe
one
could
not
disregard
oneself
and
own
so
thought
the
on
his
on
waking
up
that
morning
count
ilya
rostov
left
his
bedroom
so
as
not
to
wake
the
countess
who
had
fallen
asleep
only
toward
and
came
out
to
the
porch
in
his
lilac
silk
dressing
in
the
yard
stood
the
carts
ready
the
carriages
were
at
the
front
the
stood
at
the
porch
talking
to
an
elderly
orderly
and
to
a
pale
young
officer
with
a
bandaged
on
seeing
the
count
the
domo
made
a
significant
and
stern
gesture
to
them
both
to
go
is
everything
asked
the
and
stroking
his
bald
head
he
looked
at
the
officer
and
the
orderly
and
nodded
to
liked
to
see
new
can
harness
at
your
as
soon
as
the
countess
wakes
be
god
what
is
he
turning
to
the
you
staying
in
my
the
officer
came
nearer
and
suddenly
his
face
flushed
be
so
good
as
to
allow
for
to
get
into
some
corner
of
one
of
your
i
have
nothing
here
with
i
shall
be
all
right
on
a
loaded
before
the
officer
had
finished
speaking
the
orderly
made
the
same
request
on
behalf
of
his
said
the
count
shall
be
very
very
see
to
just
unload
one
or
two
what
of
do
said
the
muttering
some
indefinite
but
at
the
same
moment
an
expression
of
warm
gratitude
on
the
face
had
already
sealed
the
the
count
looked
around
in
the
at
the
at
the
window
of
the
wounded
officers
and
their
orderlies
were
to
be
they
were
all
looking
at
the
count
and
moving
toward
the
step
into
the
your
said
the
are
your
orders
about
the
the
count
went
into
the
house
with
repeating
his
order
not
to
refuse
the
wounded
who
asked
for
a
never
some
of
the
things
can
be
he
added
in
a
confidential
as
though
afraid
of
being
at
nine
the
countess
woke
and
matrena
who
had
been
her
maid
before
her
marriage
and
now
performed
a
sort
of
chief
duty
for
came
to
say
that
madame
schoss
was
much
offended
and
the
young
summer
dresses
could
not
be
left
on
the
countess
learned
that
madame
schoss
was
offended
because
her
trunk
had
been
taken
down
from
its
and
all
the
loads
were
being
uncorded
and
the
luggage
taken
out
of
the
carts
to
make
room
for
wounded
men
whom
the
count
in
the
simplicity
of
his
heart
had
ordered
that
they
should
take
with
the
countess
sent
for
her
is
my
i
hear
that
the
luggage
is
being
i
wanted
to
tell
countess
an
officer
came
to
me
to
ask
for
a
few
carts
for
the
after
ours
are
things
that
can
be
bought
but
think
what
being
left
behind
means
to
really
in
our
own
asked
them
in
ourselves
and
there
are
officers
among
you
i
my
let
them
be
the
the
count
spoke
as
he
always
did
when
talking
of
money
the
countess
was
accustomed
to
this
tone
as
a
precursor
of
news
of
something
detrimental
to
the
such
as
the
building
of
a
new
gallery
or
the
inauguration
of
a
private
theater
or
an
she
was
accustomed
always
to
oppose
anything
announced
in
that
timid
tone
and
considered
it
her
duty
to
do
she
assumed
her
dolefully
submissive
manner
and
said
to
her
to
you
have
managed
matters
so
that
we
are
getting
nothing
for
the
and
now
you
wish
to
throw
away
all
the
you
said
yourself
that
we
have
a
hundred
thousand
worth
of
things
in
the
i
my
i
do
as
you
the
business
to
look
after
the
they
know
look
at
the
lopukhins
they
cleared
out
everything
two
days
what
other
people
only
we
who
are
such
if
you
have
no
pity
on
have
some
for
the
flourishing
his
arms
in
despair
the
count
left
the
room
without
what
are
you
doing
that
asked
who
had
followed
him
into
her
what
business
is
it
of
muttered
the
count
i
said
does
mamma
business
is
it
of
cried
the
natasha
stepped
up
to
the
window
and
berg
coming
to
see
said
looking
out
of
the
chapter
xvi
the
was
already
a
colonel
wearing
the
orders
of
vladimir
and
and
he
still
filled
the
quiet
and
agreeable
post
of
assistant
to
the
head
of
the
staff
of
the
assistant
commander
of
the
first
division
of
the
second
on
the
first
of
september
he
had
come
to
moscow
from
the
he
had
nothing
to
do
in
but
he
had
noticed
that
everyone
in
the
army
was
asking
for
leave
to
visit
moscow
and
had
something
to
do
so
he
considered
it
necessary
to
ask
for
leave
of
absence
for
family
and
domestic
berg
drove
up
to
his
house
in
his
spruce
little
trap
with
a
pair
of
sleek
exactly
like
those
of
a
certain
he
looked
attentively
at
the
carts
in
the
yard
and
while
going
up
to
the
porch
took
out
a
clean
pocket
handkerchief
and
tied
a
knot
in
from
the
anteroom
berg
ran
with
smooth
though
impatient
steps
into
the
drawing
where
he
embraced
the
kissed
the
hands
of
natasha
and
and
hastened
to
inquire
after
at
a
time
like
said
the
tell
us
the
is
the
army
retreating
or
will
there
be
another
almighty
alone
can
decide
the
fate
of
our
said
army
is
burning
with
a
spirit
of
heroism
and
the
so
to
have
now
assembled
in
no
one
knows
what
is
but
in
general
i
can
tell
that
such
a
heroic
the
truly
antique
valor
of
the
russian
which
corrected
shown
or
displayed
in
the
battle
of
the
there
are
no
words
worthy
to
do
it
i
tell
smote
himself
on
the
breast
as
a
general
he
had
heard
speaking
had
but
berg
did
it
a
trifle
late
for
he
should
have
struck
his
breast
at
the
words
tell
you
frankly
that
the
far
from
having
to
urge
the
men
on
or

closer

face
full
of

at
the

pace
at

she
used
to
run
when
playing
at
ran
through
the
ballroom
to
the
anteroom
and
downstairs
into
the
the
servants
gathered
round
but
could
not
believe
the
strange
order
she
brought
them
until
the
count
in
his
confirmed
the
order
to
give
up
all
the
carts
to
the
wounded
and
take
the
trunks
to
the
when
they
understood
that
order
the
servants
set
to
work
at
this
new
task
with
pleasure
and
it
no
longer
seemed
strange
to
them
but
on
the
contrary
it
seemed
the
only
thing
that
could
be
just
as
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
it
had
not
seemed
strange
to
anyone
that
the
wounded
should
be
left
behind
and
the
goods
carted
away
but
that
had
seemed
the
only
thing
to
the
whole
as
if
to
atone
for
not
having
done
it
set
eagerly
to
work
at
the
new
task
of
placing
the
wounded
in
the
the
wounded
dragged
themselves
out
of
their
rooms
and
stood
with
pale
but
happy
faces
round
the
the
news
that
carts
were
to
be
had
spread
to
the
neighboring
from
which
wounded
men
began
to
come
into
the
many
of
the
wounded
asked
them
not
to
unload
the
carts
but
only
to
let
them
sit
on
the
top
of
the
but
the
work
of
once
could
not
be
it
seemed
not
to
matter
whether
all
or
only
half
the
things
were
left
cases
full
of
and
mirrors
that
had
been
so
carefully
packed
the
night
before
now
lay
about
the
and
still
they
went
on
searching
for
and
finding
possibilities
of
unloading
this
or
that
and
letting
the
wounded
have
another
and
yet
another

and
natasha
was
in
a
state
of
rapturous
excitement

as

not
known

a
long

there
was
a
doubt
as
to
where
count
peter

sonya
too
was
busy
all
this
but
the
aim
of
her
efforts
was
quite
different
from
she
was
putting
away
the
things
that
had
to
be
left
behind
and
making
a
list
of
them
as
the

moved
out
of

caleche
in
which
prince
andrew
was
being
taken

attention
as
it
passed
the
front
with
the
help
of
a
maid
she
was
arranging
a
seat
for
the
countess
in
the
huge
high
coach
that

down

her
eyes
in
dismay
seizing
glanced
she
at
that
moment
this
news
had
only
one
significance
for
both
of
they
knew
their
and
alarm
as
to
what
would
happen
if
she
heard
this
news
stifled
all
sympathy
for
the
man

both
does
not

but
he
is
going

the
countess
put
her
arms
around
sonya
and
began
to
ways
of
god

past
finding
she
feeling
that
the
almighty
hitherto
was
becoming
manifest
in
all
that
was
now
taking
everything
is
the
asked
as
with
animated
face
she
ran
into
the

everything

and
the
countess
bent
over
her
reticule
to
hide
her
agitated
sonya
embraced
natasha
and
kissed

at
her

vasilich
came
into
the
drawing
room
having
closed
the

all
sat
down
and
remained
for
some
moments
silently
seated
without
looking
at

the
count
was
the
first
to
and
with
a
loud
sigh
crossed
himself
before
the
all
the
others
did
the
then
the
count
embraced
mavra
kuzminichna
and
who
were
to
remain
in
and
while
they
caught
at
his
hand
and
kissed
his
shoulder
he
patted
their
backs
lightly
with
some
vaguely
affectionate
and
comforting
the
countess
went
into
the
oratory
and
there
sonya
found
her
on
her
knees
before
the
icons
that
had
been
left
here
and
there
hanging
on
the
most
precious

which
some
family
tradition
was

being
taken
with
in
the
porch
and
in
the
yard
the
men
whom
petya
had
armed
with
swords
and
with
trousers
tucked
inside
their
high
boots
and
with
belts
and
girdles
were
taking
leave
of
those
remaining
as
is
always
the
case
at
a
much
had
been
forgotten
or
put
in
the
wrong
and
for
a
long
time
two
menservants
stood
one
on
each
side
of
the
open
door
and
the
carriage
steps
waiting
to
help
the
countess
while
maids
rushed
with
cushions
and
bundles
from
the
house
to
the
the

and
back
always
will
forget
said
the
you
know
i
sit
like
and
with
clenched
without
replying
but
with
an
aggrieved
look
on
her
hastily
got
into
the
coach
to
rearrange
the
those
said
the
swaying
his
the
old
who
was
the
only
one
the
countess
trusted
to
drive
sat
perched
up
high
on
the
box
and
did
not
so
much
as
glance
round
at
what
was
going
on
behind
from
thirty
experience
he
knew
it
would
be
some
time
yet
before
the
in
would
be
given
and
he
knew
that
even
when
it
was
said
he
would
be
stopped
once
or
twice
more
while
they
sent
back
to
fetch
something
that
had
been
and
even
after
that
he
would
again
be
stopped
and
the
countess
herself
would
lean
out
of
the
window
and
beg
him
for
the
love
of
heaven
to
drive
carefully
down
the
he
knew
all
this
and
therefore
waited
calmly
for
what
would
with
more
patience
than
the
especially
the
near
the
chestnut
who
was
pawing
the
ground
and
champing

folded
and
pulled

somebody

sent
for
a
traveling
and
the
countess
leaned
out
and
said
what
she
had
to
then
efim
deliberately
doffed
his
hat
and
began
crossing
the
postilion

all
the
other

at

the
high
springs
and
the
body
of
the
coach
the
footman
sprang
onto
the
box
of
the
moving
coach
which
jolted
as
it
passed
out
of
the
yard
onto
the
uneven
the
other
vehicles
jolted
in
their
and
the
procession
of
carriages
moved
up
the
in
the
the
and
the
all
crossed
themselves
as
they
passed
the
church
opposite
the
those
who
were
to
remain
in
moscow
walked
on
either
side
of
the
vehicles
seeing
the
travelers
rarely
had
natasha
experienced
so
joyful
a
feeling
as
sitting
in
the
carriage
beside
the
countess
and
gazing
at
the
slowly
receding
walls
of
agitated
occasionally
she
leaned
out
of
the
carriage
window
and
looked
back
and
then
forward
at
the
long
train
of
wounded
in
front
of
almost
at
the
head
of
the
line
she
could
see
the
raised
hood
of
prince
she
did
not
know
who
was
in
but
each
time
she
looked
at
the
procession
her
eyes
sought
that
she
knew
it
was
right
in
in
from
the
and
podnovinsk
streets
came
several
other
trains
of
vehicles
similar
to
the
and
as
they
passed
along
the
sadovaya
street
the
carriages
and
carts
formed
two
rows
as
they
were
going
round
the
sukharev
water
tower
who
was
inquisitively
and
alertly
scrutinizing
the
people
driving
or
walking
suddenly
cried
out
in
joyful
on
my
said
putting
her
head
out
of
the
carriage
and
staring
at
a
stout
man
in
a
long
who
from
his
manner
of
walking
and
moving
was
evidently
a
gentleman
in
and
who
was
passing
under
the
arch
of
the
sukharev
tower
accompanied
by
a
beardless
old
man
in
a
frieze

but
the
coachman
could
not

from
the
meshchanski
street
came
more
carts
and
and
the
rostovs
were
being
shouted
at
to
move
on
and
not
block
the
in
though
now
much
farther
off
than
the
rostovs
all
saw
someone
extraordinarily
like
a
going
down
the
street
with
head
bent
and
a
serious
face
beside
a
beardless
old
man
who
looked
like
a
that
old
man
noticed
a
face
thrust
out
of
the
carriage
window
gazing
at
and
respectfully
touching
elbow
said
something
to
him
and
pointed
to

engrossed
in

not
at

at
length
when
he
had
understood
and
looked
in
the
direction
the
old
man
he
recognized
and
following
his
first
impulse
stepped
instantly
and
rapidly
toward
the
but
having
taken
a
dozen
steps
he
seemed
to
remember
something
and
leaning
out
of
the
beamed
with
quizzical
come
we
have
recognized
this
is
she
holding
out
her
hand
to

her
outstretched
hand
and
kissed

awkwardly
as

walked
along
beside
her
while
the
coach
still
moved

in
a
surprised
and
commiserating
ask

and
looked
round
at
natasha

happy
which
he
was
conscious
without
looking
at

said

a
questioning

absently
at

an
awful
and
dropping
behind
the

he
stepped
onto

to
lean
out
of
the
window
for
a
long
beaming
at
him
with
her
slightly
happy

the
last
two

since

been
living
in
the
empty
house
of
his
deceased

is
how
it
when
he
woke
up
on
the
morning
after
his
return
to
moscow
and
his
interview
with
count
he
could
not
for
some
time
make
out
where
he
was
and
what
was
expected
of
when
he
was
informed
that
among
others
awaiting
him
in
his
reception
room
there
was
a
frenchman
who
had
brought
a
letter
from
his
the
countess
he
felt
suddenly
overcome
by
that
sense
of
confusion
and
hopelessness
to
which
he
was
apt
to
he
felt
that
everything
was
now
at
an
all
was
in
confusion
and
crumbling
to
that
nobody
was
right
or
the
future
held
and
there
was
no
escape
from
this
smiling
unnaturally
and
muttering
to
he
first
sat
down
on
the
sofa
in
an
attitude
of
then
went
to
the
door
of
the
reception
room
and
peeped
through
the
returned
flourishing
his
and
took
up
a
his
came
in
a
second
time
to
say
that
the
frenchman
who
had
brought
the
letter
from
the
countess
was
very
anxious
to
see
him
if
only
for
a
and
that
someone
from
widow
had
called
to
ask
pierre
to
take
charge
of
her
as
she
herself
was
leaving
for
the
in
a
or
of
go
and
say
i
will
come
pierre
replied
to
the
but
as
soon
as
the
man
had
left
the
room
pierre
took
up
his
hat
which
was
lying
on
the
table
and
went
out
of
his
study
by
the
other
there
was
no
one
in
the
he
went
along
the
whole
length
of
this
passage
to
the
stairs
frowning
and
rubbing
his
forehead
with
both
went
down
as
far
as
the
first
the
hall
porter
was
standing
at
the
front
from
the
landing
where
pierre
stood
there
was
a
second
staircase
leading
to
the
back
he
went
down
that
staircase
and
out
into
the
no
one
had
seen
but
there
were
some
carriages
and
as
soon
as
pierre
stepped
out
of
the
gate
the
coachmen
and
the
yard
porter
noticed
him
and
raised
their
caps
to
when
he
felt
he
was
being
looked
at
he
behaved
like
an
ostrich
which
hides
its
head
in
a
bush
in
order
not
to
be
he
hung
his
head
and
quickening
his
pace
went
down
the
of
all
the
affairs
awaiting
pierre
that
day
the
sorting
of
joseph
books
and
papers
appeared
to
him
the
most
he
hired
the
first
cab
he
met
and
told
the
driver
to
go
to
the
where
the
widow
house
continually
turning
round
to
look
at
the
rows
of
loaded
carts
that
were
making
their
way
from
all
sides
out
of
and
balancing
his
bulky
body
so
as
not
to
slip
out
of
the
ramshackle
old
experiencing
the
joyful
feeling
of
a
boy
escaping
from

to
talk
to
his
the
man
told
him
that
arms
were
being
distributed
today
at
the
kremlin
and
that
tomorrow
everyone
would
be
sent
out
beyond
the
three
hills
gates
and
a
great
battle
would
be
fought
having
reached
the
ponds
pierre
found
the
where
he
had
not
been
for
a
long
time
he
went
up
to
the
that
sallow
beardless
old
man

had
seen

years
before

with
a
red
wearing
a
dressing
gown
and
with
galoshes
on
his
bare

in
the

he
muttered
something
angrily
and
went
away
along

a
very
clever
man
but
has
now
grown
quite
as
your
honor
said

from
you
they
were
to
have
the
pierre
went
into
that
gloomy
study
which
he
had
entered
with
such
trepidation
in
his
the
dusty
and
untouched
since
the
death
of
joseph
bazdeev
was
now
even
gerasim
opened
one
of
the
shutters
and
left
the
room
on

round

approached
the
cupboard
in
which
the
manuscripts
were
and
took
out

once
been
one
of
the
most
the
holy
of
holies
of
the
this
was
the
authentic
scotch
acts
with
notes
and
he
sat
down
at
the
dusty
writing
having
laid
the
manuscripts
before
opened
them
closed
finally
pushed
them
and
resting
his
head
on
his
hand
sank
into
gerasim
looked
cautiously
into
the
study
several
times
and
saw
pierre
always
sitting
in
the
same
more
than
two
hours
passed
and
gerasim
took
the
liberty
of
making
a
slight
noise
at
the
door
to
attract
his
but
pierre
did
not
hear
the
cabman
to
be
your
said
rousing
himself
and
rising
he
taking
gerasim
by
a
button
of
his
coat
and
looking
down
at
the
old

and
ecstatic

unexpectedly
your

gerasim
after
thinking
for
a
all
the
rest
of
that
day
pierre
spent
alone
in
his
and
gerasim
heard
him
pacing
restlessly
from
one
corner
to
another
and
talking
to
and
he
spent
the
night
on
a
bed
made
up
for
him
being
a
servant
who
in
his
time
had
seen
many
strange
accepted
taking
up
his
residence
in
the
house
without
and
seemed
pleased
to
have
someone
to
wait
that
same
without
even
asking
himself
what
they
were
wanted
procured
a
coat
and
cap
for
and
promised
to
get
him
the
pistol
next
makar
alexeevich
came
twice
that
evening
shuffling
along
in
his
galoshes
as
far
as
the
door
and
stopped
and
looked
ingratiatingly
at
but
as
soon
as
pierre
turned
toward
him
he
wrapped
his
dressing
gown
around
him
with
a
shamefaced
and
angry
look
and
hurried
it
was
when
pierre
the
coat
which
gerasim
had
procured
for
him
and
had
disinfected
by
was
on
his
way
with
the
old
man
to
buy
the
pistol
at
the
sukharev
market
that
he
met
the
chapter
xix
order
to
retreat
through
moscow
to
the
ryazan
road
was
issued
at
night
on
the
first
of
the
first
troops
started
at
and
during
the
night
they
marched
slowly
and
steadily
without
at
those
nearing
the
town
at
the
dorogomilov
bridge
saw
ahead
of
them
masses
of
soldiers
crowding
and
hurrying
across
the
ascending
on
the
opposite
side
and
blocking
the
streets
and
while
endless
masses
of
troops
were
bearing
down
on
them
from
and
an
unreasoning
hurry
and
alarm
overcame
they
all
rushed
forward
to
the
onto
and
to
the
fords
and
the
kutuzov
himself
had
driven
round
by
side
streets
to
the
other
side
of
by
ten
in
the
morning
of
the
second
of
only
the
rear
guard
remained
in
the
dorogomilov
where
they
had
ample
the
main
army
was
on
the
other
side
of
moscow
or
beyond
at
that
very
at
ten
in
the
morning
of
the
second
of
napoleon
was
standing
among
his
troops
on
the
poklonny
hill
looking
at
the
panorama
spread
out
before
from
the
of
august
to
the
second
of
that
is
from
the
battle
of
borodino
to
the
entry
of
the
french
into
during
the
whole
of
that
memorable
there
had
been
the
extraordinary
autumn
weather
that
always
comes
as
a
when
the
sun
hangs
low
and
gives
more
heat
than
in
when
everything
shines
so
brightly
in
the
rare
clear
atmosphere
that
the
eyes
when
the
lungs
are
strengthened
and
refreshed
by
inhaling
the
aromatic
autumn
when
even
the
nights
are
and
when
in
those
dark
warm
golden
stars
startle
and
delight
us
continually
by
falling
from
the
at
ten
in
the
morning
of
the
second
of
september
this
weather
still
the
brightness
of
the
morning
was
moscow
seen
from
the
poklonny
hill
lay
spaciously
spread
out
with
her
her
and
her
and
she
seemed
to
be
living
her
usual
her
cupolas
glittering
like
stars
in
the
the
view
of
the
strange
city
with
its
peculiar
such
as
he
had
never
seen
filled
napoleon
with
the
rather
envious
and
uneasy
curiosity
men
feel
when
they
see
an
alien
form
of
life
that
has
no
knowledge
of
this
city
was
evidently
living
with
the
full
force
of
its
own
by
the
indefinite
signs
even
at
a
distinguish
a
living
body
from
a
dead
napoleon
from
the
poklonny
hill
perceived
the
throb
of
life
in
the
town
and
as
it
the
breathing
of
that
great
and
beautiful
every
russian
looking
at
moscow
feels
her
to
be
a
every
foreigner
who
sees
even
if
ignorant
of
her
significance
as
the
mother
must
feel
her
feminine
and
napoleon
felt
ville
asiatique
aux
innombrables
moscou
la
la
voila
done
cette
fameuse
il
etait
said
and
dismounting
he
ordered
a
plan
of
moscow
to
be
spread
out
before
and
summoned
lelorgne
the
asiatic
city
of
the
innumerable
holy
here
it
is
then
at
that
famous
it
was
high
town
captured
by
the
enemy
is
like
a
maid
who
has
lost
her
thought
he
had
said
so
to
tuchkov
at
from
that
point
of
view
he
gazed
at
the
oriental
beauty
he
had
not
seen
it
seemed
strange
to
him
that
his
which
had
seemed
had
at
last
been
in
the
clear
morning
light
he
gazed
now
at
the
city
and
now
at
the
considering
its
and
the
assurance
of
possessing
it
agitated
and
awed
could
it
be
he
is
this
capital
at
my
where
is
alexander
and
of
what
is
he
a
and
majestic
and
a
strange
and
majestic
in
what
light
must
i
appear
to
thought
thinking
of
his

the
reward
for
all
those
fainthearted

glancing
at
those
near
him
and
at
the
troops
who
were
approaching
and
forming
word
from
one
movement
of
my
and
that
ancient
capital
of

tsars

but
my
clemency
is
always
ready
to
descend
upon
the

must
be
magnanimous
and
truly
but
it
be
true
that
i
am
in

suddenly
here
she
is
lying
at
my
with
her
golden
domes
and
crosses
scintillating
and
twinkling
in
the
but
i
shall
spare
on
the
ancient
monuments
of
barbarism
and
despotism
i
will
inscribe
great
words
of
justice
and
it
is
just
this
which
alexander
will
feel
most
i
know
seemed
to
napoleon
that
the
chief
import
of
what
was
taking
place
lay
in
the
personal
struggle
between
himself
and
the
height
of
the
there
is
the
will
give
them
just
i
will
teach
them
the
meaning
of
true
i
will
make
generations
of
boyars
remember
their
conqueror
with
i
will
tell
the
deputation
that
i
did
and
do
desire
that
i
have
waged
war
only
against
the
false
policy
of
their
that
i
love
and
respect
alexander
and
that
in
moscow
i
will
accept
terms
of
peace
worthy
of
myself
and
of
my
i
do
not
wish
to
utilize
the
fortunes
of

to
humiliate

shall
speak

them
as
i
always
and
but
can
it
be
true
that
i
am
in
there
she
les
said
he
to
his
the
boyars
to
a
general
with
a
brilliant
suite
galloped
off
at
once
to
fetch
the
two
hours
napoleon
had
lunched
and
was
again
standing
in
the
same
place
on
the
poklonny
hill
awaiting
the
his
speech
to
the
boyars
had
already
taken
definite
shape
in
his
that
speech
was
full
of
dignity
and
greatness
as
napoleon
understood
he
was
himself
carried
away
by
the
tone
of
magnanimity
he
intended
to
adopt
toward
in
his
imagination
he
appointed
days
for
assemblies
at
the
palace
of
the
at
which
russian
notables
and
his
own
would
he
mentally
appointed
a
one
who
would
win
the
hearts
of
the
having
learned
that
there
were
many
charitable
institutions
in
moscow
he
mentally
decided
that
he
would
shower
favors
on
them
he
thought
as
in
africa
he
had
to
put
on
a
burnoose
and
sit
in
a
so
in
moscow
he
must
be
beneficent
like
the
and
in
order
finally
to
touch
the
hearts
of
the
being
like
all
frenchmen
unable
to
imagine
anything
sentimental
without
a
reference
to
ma
ma
ma
pauvre
mere
decided
that
he
would
place
an
inscription
on
all
these
establishments
in
large
establishment
is
dedicated
to
my
dear
or
it
should
be
maison
de
ma
he
am
i
really
in
here
it
lies
before
but
why
is
the
deputation
from
the
city
so
long
in
he
my
my
poor
of
my
meanwhile
an
agitated
consultation
was
being
carried
on
in
whispers
among
his
generals
and
marshals
at
the
rear
of
his
those
sent
to
fetch
the
deputation
had
returned
with
the
news
that
moscow
was
that
everyone
had
left
the
faces
of
those
who
were
not
conferring
together
were
pale
and
they
were
not
alarmed
by
the
fact
that
moscow
had
been
abandoned
by
its
inhabitants
as
that
fact
but
by
the
question
how
to
tell
the
putting
him
in
the
terrible
position
of
appearing
he
had
been
awaiting
the
boyars
so
long
in
that
there
were
drunken
mobs
left
in
moscow
but
no
one
some
said
that
a
deputation
of
some
sort
must
be
scraped
others
disputed
that
opinion
and
maintained
that
the
emperor
should
first
be
carefully
and
skillfully
and
then
told
the
will
have
to
be
all
the
said
some
gentlemen
of
the
the
position
was
the
more
awkward
because
the
meditating
upon
his
magnanimous
was
pacing
patiently
up
and
down
before
the
outspread
occasionally
glancing
along
the
road
to
moscow
from
under
his
lifted
hand
with
a
bright
and
proud
declared
the
gentlemen
of
the
shrugging
their
shoulders
but
not
venturing
to
utter
the
implied
at
last
the
tired
of
futile
his
instinct
suggesting
to
him
that
the
sublime
moment
having
been
too
long
drawn
out
was
beginning
to
lose
its
gave
a
sign
with
his
a
single
report
of
a
signaling
gun
and
the
who
were
already
spread
out
on
different
sides
of
moved
into
the
city
through
and
dorogomilov
faster
and
vying
with
one
they
moved
at
the
double
or
at
a
vanishing
amid
the
clouds
of
dust
they
raised
and
making
the
air
ring
with
a
deafening
roar
of
mingling
drawn
on
by
the
movement
of
his
troops
napoleon
rode
with
them
as
far
as
the
dorogomilov
but
there
again
stopped
dismounting
from
his
paced
for
a
long
time
by
the
awaiting
the
chapter
xx
meanwhile
moscow
was
there
were
still
people
in
perhaps
a
fiftieth
part
of
its
former
inhabitants
had
but
it
was
it
was
empty
in
the
sense
that
a
dying
queenless
hive
is
in
a
queenless
hive
no
life
is
left
though
to
a
superficial
glance
it
seems
as
much
alive
as
other
the
bees
circle
round
a
queenless
hive
in
the
hot
beams
of
the
midday
sun
as
gaily
as
around
the
living
from
a
distance
it
smells
of
honey
like
the
and
bees
fly
in
and
out
in
the
same
but
one
has
only
to
observe
that
hive
to
realize
that
there
is
no
longer
any
life
in
the
bees
do
not
fly
in
the
same
the
smell
and
the
sound
that
meet
the
beekeeper
are
not
the
to
the
tap
on
the
wall
of
the
sick
instead
of
the
former
instant
unanimous
humming
of
tens
of
thousands
of
bees
with
their
abdomens
threateningly
and
producing
by
the
rapid
vibration
of
their
wings
an
aerial
living
the
only
reply
is
a
disconnected
buzzing
from
different
parts
of
the
deserted
from
the
alighting
instead
of
the
former
spirituous
fragrant
smell
of
honey
and
and
the
warm
whiffs
of
crowded
comes
an
odor
of
emptiness
and
decay
mingling
with
the
smell
of
there
are
no
longer
sentinels
sounding
the
alarm
with
their
abdomens
and
ready
to
die
in
defense
of
the
there
is
no

this

the
evening
of
the
first
of
after
his
interview
with
count
rostopchin
had
returned
to
moscow
mortified
and
offended
because
he
had
not
been
invited
to
attend
the
council
of
and
because
kutuzov
had
paid
no
attention
to
his
offer
to
take
part
in
the
defense
of
the
amazed
also
at
the
novel
outlook
revealed
to
him
at
the
which
treated
the
tranquillity
of
the
capital
and
its
patriotic
fervor
as
not
merely
secondary
but
quite
irrelevant
and
unimportant
and
surprised
by
all
rostopchin
had
returned
to
after
supper
he
lay
down
on
a
sofa
without
and
was
awakened
soon
after
midnight
by
a
courier
bringing
him
a
letter
from
this
letter
requested
the
count
to
send
police
officers
to
guide
the
troops
through
the
as
the
army
was
retreating
to
the
ryazan
road
beyond
this
was
not
news
to
he
had
known
that
moscow
would
be
abandoned
not
merely
since
his
interview
the
previous
day
with
kutuzov
on
the
poklonny
hill
but
ever
since
the
battle
of
for
all
the
generals
who
came
to
moscow
after
that
battle
had
said
unanimously
that
it
was
impossible
to
fight
another
and
since
then
the
government
property
had
been
removed
every
and
half
the
inhabitants
had
left
the
city
with
own
yet
all
the
same
this
information
astonished
and
irritated
the
coming
as
it
did
in
the
form
of
a
simple
note
with
an
order
from
and
received
at
breaking
in
on
his
beauty
when
later
on
in
his
memoirs
count
rostopchin
explained
his
actions
at
this
he
repeatedly
says
that
he
was
then
actuated
by
two
important
to
maintain
tranquillity
in
moscow
and
expedite
the
departure
of
the
if
one
accepts
this
twofold
aim
all
actions
appear
were
the
holy
the
and
stores
of
corn
not
why
were
thousands
of
inhabitants
deceived
into
believing
that
moscow
would
not
be
given
thereby
preserve
the
tranquillity
of
the
explains
count
were
bundles
of
useless
papers
from
the
government
and

and
other
articles

explains
count
one
need
only
admit
that
public
tranquillity
is
in
danger
and
any
action
finds
a

the
horrors
of
the
reign
of
terror
were
based
only
on
solicitude
for
public

was
count
fear
for
the
tranquillity
of
moscow
based
in
what
reason
was
there
for
assuming
any
probability
of
an
uprising
in
the
the
inhabitants
were
leaving
it
and
the
retreating
troops
were
filling
why
should
that
cause
the
masses
to
neither
in
moscow
nor
anywhere
in
russia
did
anything
resembling
an
insurrection
ever
occur
when
the
enemy
entered
a
more
than
ten
thousand
people
were
still
in
moscow
on
the
first
and
second
of
and
except
for
a
mob
in
the
assembled
there
at
his
nothing
it
is
obvious
that
there
would
have
been
even
less
reason
to
expect
a
disturbance
among
the
people
if
after
the
battle
of
when
the
surrender
of
moscow
became
certain
or
at
least
rostopchin
instead
of
exciting
the
people
by
distributing
arms
and
broadsheets
had
taken
steps
to
remove
all
the
holy
the
and
and
had
told
the
population
plainly
that
the
town
would
be
though
he
had
patriotic
was
a
sanguine
and
impulsive
man
who
had
always
moved
in
the
highest
administrative
circles
and
had
no
understanding
at
all
of
the
people
he
supposed
himself
to
be
ever
since
the
entry
into
smolensk
he
had
in
imagination
been
playing
the
role
of
director
of
the
popular
feeling
of
heart
of
not
only
did
it
seem
to
him
to
all
that
he
controlled
the
external
actions
of
but
he
also
thought
he
controlled
their
mental
attitude
by
means
of
his
broadsheets
and
written
in
a
coarse
tone
which
the
people
despise
in
their
own
class
and
do
not
understand
from
those
in
rostopchin
was
so
pleased
with
the
fine
role
of
leader
of
popular
and
had
grown
so
used
to
that
the
necessity
of
relinquishing
that
role
and
abandoning
moscow
without
any
heroic
display
took
him
unawares
and
he
suddenly
felt
the
ground
slip
away
from
under
his
so
that
he
positively
did
not
know
what
to
though
he
knew
it
was
he
did
not
till
the
last
moment
wholeheartedly
believe
that
moscow
would
be
and
did
not
prepare
for
the
inhabitants
left
against
his
if
the
government
offices
were
this
was
only
done
on
the
demand
of
officials
to
whom
the
count
yielded
he
was
absorbed
in
the
role
he
had
created
for
as
is
often
the
case
with
those
gifted
with
an
ardent
though
he
had
long
known
that
moscow
would
be
abandoned
he
knew
it
only
with
his
he
did
not
believe
it
in
his
heart
and
did
not
adapt
himself
mentally
to
this
new
position
of
all
his
painstaking
and
energetic
activity
how
far
it
was
useful
and
had
any
effect
on
the
people
is
another
had
been
simply
directed
toward
arousing
in
the
masses
his
own
feeling
of
patriotic
hatred
of
the
but
when
events
assumed
their
true
historical
when
expressing
hatred
for
the
french
in
words
proved
when
it
was
not
even
possible
to
express
that
hatred
by
fighting
a
when
confidence
was
of
no
avail
in
relation
to
the
one
question
before
when
the
whole
population
streamed
out
of
moscow
as
one
abandoning
their
belongings
and
proving
by
that
negative
action
all
the
depth
of
their
national
then
the
role
chosen
by
rostopchin
suddenly
appeared
he
unexpectedly
felt
himself
and
with
no
ground
to
stand
awakened
from
his
he
received
that
peremptory
note
from
he
felt
the
more
irritated
the
more
he
felt
himself
to
all
that
he
had
been
specially
put
in
charge
the
state
property
which
he
should
have
was
still
in
moscow
and
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
take
the
whole
of
it
is
to
blame
for
who
has
let
things
come
to
such
a
he
of
i
had
everything
i
had
moscow
firmly
in
and
this
is
what
they
have
let
it
come
he
without
clearly
defining
who
the
villains
and
traitors
but
feeling
it
necessary
to
hate
those
traitors
whoever
they
might
be
who
were
to
blame
for
the
false
and
ridiculous
position
in
which
he
found
all
that
night
count
rostopchin
issued
for
which
people
came
to
him
from
all
parts
of
those
about
him
had
never
seen
the
count
so
morose
and
the
director
of
the
department
has
sent
for
from
the
from
the
from
the
from
the
foundling
the
suffragan
has
asking
for
what
are
your
orders
about
the

from
the
governor
of

from
the
superintendent
of
the
lunatic
all
night
long
such
announcements
were
continually
being
received
by
the
to
all
these
inquiries
he
gave
brief
and
angry
replies
indicating
that
orders
from
him
were
not
now
that
the
whole
carefully
prepared
by
had
now
been
ruined
by
and
that
that
somebody
would
have
to
bear
the
whole
responsibility
for
all
that
might
tell

he
said
in
reply
to
the
question
from

he
should
remain
to
guard

why
are
you
asking
silly
questions
about
the
fire
they
have
let
them
be
off
to
and
not
leave
them
to
the
the
superintendent
of
the
lunatic
asylum
has
what
are
your
let
them
go
and
let
the
lunatics
out
into
the
when
lunatics
command
our

god
evidently
means
these
other
madmen
to
be
in
reply
to
an
inquiry
about
the
convicts
in
the

rostopchin
shouted
angrily
at

nine
in

the

more
for
those
who
were
able
to
get
away
were
going
of
their
own
those
who
remained
behind
decided
for
themselves
what
they
must
the
count
ordered
his
carriage
that
he
might
drive
to
and
sat
in
his
study
with
folded
and
in
quiet
and
untroubled
times
it
seems
to
every
administrator
that
it
is
only
by
his
efforts
that
the
whole
population
under
his
rule
is
kept
and
in
this
consciousness
of
being
indispensable
every
administrator
finds
the
chief
reward
of
his
labor
and
while
the
sea
of
history
remains
calm
the
in
his
frail
holding
on
with
a
boat
hook
to
the
ship
of
the
people
and
himself
naturally
imagines
that
his
efforts
move
the
ship
he
is
holding
on
but
as
soon
as
a
storm
arises
and
the
sea
begins
to
heave
and
the
ship
to
such
a
delusion
is
no
longer
the
ship
moves
independently
with
its
own
enormous
the
boat
hook
no
longer
reaches
the
moving
and
suddenly
the
instead
of
appearing
a
ruler
and
a
source
of

an
feeble
rostopchin
felt
and
it
was
this
which
exasperated
the
superintendent
of
whom
the
crowd
had
went
in
to
see
him
at
the
same
time
as
an
adjutant
who
informed
the
count
that
the
horses
were

were
both

the
superintendent

reporting
that
he
had
executed
the
instructions
he
had
informed
the
count
that
an
immense
crowd
had
collected
in
the
courtyard
and
wished
to
see
without
saying
a
word
rostopchin
rose
and
walked
hastily
to
his
luxurious
drawing
went
to
the
balcony
took
hold
of
the
let
it
go
and
went
to
the
window
from
which
he
had
a
better
view
of

was
standing
in
flourishing
his

and
saying
something

beside

was
audible

the
rostopchin
went
again
to
the
balcony
what

asked
the

to
your

have

what
they
have
done
with

full
of
an
irrepressible
fury
that
welled
up
within
him
against
the
someone
to
whom
what
was
happening
might
be
as
often
happens
with
passionate
he
was
mastered
by
anger
but

still

looked
at

desired

asked

as

by
an
unexpected
and
rapidly
opening
the

went
resolutely
out
onto

and
caps
were

all
eyes
were
raised
to

the
count
stepped
as
briskly
back
into
the
room
and
slammed
the

behind
a
murmur
of
approbation
and
satisfaction
ran
through

were

later
an

came
hurriedly
out

the
dragoons
formed
up
in
the
crowd
moved
eagerly
from
the
balcony
toward
the
coming
out
there
with
quick
angry
looked
hastily
around
as
if
seeking
is
he
and
as
he
spoke
he
saw
a
young
man
coming
round

raised

slowly
and
looked
up
at
him
as
if
wishing
to
say
something
or
at

to
meet
his
but
rostopchin
did
not
look
at
a
vein
in
the
young
long
thin
neck
swelled
like
a
cord
and
went
blue
behind
the

suddenly
his

all

were
fixed
on

looked
at
the
and
rendered
more
hopeful
by
the
expression
he
read
on

smiled
sadly

and
lowering

rostopchin
in
a
even
but
suddenly
he
glanced
down
at
vereshchagin
who
continued
to
stand
in
the
same
submissive
as
if
inflamed
by
the
he
raised
his
arm
and
addressed
the
almost
with
him
as
you
think
i
hand
him
over
to
the
crowd
remained
silent
and
only
pressed
closer
and
closer
to
one
to
keep
one
another
to
breathe
in
that
stifling
to
be
unable
to
and
to
await
something
and
was
becoming
those
standing
in
who
had
seen
and
heard
what
had
taken
place
before
all
stood
with
eyes
and
straining
with
all
their
and
held
back
the
crowd
that
was
pushing
behind
let
the
traitor
perish
and
not
disgrace
the
russian
shouted
him
i
command
hearing
not
so
much
the
words
as
the
angry
tone
of
the
crowd
moaned
and
heaved
but
again
exclaimed
the
timid
yet
theatrical
voice
of
vereshchagin
in
the
midst
of
the
momentary
silence
that
one
god
is
above
us
he
lifted
his
head
and
again
the
thick
vein
in
his
thin
neck
filled
with
blood
and
the
color
rapidly
came
and
went
in
his
he
did
not
finish
what
he
wished
to
him
i

shouted
suddenly
growing
pale
like
cried
the
dragoon
drawing
his
another
still
stronger
wave
flowed
through
the
crowd
and
reaching
the
front
ranks
carried
it
swaying
to
the
very
steps
of
the
the
tall
with
a
stony
look
on
his
and
rigid
and
uplifted
stood
beside
the
dragoon

almost
and
one
of
the
his
face
all
at
once
distorted
with
struck
vereshchagin
on
the
head
with
the
blunt
side
of
his
cried
vereshchagin
in
meek
looking
round
with
a
frightened
glance
as
if
not
understanding
why
this
was
done
to
a
similar
moan
of
surprise
and
horror
ran
through
the
exclaimed
a
sorrowful
but
after
the
exclamation
of
surprise
that
had
escaped
from
vereshchagin
he
uttered
a
plaintive
cry
of
and
that
cry
was
the
barrier
of
human
strained
to
the
that
had
held
the
crowd
in
check
suddenly
the
crime
had
begun
and
must
now
be
the
plaintive
moan
of
reproach
was
drowned
by
the
threatening
and
angry
roar
of
the
like
the
seventh
and
last
wave
that
shatters
a
that
last
irresistible
wave
burst
from
the
rear
and
reached
the
front
carrying
them
off
their
feet
and
engulfing
them
the
dragoon
was
about
to
repeat
his
vereshchagin
with
a
cry
of
covering
his
head
with
his

toward
the
the
tall
against
whom
he
seized
his
thin
neck
with
his
hands
yelling
fell
with
him
under
the
feet
of
the
struggling
some
beat
and
tore
at

tall
and
the
screams
of
those
that
were
being
trampled
on
and
of
those
who
tried
to
rescue
the
tall
lad
only
increased
the
fury
of
the
it
was
a
long
time
before
the
dragoons
could
extricate
the
bleeding
beaten
almost
to

for
a
long
despite
the
feverish
haste
with
which
the
mob
tried
to
end
the
work
that
had
been
those
who
were
and
tearing
at

were
unable

the
crowd
pressed
from

as
one
mass
with

in

the
victim
ceased

changed
to
a
measured
death
rattle
did
the
crowd
around
his
bleeding
corpse
begin
rapidly
to
change
each
one

glanced
at
what
had
been

with
and
astonishment
pushed
back
the

the

mob
looking
with
pained
distress
at
the
dead
body
with
its
neck
and
its
livid
face
stained
with
blood
and
a
painstaking

considering
the
presence
of
a
corpse
in
his
courtyard
told
the
dragoons
to
take

two
dragoons
took
it
by
its
distorted
legs
and
dragged
it
along
the
the
head
with
its
long
neck
trailed
twisting
along
the
the
crowd
shrank
back
from
at
the
moment
when
vereshchagin
fell
and
the
crowd
closed
in
with
savage
yells
and
swayed
about
rostopchin
suddenly
turned
pale
instead
of
going
to
the
back
entrance
where
his
carriage
awaited
went
with
hurried
steps
and
bent
not
knowing
where
and
along
the
passage
leading
to
the
rooms
on
the
ground
the
face
was
white
and
he
could
not
control
the
feverish
twitching
of
his
lower
your
where
are
you
this
said
a
frightened
voice
behind
count
rostopchin
was
unable
to
reply
turning
went
in
the
direction
at
the
back
entrance
stood
his
the
distant
roar
of
the
yelling
crowd
was
audible
even
he
hastily
took
his
seat
and
told
the
coachman
to
drive
him
to
his
country
house
in
when
they
reached
the
myasnitski
street
and
could
no
longer
hear
the
shouts
of
the
the
count
began
to
he
remembered
with
dissatisfaction
the
agitation
and
fear
he
had
betrayed
before
his
mob
is
he
said
to
himself
in
are
like
wolves
whom
nothing
but
flesh
can
one
god
is
above
us
words
suddenly
recurred
to
and
a
disagreeable
shiver
ran
down
his
but
this
was
only
a
momentary
feeling
and
count
rostopchin
smiled
disdainfully
at
had
other
thought
people
had
to
be
many
other
victims
have
perished
and
are
perishing
for
the
public
he
began
thinking
of
his
social
duties
to
his
family
and
to
the
city
entrusted
to
and
of
himself
as
theodore
vasilyevich
rostopchin
fancied
that
theodore
vasilyevich
rostopchin
was
sacrificing
himself
for
the
public
but
himself
as
the
representative
of
authority
and
of
the
i
been
simply
theodore
vasilyevich
my
course
of
action
would
have
been
quite
but
it
was
my
duty
to
safeguard
my
life
and
dignity
as
lightly
swaying
on
the
flexible
springs
of
his
carriage
and
no
longer
hearing
the
terrible
sounds
of
the
rostopchin
grew
physically
calm
as
always
as
soon
as
he
became
physically
tranquil
his
mind
devised
reasons
why
he
should
be
mentally
tranquil
the
thought
which
tranquillized
rostopchin
was
not
a
new
since
the
world
began
and
men
have
killed
one
another
no
one
has
ever
committed
such
a
crime
against
his
fellow
man
without
comforting
himself
with
this
same
this
idea
is
le
bien
the
hypothetical
welfare
of
other
to
a
man
not
swayed
by
passion
that
welfare
is
never
but
he
who
commits
such
a
crime
always
knows
just
where
that
welfare
and
rostopchin
now
knew
not
only
did
his
reason
not
reproach
him
for
what
he
had
but
he
even
found
cause
for
in
having
so
successfully
contrived
to
avail
himself
of
a
convenient
opportunity
to
punish
a
criminal
and
at
the
same
time
pacify
the
was
tried
and
condemned
to
thought
rostopchin
the
senate
had
only
condemned
vereshchagin
to
hard
was
a
traitor
and
a
i
could
not
let
him
go
unpunished
and
so
i
have
killed
two
birds
with
one
to
appease
the
mob
i
gave
them
a
victim
and
at
the
same
time
punished
a
having
reached
his
country
house
and
begun
to
give
orders
about
domestic
the
count
grew
quite
half
an
hour
later
he
was
driving
with
his
fast
horses
across
the
sokolniki
no
longer
thinking
of
what
had
occurred
but
considering
what
was
to
he
was
driving
to
the
yauza
bridge
where
he
had
heard
that
kutuzov
count
rostopchin
was
mentally
preparing
the
angry
and
stinging
reproaches
he
meant
to
address
to
kutuzov
for
his
he
would
make
that
foxy
old
courtier
feel
that
the
responsibility
for
all
the
calamities
that
would
follow
the
abandonment
of
the
city
and
the
ruin
of
russia
rostopchin
regarded
would
fall
upon
his
doting
old
planning
beforehand
what
he
would
say
to
rostopchin
turned
angrily
in
his
caleche
and
gazed
sternly
from
side
to
the
sokolniki
field
was
only
at
the
end
of
in
front
of
the
almshouse
and
the
lunatic
could
be
seen
some
people
in
white
and
others
like
them
walking
singly
across
the
field
shouting
and
one
of
these
was
running
to
cross
the
path
of
count
and
the
count
his
and
his
dragoons
looked
with
vague
horror
and
curiosity
at
these
released
lunatics
and
especially
at
the
one
running
toward
swaying
from
side
to
side
on
his
thin
legs
in
his
fluttering
dressing
this
lunatic
was
running
his
gaze
fixed
on
shouting
something
in
a
hoarse
voice
and
making
signs
to
him
to
the
gloomy
face
was
thin
and
with
its
beard
growing
in
uneven
his
agate
pupils
with
yellow
whites
moved
restlessly
near
the
lower
pull
i
tell
he
cried
in
a
piercing
and
again
shouted
something
breathlessly
with
emphatic
intonations
and
coming
abreast
of
the
caleche
he
ran
beside

they
slain
thrice

i
risen
from

and
thrice
he
raising
his
voice
higher
and
count
rostopchin
suddenly
grew
pale
as
he
had
done
when
the
crowd
closed
in
on
he
turned
he
cried
in
a
trembling
voice
to
his
the
caleche
flew
over
the
ground
as
fast
as
the
horses
could
draw
but
for
a
long
time
count
rostopchin
still
heard
the
insane
despairing
screams
growing
fainter
in
the
while
his
eyes
saw
nothing
but
the
bloodstained
face
of
in
the
recent
as
that
mental
picture
rostopchin
already
felt
that
it
had
cut
deep
into
his
heart
and
drawn
even
now
he
felt
clearly
that
the
gory
trace
of
that
recollection
would
not
pass
with
but
that
the
terrible
memory
on
the
dwell
in
his
heart
ever
more
cruelly
and
painfully
to
the
end
of
his
he
seemed
still
to
hear
the
sound
of
his
own
him
i
command
did
i
utter
those
it
was
by
some
accident
i
said
i
need
not
have
said
he
then
nothing
would
have
he
saw
the
frightened
and
then
infuriated
face
of
the
dragoon
who
dealt
the
the
look
of
timid
reproach
that
boy
in
the
coat
had
turned
upon
i
did
not
do
it
for
my
own
i
was
bound
to
act
that
the
the
the
public
thought
troops
were
still
crowding
at
the
yauza
it
was
dejected
and
sat
on
a
bench
by
the
bridge
toying
with
his
whip
in
the
sand
when
a
caleche
dashed
up
a
man
in
a
uniform
with
plumes
in
his
hat
went
up
to
kutuzov
and
said
something
in
it
was
count
he
told
kutuzov
that
he
had
come
because
the
was
no
more
and
only
the
army
would
have
been
different
if
your
serene
highness
had
not
told
me
that
you
would
not
abandon
moscow
without
another
all
this
would
not
have
he
kutuzov
looked
at
rostopchin
as
not
grasping
what
was
said
to
he
was
trying
to
read
something
peculiar
written
at
that
moment
on
the
face
of
the
man
addressing
rostopchin
grew
confused
and
became
kutuzov
slightly
shook
his
head
and
not
taking
his
penetrating
gaze
from
face
muttered
i
shall
not
give
up
moscow
without
a
whether
kutuzov
was
thinking
of
something
entirely
different
when
he
spoke
those
or
uttered
them
knowing
them
to
be
at
any
rate
rostopchin
made
no
reply
and
hastily
left
and
strange
to
the
governor
of
the
proud
count
took
up
a
cossack
whip
and
went
to
the
bridge
where
he
began
with
shouts
to

of
those
who

all
stared
in
timid
bewilderment
at
the

up
in

and
that
their

an
interpreter
rode
up
to
the

went
from

addressed
an
old
porter
and
asked
if

was
far
to
the
the
listening
in
perplexity
to
the
unfamiliar
polish
accent
and
not
realizing
that
the

was
speaking
did
not
understand
what
was
being
said
to

and
slipped
behind

the

and
told
him
to
ask
where
the
russian
army
one
of

understood
what
was
asked
and
several
voices
at
once
began
answering

reported
that

halted
and
drew
in

the
placing
of

and
looked
at
the
kremlin
through

the
bells
in
the
kremlin
were
ringing
for
and
this
sound
troubled
the
they
imagined
it
to
be
a
call
to
a
few
infantrymen
ran
to
the
kutafyev
beams
and
wooden

been
put

two
musket
shots
rang
out
from
under

as
soon
as
an
officer
and
men
began
to
run
toward

was
standing
by

from

came
the
strange
sound
of

at
a
word
of

the
expression
of
cheerful
serenity
on
the
faces
of
the
french
and
men
changed
to
one
of
determined
concentrated
readiness
for
strife
and
to
all
of
them
from
the
marshal
to
the
least
that
place
was
not
the
or
kutafyev
nor
the
troitsa
gate
familiar
in
but
a
new
battlefield
which
would
probably
prove
and
all
made
ready
for
that
the
cries
from
the
gates
the
guns
were
the
artillerymen
blew
the
ash
off
their
and
an
officer
gave
the
word
this
was
followed
by
two
whistling
sounds
of
canister
one
after
the
shot
rattled
against
the
stone
of
the
gate
and
upon
the
wooden
beams
and
and
two
wavering
clouds
of
smoke
rose
over
the
a
few
instants
after
the
echo
of
the
reports
resounding
over
the
built
kremlin
had
died
away
the
french
heard
a
strange
sound
above
their
thousands
of
crows
rose
above
the
walls
and
circled
in
the
cawing
and
noisily
flapping
their
together
with
that
sound
came
a
solitary
human
cry
from
the
gateway
and
amid
the
smoke
appeared
the
figure
of
a
bareheaded
man
in
a
he
grasped
a
musket
and
took
aim
at
the
repeated
the
officer
once
and
the
reports
of
a
musket
and
of
two
cannon
shots
were
heard
the
gate
was
again
hidden
by
nothing
more
stirred
behind
the
screens
and
the
french
infantry
soldiers
and
officers
advanced
to
the
in
the
gateway
lay
three
wounded
and
four
two
men
in
peasant
coats
ran
away
at
the
foot
of
the
toward
the
that
said

to

the
french
after
dispatching
the

the
corpses
over
the
who
these
men
were
nobody
that
was
all
that
was
said
of
and
they
were
thrown
over
the
parapet
and
removed
later

themselves
with

some
of

and
the

purged
of
their

informed
that
the
way

been

french

the
gates
and
began
pitching
their
camp
in
the
senate
out
of
the
windows
of
the
senate
house
the
soldiers
threw
chairs
into
the
square
for

kindled

other
detachments

through
the

encamped
along

themselves
along

no
masters
of

the

were
not
billeted
on
the
inhabitants
as
is
usual
in
towns
but
lived
in
it
as
in
a
though
worn
and
reduced
to
a
third
of
their
original
the
french
entered
moscow
in
good
marching
it
was
a
weary
and
but
still
a
fighting
and
menacing
but
it
remained
an
army
only
until
its
soldiers
had
dispersed
into
their
different
as
soon
as
the
men
of
the
various
regiments
began
to
disperse
among
the
wealthy
and
deserted
the
army
was
lost
forever
and
there
came
into
being
something
neither
citizens
nor
soldiers
but
what
are
known
as
when
five
weeks
later
these
same
men
left
they
no
longer
formed
an
they
were
a
mob
of
each
carrying
a
quantity
of
articles
which
seemed
to
him
valuable
or
the
aim
of
each
man
when
he
left
moscow
was
no
as
it
had
to
but
merely
to
keep
what
he
had
like
a
monkey
which
puts
its
paw
into
the
narrow
neck
of
a
and
having
seized
a
handful
of
nuts
will
not
open
its
fist
for
fear
of
losing
what
it
and
therefore
the
french
when
they
left
moscow
had
inevitably
to
perish
because
they
carried
their
loot
with
yet
to
abandon
what
they
had
stolen
was
as
impossible
for
them
as
it
is
for
the
monkey
to
open
its
paw
and
let
go
of
its
ten
minutes
after
each
regiment
had
entered
a
moscow
not
a
soldier
or
officer
was
men
in
military
uniforms
and
hessian
boots
could
be
seen
through
the
laughing
and
walking
through
the
in
cellars
and
storerooms
similar
men
were
busy
among
the

in
the
yards
unlocking
or
breaking
open
coach
house
and
stable
lighting
fires
in
kitchens
and
kneading
and
baking
bread
with
and
or
or
caressing
women
and
there
were
many
such
men
both
in
the
shops
and
there
was
no
order
after
order
was
issued
by
the
french
commanders
that
day
forbidding
the
men
to
disperse
about
the
sternly
forbidding
any
violence
to
the
inhabitants
or
any
and
announcing
a
roll
call
for
that
very
but
despite
all
these
measures
the
who
had
till
then
constituted
an

all
over
the
deserted
city
with
its
comforts
and
plentiful

a
hungry
herd
of
cattle

well
together
when
crossing
a
barren
but
gets
out
of

and
at
once
disperses
uncontrollably
as
soon
as
it
reaches
rich
so
did
the
army
disperse
all
over
the
wealthy
no

were
left
in
and
the

percolating
through
irresistibly
through
the
city
in
all
directions
from
the
kremlin
into
which
they
had
first

entering

that
had
been
abandoned

there

the
next

many
of

appropriated

on

quarreled
and
even
fought
with
other
companies
for

they
had
had
time
to

the
soldiers
ran
out
into
the
streets
to

that
everything

to
places
where

were

when

both

in
the
same
way
the

of

famished
army
into

and
deserted
city
resulted
in
fires
and
looting
and
the
destruction
of
both
the

the
french
attributed
the
fire
of

au

russians
to
the
barbarity
of

in

not
possible
to
explain
the
burning
of
moscow
by
making
any
or
any
group
of

moscow
was
burned
because
it
found
itself
in
a
position
in
which
any
town
built
of
wood
was
bound
to

apart
from
whether
it

deserted
moscow
had
to
burn
as
inevitably
as
a
heap
of

has
to

on
which
sparks
continually
fall
for
several
a
town
built
of
where
scarcely
a
day
passes
without
conflagrations
when
the

owners
are
in
residence
and
a

very
for
no

be

have
happened
without

however
tempting
it
might

on
to

impossible
not

see
that
there
could

no
such
direct

every
or

moscow
was
burned
by
its
it

but
by
those
who
had
abandoned
it
and
not
by
those
who
remained
in
moscow
when
occupied
by
the
enemy
did
not
remain
intact
like
and
other
simply
because
its
inhabitants
abandoned
it
and
did
not
welcome
the
french
with
bread
and
nor
bring
them
the
keys
of
the
chapter
xxvii
the
absorption
of
the
french
by
radiating
starwise
as
it
only
reached
the
quarter
where
pierre
was
staying
by
the
evening
of
the
second
of
after
the
last
two
days
spent
in
solitude
and
unusual
pierre
was
in
a
state
bordering
on
he
was
completely
obsessed
by
one
persistent
he
did
not
know
how
or
when
this
thought
had
taken
such
possession
of
but
he
remembered
nothing
of
the
understood
nothing
of
the
and
all
he
saw
and
heard
appeared
to
him
like
a
he
had
left
home
only
to
escape
the
intricate
tangle
of
demands
that
enmeshed
and
which
in
his
present
condition
he
was
unable
to
he
had
gone
to
joseph
on
the
plea
of
sorting
the
books
and
only
in
search
of
rest
from
for
in
his
mind
the
memory
of
joseph
alexeevich
was
connected
with
a
world
of
and
calm
quite
contrary
to
the
restless
confusion
into
which
he
felt
himself
being
he
sought
a
quiet
and
in
joseph
study
he
really
found
when
he
sat
with
his
elbows
on
the
dusty
writing
table
in
the
deathlike
stillness
of
the
calm
and
significant
memories
of
the
last
few
days
rose
one
after
another
in
his
particularly
of
the
battle
of
borodino
and
of
that
vague
sense
of
his
own
insignificance
and
insincerity
compared
with
the
and
strength
of
the
class
of
men
he
mentally
classed
as
when
gerasim
roused
him
from
his
reverie
the
idea
occurred
to
him
of
taking
part
in
the
popular
defense
of
moscow
which
he
knew
was
and
with
that
object
he
had
asked
gerasim
to
get
him
a
coat
and
a
confiding
to
him
his
intentions
of
remaining
in
joseph
house
and
keeping
his
name
then
during
the
first
day
spent
in
inaction
and
solitude
tried
several
times
to
fix
his
attention
on
the
masonic
but
was
unable
to
do
the
idea
that
had
previously
occurred
to
him
of
the
cabalistic
significance
of
his
name
in
connection
with
more
than
once
vaguely
presented
but
the
idea
that
was
destined
to
set
a
limit
to
the
power
of
the
beast
was
as
yet
only
one
of
the
fancies
that
often
passed
through
his
mind
and
left
no
trace
having
bought
the
coat
merely
with
the
object
of
taking
part
among
the
people
in
the
defense
of
pierre
had
met
the
rostovs
and
natasha
had
said
to
you
remaining
in
how
the
thought
flashed
into
his
mind
that
it
really
would
be
a
good
even
if
moscow
were
for
him
to
remain
there
and
do
what
he
was
predestined
to
next
with
the
sole
idea
of
not
sparing
himself
and
not
lagging
in
any
way
behind
pierre
went
to
the
three
hills
but
when
he
returned
to
the
house
convinced
that
moscow
would
not
be
he
suddenly
felt
that
what
before
had
seemed
to
him
merely
a
possibility
had
now
become
absolutely
necessary
and
he
must
remain
in
concealing
his
and
must
meet
napoleon
and
kill
and
either
perish
or
put
an
end
to
the
misery
of
all
it
seemed
to
him
was
solely
due
to
pierre
knew
all
the
details
of
the
attempt
on
life
in
1809
by
a
german
student
in
and
knew
that
the
student
had
been
and
the
risk
to
which
he
would
expose
his
life
by
carrying
out
his
design
excited
him
still
two
equally
strong
feelings
drew
pierre
irresistibly
to
this
the
first
was
a
feeling
of
the
necessity
of
sacrifice
and
suffering
in
view
of
the
common
the
same
feeling
that
had
caused
him
to
go
to
mozhaysk
on
the
and
to
make
his
way
to
the
very
thick
of
the
battle
and
had
now
caused
him
to
run
away
from
his
home
in
place
of
the
luxury
and
comfort
to
which
he
was
to
sleep
on
a
hard
sofa
without
undressing
and
eat
the
same
food
as
the
other
was
that
vague
and
quite
russian
feeling
of
contempt
for
everything
and
everything
the
majority
of
men
regard
as
the
greatest
good
in
the
pierre
had
first
experienced
this
strange
and
fascinating
feeling
at
the
sloboda
when
he
had
suddenly
felt
that
and
that
men
so
painstakingly
acquire
and
it
has
any
worth
has
so
only
by
reason
of
the
joy
with
which
it
can
all
be
it
was
the
feeling
that
induces
a
volunteer
recruit
to
spend
his
last
penny
on
and
a
drunken
man
to
smash
mirrors
or
glasses
for
no
apparent
reason
and
knowing
that
it
will
cost
him
all
the
money
he
the
feeling
which
causes
a
man
to
perform
actions
which
from
an
ordinary
point
of
view
are
to
as
it
his
personal
power
and
affirming
the
existence
of
a
nonhuman
criterion
of
from
the
very
day
pierre
had
experienced
this
feeling
for
the
first
time
at
the
sloboda
palace
he
had
been
continuously
under
its
but
only
now
found
full
satisfaction
for
at
this
moment
pierre
was
supported
in
his
design
and
prevented
from
renouncing
it
by
what
he
had
already
done
in
that
if
he
were
now
to
leave
moscow
like
everyone
his
flight
from
the
peasant
the
and
his
announcement
to
the
rostovs
that
he
would
remain
in
moscow
would
all
become
not
merely
meaningless
but
contemptible
and
and
to
this
pierre
was
very
physical
as
is
always
the
corresponded
to
his
mental
the
unaccustomed
coarse
the
vodka
he
drank
during
those
the
absence
of
wine
and
his
dirty
unchanged
two
almost
sleepless
nights
passed
on
a
short
sofa
without
this
kept
him
in
a
state
of
excitement
bordering
on
it
was
two
in
the
the
french
had
already
entered
pierre
knew
but
instead
of
acting
he
only
thought
about
his
going
over
its
minutest
details
in
his
in
his
fancy
he
did
not
clearly
picture
to
himself
either
the
striking
of
the
blow
or
the
death
of
but
with
extraordinary
vividness
and
melancholy
enjoyment
imagined
his
own
destruction
and
heroic
for
the
sake
of
i
must
do
it
or
he
i
will
and
then
with
pistol
or
but
that
is
all
the
is
not
i
but
the
hand
of
providence
that
punishes
i
shall
thought
imagining
what
he
would
say
when
killing
take
me
and
execute
he
went
speaking
to
himself
and
bowing
his
head
with
a
sad
but
firm
while
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
was
talking
to
himself
in
this
the
study
door
opened
and
on
the
threshold
appeared
the
figure
of
makar
always
so
timid
before
but
now
quite
his
dressing
gown
was
his
face
red
and
he
was
obviously
on
seeing
pierre
he
grew
confused
at
but
noticing
embarrassment
on
face
immediately
grew
bold
staggering
on
his
thin
advanced
into
the
middle
of
the
he
said
confidentially
in
a
hoarse
say
i
i
am
i
not
he
paused
and
then
suddenly
seeing
the
pistol
on
the
table
seized
it
with
unexpected
rapidity
and
ran
out
into
the
gerasim
and
the
who
had
followed
makar
stopped
him
in
the
vestibule
and
tried
to
take
the
pistol
from
coming
out
into
the
looked
with
pity
and
repulsion
at
the
old
makar
frowning
with
held
on
to
the
pistol
and
screamed
evidently
with
some
heroic
fancy
in
his
board
you
get
he
will
that
will
have
the
to
let
pleaded
trying
carefully
to
steer
makar
alexeevich
by
the
elbows
back
to
the
are
shouted
makar
not
come
to
your
and
allow
me
to

at

around
and

the
officer
turned
to
gerasim
and
asked
him
to
show
him
the
rooms
in
the
not
said
trying
to
render
his
words
more
comprehensible
by
contorting
still
the
french
officer
spread
out
his
hands
before
intimating
that
he
did
not
understand
him
and
to
the
door
at
which
pierre

to
go
away
and
conceal
but
at
that
moment
he
saw

at
the

moment
pierre
threw
himself
on
the
just
when
pierre
snatched
at
and
struck
up
the
pistol
makar
alexeevich
at
last
got
his
fingers
on

was
a
deafening
and
all
were
enveloped
in
a
cloud
of
the
frenchman
turned
pale
and
rushed
to
the
forgetting
his
intention
of
concealing
his
knowledge
of
snatching
away
the
pistol
and
throwing
it
ran
up
to
the
officer
and
addressed
him
in

the
feeling
himself

a
lucky
escape

he
pointing
to
the
damaged
plaster
of
the

that
said
looking
sternly
at
i
am
really
in
despair
at
what
has
said
pierre
quite
forgetting
the
part
he
had
intended
to
is
an
unfortunate
madman
who
did
not
know
what
he
was
the

went
up
to

and
took
him
by

standing
with

for

the
letting
go
of

merciful
after
but
we
do
not
pardon
he
with
a
look
of
gloomy
dignity
and
a
fine
energetic
pierre
in
to
persuade
the
officer
not
to
hold
that
drunken
imbecile
to
the
frenchman
listened
in
silence
with
the
same
gloomy
but
suddenly
turned
to
pierre
with
a
for
a
few
seconds
he
looked
at
him
in
his
handsome
face
assumed
a
melodramatically
gentle
expression
and
he
held
out
his
have
saved
my
you
are
said
for
a
frenchman
that
deduction
was
only
a
frenchman
could
perform
a
great
and
to
save
his
life
of
captain
of
the
13th
light
undoubtedly
a
very
great
but
however
indubitable
that
conclusion
and
the
conviction
based
upon
pierre
felt
it
necessary
to
disillusion
am
he
said
tell
that
to
said
the
waving
his
finger
before
his
nose
and
shall
tell
me
all
about
that
i
am
delighted
to
meet
a
and
what
are
we
to
do
with
this
he
addressing
himself
to
pierre
as
to
a
even
if
pierre
were
not
a
having
once
received
that
loftiest
of
human
appellations
he
could
not
renounce
said
the
look
and
in
reply
to
his
last
question
pierre
again
explained
who
makar
alexeevich
was
and
how
just
before
their
arrival
that
drunken
imbecile
had
seized
the
loaded
pistol
which
they
had
not
had
time
to
recover
from
and
begged
the
officer
to
let
the
deed
go
the
frenchman
expanded
his
chest
and
made
a
majestic
gesture
with
his
have
saved
my
you
are
you
ask
his
i
grant
it
lead
that
man
said
he
quickly
and
and
taking
the
arm
of
pierre
whom
he
had
promoted
to
be
a
frenchman
for
saving
his
he
went
with
him
into
the
the
soldiers
in
the
hearing
the
came
into
the
passage
asking
what
had
and
expressed
their
readiness
to
punish
the
but
the
officer
sternly
checked
will
be
called
in
when
you
are
he
the
soldiers
went
out
and
the
who
had
meanwhile
had
time
to
visit
the
came
up
to
his
there
is
soup
and
a
leg
of
mutton
in
the
said
i
serve
them
and
some
answered
the
chapter
xxix
when
the
french
officer
went
into
the
room
with
pierre
the
latter
again
thought
it
his
duty
to
assure
him
that
he
was
not
french
and
wished
to
go
but
the
officer
would
not
hear
of
he
was
so
very
and
genuinely
grateful
to
pierre
for
saving
his
life
that
pierre
had
not
the
heart
to
and
sat
down
with
him
in
the
first
room
they
to
assurances
that
he
was
not
a
the
evidently
not
understanding
how
anyone
could
decline
so
flattering
an
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
that
if
pierre
absolutely
insisted
on
passing
for
a
russian
let
it
be
but
for
all
that
he
would
be
forever
bound
to
pierre
by
gratitude
for
saving
his
had
this
man
been
endowed
with
the
slightest
capacity
for
perceiving
the
feelings
of
and
had
he
at
all
understood
what
feelings
the
latter
would
probably
have
left
but
the
animated
obtuseness
to
everything
other
than
himself
disarmed
frenchman
or
a
russian
prince
said
the
looking
at
fine
though
dirty
linen
and
at
the
ring
on
his
owe
my
life
to
you
and
offer
you
my
a
frenchman
never
forgets
either
an
insult
or
a
i
offer
you
my
that
is
all
i
can
there
was
so
much
good
nature
and
nobility
the
french
sense
of
the
in
the
in
the
expression
of
his
face
and
in
his
that
unconsciously
smiling
in
response
to
the
pressed
the
hand
held
out
to
of
the
13th
light
chevalier
of
the
legion
of
honor
for
the
affair
on
the
seventh
of
he
introduced
a
irrepressible
smile
puckering
his
lips
under
his
you
now
be
so
good
as
to
tell
me
with
whom
i
have
the
honor
of
conversing
so
instead
of
being
in
the
ambulance
with
that
bullet
in
my
pierre
replied
that
he
could
not
tell
him
his
name
began
to
try
to
invent
a
name
and
to
say
something
about
his
reason
for
concealing
but
the
frenchman
hastily
interrupted
said
understand
your
you
are
an
a
superior
officer
you
have
borne
arms
against
not
my
i
owe
you
my
that
is
enough
for
i
am
quite
at
your
you
belong
to
the
he
concluded
with
a
shade
of
inquiry
in
his
pierre
bent
his
baptismal
if
you
that
is
all
i
monsieur
you
all
i
want
to
when
the
mutton
and
an
omelet
had
been
served
and
a
samovar
and
vodka
with
some
wine
which
the
french
had
taken
from
a
russian
cellar
and
brought
with
ramballe
invited
pierre
to
share
his
and
himself
began
to
eat
greedily
and
quickly
like
a
healthy
and
hungry
munching
his
food
rapidly
with
his
strong
continually
smacking
his
and
his
face
grew
red
and
was
covered
with
pierre
was
hungry
and
shared
the
dinner
with
the
brought
some
hot
water
in
a
saucepan
and
placed
a
bottle
of
claret
in
he
also
brought
a
bottle
of
taken
from
the
kitchen
for
them
to
that
beverage
was
already
known
to
the
french
and
had
been
given
a
special
they
called
it
limonade
de
cochon
and
morel
spoke
well
of
the
limonade
de
cochon
he
had
found
in
the
but
as
the
captain
had
the
wine
they
had
taken
while
passing
through
he
left
the
kvass
to
morel
and
applied
himself
to
the
bottle
of
he
wrapped
the
bottle
up
to
its
neck
in
a
table
napkin
and
poured
out
wine
for
himself
and
for
the
satisfaction
of
his
hunger
and
the
wine
rendered
the
captain
still
more
lively
and
he
chatted
incessantly
all
through
my
dear
monsieur
i
owe
you
a
fine
votive
candle
for
saving
me
from
that
you
i
have
bullets
enough
in
my
body
here
is
one
i
got
at

his
a
second
at
showed
a
scar
on
his
this
leg
which
as
you
see
does
not
want
to
i
got
that
on
the
seventh
at
the
great
battle
of
la
sacre
it
was
that
deluge
of
fire
was
worth
it
was
a
tough
job
you
set
us
my
you
may
be
proud
of
and
on
my
in
spite
of
the
cough
i
caught
i
should
be
ready
to
begin
i
pity
those
who
did
not
see
was
said
so
much
the
you
are
certainly
brave
the
great
redoubt
held
out
by
my
continued
the
you
made
us
pay
dear
for
i
was
at
it
three
as
i
sit
three
times
we
reached
the
guns
and
three
times
we
were
thrown
back
like
cardboard
it
was
monsieur
your
grenadiers
were
by
i
saw
them
close
up
their
ranks
six
times
in
succession
and
march
as
if
on
fine
our
king
of
who
knows
cried
so
you
are
one
of
us
he
after
a
momentary
much
the
so
much
the
monsieur
terrible
in
with
the
winked
and
what
the
french
monsieur
the
captain
was
so
naively
and
so
and
so
pleased
with
himself
that
pierre
almost
winked
back
as
he
looked
merrily
at
probably
the
word
turned
the
thoughts
to
the
state
of
tell
me
is
it
true
that
the
women
have
all
left
what
a
queer
what
had
they
to
be
afraid
not
the
french
ladies
leave
paris
if
the
russians
entered
asked
the
frenchman
emitted
a
sanguine
patting
pierre
on
the
a
thing
to
he
but
capital
of
the
pierre
finished
his
remark
for
the
captain
looked
at
he
had
a
habit
of
stopping
short
in
the
middle
of
his
talk
and
gazing
intently
with
his
kindly
if
you
told
me
you
were
i
should
have
wagered
that
you
were
you
have
i
know
and
having
uttered
this
he
again
gazed
at
him
in
have
been
in
i
spent
years
said
one
sees
that
a
man
who
know
paris
is
a
you
can
tell
a
parisian
two
leagues
paris
is
la
the
the
and
noticing
that
his
conclusion
was
weaker
than
what
had
gone
he
added
is
only
one
paris
in
the
you
have
been
to
paris
and
have
remained
i
esteem
you
the
less
for
under
the
influence
of
the
wine
he
had
and
after
the
days
he
had
spent
alone
with
his
depressing
pierre
involuntarily
enjoyed
talking
with
this
cheerful
and
return
to
your
hear
they
are
what
a
wretched
idea
to
go
and
bury
themselves
in
the
steppes
when
the
french
army
is
in
what
a
chance
those
girls
have
your
another
but
you
civilized
you
ought
to
know
us
better
than
we
took
all
the
we
are
but
we
are
we
are
nice
to
and
then
the
he
but
pierre
interrupted
pierre
and
his
face
suddenly
became
sad
and
the
he
is
what
the
emperor
it
is
who
tell
you
i
assure
you
i
was
his
enemy
eight
years
my
father
was
an
emigrant
but
that
man
has
vanquished
he
has
taken
hold
of
i
could
not
resist
the
sight
of
the
grandeur
and
glory
with
which
he
has
covered
when
i
understood
what
he
i
saw
that
he
was
preparing
a
bed
of
laurels
for
you
i
said
to
is
a
and
i
devoted
myself
to
so
oh
mon
he
is
the
greatest
man
of
the
ages
past
or
he
in
pierre
stammered
with
a
guilty
the
frenchman
looked
at
his
guilty
face
and
he
will
make
his
entry
he
and
continued
his
their
conversation
was
interrupted
by
the
cries
of
several
voices
at
the
gate
and
by
who
came
to
say
that
some
wurttemberg
hussars
had
come
and
wanted
to
put
up
their
horses
in
the
yard
where
the
horses
this
difficulty
had
arisen
chiefly
because
the
hussars
did
not
understand
what
was
said
to
them
in
the
captain
had
their
senior
sergeant
called
and
in
a
stern
voice
asked
him
to
what
regiment
he
who
was
his
commanding
and
by
what
right
he
allowed
himself
to
claim
quarters
that
were
already
the
german
who
knew
little
answered
the
two
first
questions
by
giving
the
names
of
his
regiment
and
of
his
commanding
but
in
reply
to
the
third
question
which
he
did
not
understand
introducing
broken
french
into
his
own
that
he
was
the
quartermaster
of
the
regiment
and
his
commander
had
ordered
him
to
occupy
all
the
houses
one
after
who
knew
translated
what
the
german
said
to
the
captain
and
gave
the
reply
to
the
wurttemberg
hussar
in
when
he
had
understood
what
was
said
to
the
german
submitted
and
took
his
men
the
captain
went
out
into
the
porch
and
gave
some
orders
in
a
loud
when
he
returned
to
the
room
pierre
was
sitting
in
the
same
place
as
with
his
head
in
his
his
face
expressed
he
really
was
suffering
at
that
when
the
captain
went
out
and
he
was
left
suddenly
he
came
to
himself
and
realized
the
position
he
was
it
was
not
that
moscow
had
been
taken
or
that
the
happy
conquerors
were
masters
in
it
and
were
patronizing
painful
as
that
was
it
was
not
that
which
tormented
pierre
at
the
he
was
tormented
by
the
consciousness
of
his
own
the
few
glasses
of
wine
he
had
drunk
and
the
conversation
with
this
man
had
destroyed
the
mood
of
concentrated
gloom
in
which
he
had
spent
the
last
few
days
and
which
was
essential
for
the
execution
of
his
the
and
peasant
coat
were
napoleon
was
to
enter
the
town
next
pierre
still
considered
that
it
would
be
a
useful
and
worthy
action
to
slay
the
but
now
he
felt
that
he
would
not
do
he
did
not
know
but
he
felt
a
foreboding
that
he
would
not
carry
out
his
he
struggled
against
the
confession
of
his
weakness
but
dimly
felt
that
he
could
not
overcome
it
and
that
his
former
gloomy
frame
of
concerning
and
had
been
dispersed
like
dust
by
contact
with
the
first
man
he
the
captain
returned
to
the
limping
slightly
and
whistling
a
the
chatter
which
had
previously
amused
pierre
now
repelled
the
tune
he
was
his
and
the
gesture
with
which
he
twirled
his
all
now
seemed
will
go
away
i
say
another
word
to
thought
he
thought
but
still
sat
in
the
same
a
strange
feeling
of
weakness
tied
him
to
the
he
wished
to
get
up
and
go
but
could
not
do
the
on
the
other
seemed
very
he
paced
up
and
down
the
room
his
eyes
shone
and
his
mustache
twitched
as
if
he
were
smiling
to
himself
at
some
amusing
colonel
of
those
wurttembergers
is
he
suddenly
a
but
a
nice
fellow
all
the
but
a
he
sat
down
facing
the
you
know
pierre
looked
at
him

one
of
the
most
ancient
in

with
a
easy
and
naive

pierre
again
emptied
his
glass
and
poured
himself
out
a
and
the
looking
with
glistening
eyes
at
began
talking
of
love
and
of
his
love
there
were
very
many
of
as
one
could
easily
looking
at
the
and
noting
the
eager
enthusiasm
with
which
he
spoke
of
though
all
love
stories
had
the
sensual
character
which
frenchmen
regard
as
the
special
charm
and
poetry
of
yet
he
told
his
story
with
such
sincere
conviction
that
he
alone
had
experienced
and
known
all
the
charm
of
love
and
he
described
women
so
alluringly
that
pierre
listened
to
him
with
it
was
plain
that
which
the
frenchman
was
so
fond
of
was
not
that
low
and
simple
kind
that
pierre
had
once
felt
for
his
nor
was
it
the
romantic
love
stimulated
by
himself
that
he
experienced
for
despised
both
these
kinds
of
love
the
one
he
considered
the
of
and
the
other
the
of
which
the
frenchman
worshiped
consisted
principally
in
the
unnaturalness
of
his
relation
to
the
woman
and
in
a
combination
of
incongruities
giving
the
chief
charm
to
the
thus
the
captain
touchingly
recounted
the
story
of
his
love
for
a
fascinating
marquise
of
and
at
the
same
time
for
a
innocent
child
of
daughter
of
the
bewitching
the
conflict
of
magnanimity
between
the
mother
and
the
ending
in
the
sacrificing
herself
and
offering
her
daughter
in
marriage
to
her
even
now
agitated
the
though
it
was
the
memory
of
a
distant
then
he
recounted
an
episode
in
which
the
husband
played
the
part
of
the
and
the
role
of
the
as
well
as
several
droll
incidents
from
his
recollections
of
where
is
called
unterkunft
and
where
the
husbands
eat
sauerkraut
and
the
young
girls
are
the
latest
episode
in
poland
still
fresh
in
the
and
which
he
narrated
with
rapid
gestures
and
glowing
was
of
how
he
had
saved
the
life
of
a
pole
the
saving
of
life
continually
occurred
in
the
and
the
pole
had
entrusted
to
him
his
enchanting
wife
de
while
himself
entering
the
french
the
captain
was
the
enchanting
polish
lady
wished
to
elope
with
prompted
by
the
captain
restored
the
wife
to
the
saying
as
he
did
have
saved
your
and
i
save
your
having
repeated
these
words
the
captain
wiped
his
eyes
and
gave
himself
a
as
if
driving
away
the
weakness
which
assailed
him
at
this
touching
listening
to
the
often
happens
late
in
the
evening
and
under
the
influence
of
all
that
was
told
understood
it
and
at
the
same
time
followed
a
train
of
personal
memories
he
knew
not
suddenly
arose
in
his
while
listening
to
these
love
stories
his
own
love
for
natasha
unexpectedly
rose
to
his
and
going
over
the
pictures
of
that
love
in
his
imagination
he
mentally
compared
them
with
listening
to
the
story
of
the
struggle
between
love
and
pierre
saw
before
his
eyes
every
minutest
detail
of
his
last
meeting
with
the
object
of
his
love
at
the
sukharev
water
at
the
time
of
that
meeting
it
had
not
produced
an
effect
upon
had
not
even
once
recalled
but
now
it
seemed
to
him
that
that
meeting
had
had
in
it
something
very
important
and
come
we
have
recognized
he
now
seemed
to
hear
the
words
she
had
uttered
and
to
see
before
him
her
her
her
traveling
and
a
stray
lock
of
her
and
there
seemed
to
him
something
pathetic
and
touching
in
all
having
finished
his
tale
about
the
enchanting
polish
the
captain
asked
pierre
if
he
had
ever
experienced
a
similar
impulse
to
sacrifice
himself
for
love
and
a
feeling
of
envy
of
the
legitimate
challenged
by
this
question
pierre
raised
his
head
and
felt
a
need
to
express
the
thoughts
that
filled
his
he
began
to
explain
that
he
understood
love
for
a
women
somewhat
he
said
that
in
all
his
life
he
had
loved
and
still
loved
only
one
and
that
she
could
never
be
said
the
pierre
then
explained
that
he
had
loved
this
woman
from
his
earliest
but
that
he
had
not
dared
to
think
of
her
because
she
was
too
and
because
he
had
been
an
illegitimate
son
without
a
afterwards
when
he
had
received
a
name
and
wealth
he
dared
not
think
of
her
because
he
loved
her
too
placing
her
far
above
everything
in
the
and
especially
therefore
above
when
he
had
reached
this
pierre
asked
the
captain
whether
he
understood
the
captain
made
a
gesture
signifying
that
even
if
he
did
not
understand
it
he
begged
pierre
to
he
whether
it
was
the
wine
he
had
or
an
impulse
of
or
the
thought
that
this
man
did
and
never
know
any
of
those
who
played
a
part
in
his
or
whether
it
was
all
these
things
something
loosened
speaking
thickly
and
with
a
faraway
look
in
his
shining
he
told
the
whole
story
of
his
his
love
for
his
best
her
betrayal
of
and
all
his
own
simple
relations
with
urged
on
by
questions
he
also
told
what
he
had
at
first
own
position
and
even
his
more
than
anything
else
in
story
the
captain
was
impressed
by
the
fact
that
pierre
was
very
had
two
mansions
in
and
that
he
had
abandoned
everything
and
not
left
the
but
remained
there
concealing
his
name
and
when
it
was
late
at
night
they
went
out
together
into
the

night
was
warm
and
to
the
left
of
the

up
in

opposite
to
it
hung
that
bright
comet

was
connected
in

and
their
mutually
incomprehensible

at

was
nothing
terrible

in
the
immense
gazing
at

at

and
at
the
glow
from
the

experienced
a
joyful
how
good
it
what
more
does
one
thought
and
suddenly
remembering
his
intention
he
grew
dizzy
and
felt
so
faint
that
he
leaned
against
the
fence
to
save
himself
from
without
taking
leave
of
his
new
pierre
left
the
gate
with
unsteady
steps
and
returning
to
his
room

down
on

blocked
by

so
many
things
had
been
forgotten

they
had
decided
to
spend

night
at
a
place
three
miles
out

woke
late

so
often

awful
pain

suffered

him
moan
incessantly
and
and
his
moaning
sounded
terrible
in
the
darkness
of
the
autumn
he
had
spent
the
first
night
in
the
same
yard
as
the
the
countess
said
she
had
been
unable
to
close
her
eyes
on

at

she
moved
into
a

simply
to
be
farther

he
gave

it
was
as
if

waited
for
this
to
realize

under

just
where
she
had
sat
down

paid
no

was
listening
to

ceaseless
moaning
of
the
three

from
the

said
to
her
evidently
wishing
to
distract
her
but
natasha
looked
at
her
as
if
not
understanding
what
was
said
to
her
and
again
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
corner
of
the
she
had
been
in
this
condition
of
stupor
since
the
when
to
the
surprise
and
annoyance
of
the
had
for
some
unaccountable
reason
found
it
necessary
to
tell
natasha
of
prince

and
of
his
being
with
their
the
countess
had
seldom
been
so
angry
with
anyone
as
she
was
with

had
cried
and
begged
to
be
forgiven

as
if
trying

atone
for

dreadfully
it

to
get

turned
her
face
to
the
looked
out
in
such
a
way
that
it
was
evident
that
she
could
not
see
and
again
settled
down
in
her
former
you
see
really
i
natasha
replied
in
a
voice
that
pleaded
to
be
left
in
both
the
countess
and
sonya
understood
neither
moscow
nor
the
burning
of
moscow
nor
anything
else
could
seem
of
importance
to
the
count
returned
and
lay
down
behind
the
the
countess
went
up
to
her
daughter
and
touched
her
head
with
the
back
of
her
hand
as
she
was
wont
to
do
when
natasha
was
then
touched
her
forehead
with
her
lips
as
if
to
feel
whether
she
was
and
finally
kissed
are
you
are
trembling
all
better
lie
said
the
all
i
lie
down
at

when
natasha
had
been
told
that
morning
that
prince
andrew
was
seriously
wounded
and
was
traveling
with
their
she
had
at
first
asked
many
where
was
he
how
was
he
was
it
and
could
she
see
but
after
she
had
been
told
that
she
could
not
see
that
he
was
seriously
wounded
but
that
his
life
was
not
in
she
ceased
to
ask
questions
or
to
speak
at
evidently
disbelieving
what
they
told
and
convinced
that
say
what
she
might
she
would
still
be
told
the
all
the
way
she
had
sat
motionless
in
a
corner
of
the
coach
with
wide
open
and
the
expression
in
them
which
the
countess
knew
so
well
and
feared
so
and
now
she
sat
in
the
same
way
on
the
bench
where
she
had
seated
herself
on
she
was
planning
something
and
either
deciding
or
had
already
decided
something
in
her
the
countess
knew
but
what
it
might
be
she
did
not

this
alarmed
and
tormented
lie
down

replied
irritably
and
she
went
to
the
window
and
opened
through
the
open
window
the
moans
of
the
adjutant
could
be
heard
more
she
put
her
head
out
into
the
damp
night
and
the
countess
saw
her
slim
neck
shaking
with
sobs
and
throbbing
against
the
window
natasha
knew
it
was
not
prince
andrew
who
was
she
knew
prince
andrew
was
in
the
same
yard
as
themselves
and
in
a
part
of
the
hut
across
the
but
this
dreadful
incessant
moaning
made
her
the
countess
exchanged
a
look
with
lie
my
said
the
softly
touching
lie
lie
down
at
said
and
began
hurriedly
tugging
at
the
tapes
of
her
when
she
had
thrown
off
her
dress
and
put
on
a
dressing
she
sat
down
with
her
foot
under
her
on
the
bed
that
had
been
made
up
on
the
jerked
her
thin
and
rather
short
plait
of
hair
to

began
replaiting
her
practiced
fingers
rapidly
and
tied
up
her
her
head
moved
from
side
to
side
from
but
her
feverishly
looked
fixedly
before
when
her
toilet
for
the
night
was
finished
she
sank
gently
onto
the
sheet
spread
over
the
hay
on
the
side

and
stepped
cautiously
on
the
cold
and
dirty
floor
with
her
bare

boards
of
the
floor
stepping
cautiously
from
one
foot
to
the
other
she
ran
like
a
kitten
the
few
steps
to
the
door
and
grasped
the
cold
door
it
seemed
to
her
that
something
heavy
was
beating
rhythmically
against
all
the
walls
of
the
it
was
her
own
sinking
with
alarm
and
terror
and
overflowing
with

opened
the

stepped
across

felt
refreshed

part
of

was

in

the
farthest
on
a
bench
beside
a
bed
on
which
something
was
stood
a
tallow
candle
with
a
and
smoldering
from
the
moment
she
had
been
told
that
morning
of
prince
wound
and
his
presence
natasha
had
resolved
to
see
she
did
not
know
why
she
had
she
knew
the
meeting
would
be
but
felt
the
more
convinced
that
it
was
all
day
she
had
lived
only
in
hope
of
seeing
him
that
but
now
that
the
moment
had
come
she
was
filled
with
dread
of
what
she
might
how
was
he
what
was
left
of
was
he
like
that
incessant
moaning
of
the
he
was
altogether
like
in
her
imagination
he
was
that
terrible
moaning
when
she
saw
an
indistinct
shape
in
the
and
mistook
his
knees
raised
under
the
quilt
for
his
she
imagined
a
horrible
body
and
stood
still
in
but
an
irresistible
impulse
drew
her
she
cautiously
took
one
step
and
then
and
found
herself
in
the
middle
of
a
small
room
containing
another
lying
in
a
corner
on
the
benches
beneath
the

a

up
and
whispered

awake
by
the
pain
in
his
wounded

with
eyes
at
this
strange
apparition
of
a
girl
in
a
white
dressing
and
the
frightened

the
made
natasha
approach
more
swiftly
to
what
was
lying
in
the
horribly
unlike
a
man
as
that
body
she
must
see
she
passed
the
the
snuff
fell
from
the
candle
and
she
saw
prince
andrew
clearly
with
his
arms
outside
the
and
such
as
she
had
always
seen
he
was
the
same
as
but
the
feverish
color
of
his
his
glittering
eyes
rapturously
turned
toward
and
especially
his
delicate
as
a
revealed

the
collar
of
his

him
a
peculiarly
childlike
such
as
she
had
never
seen
on
him

went
up
to
him

with
a
youthful
movement
dropped
on

xxxii
seven
days
had
passed
since
prince
andrew
found
himself
in
the
ambulance
station
on
the
field
of
his
feverish
state
and
the
inflammation
of
his
which
were
were
in
the
opinion
sure
to
carry
him
but
on
the
seventh
day
he
ate
with
pleasure
a
piece
of
bread
with
some
and
the
doctor
noticed
that
his
temperature
was
he
had
regained
consciousness
that
the
first
night
after
they
left
moscow
had
been
fairly
warm
and
he
had
remained
in
the
but
at
mytishchi
the
wounded
man
himself
asked
to
be
taken
out
and
given
some
the
pain
caused
by
his
removal
into
the
hut
had
made
him
groan
aloud
and
again
lose
when
he
had
been
placed
on
his
camp
bed
he
lay
for
a
long
time
motionless
with
closed
then
he
opened
them
and
whispered
the
his
remembering
such
a
small
detail
of
everyday
life
astonished
the
he
felt
prince
and
to
his
surprise
and
dissatisfaction
found
it
had
he
was
dissatisfied
because
he
knew
by
experience
that
if
his
patient
did
not
die
he
would
do
so
a
little
later
with
greater
the
major
of
prince
had
joined
him
in
moscow
and
was
being
taken
along
with
having
been
wounded
in
the
leg
at
the
battle
of
they
were
accompanied
by
a
prince
his
and
two
they
gave
prince
andrew
some
he
drank
it
looking
with
feverish
eyes
at
the
door
in
front
of
him
as
if
trying
to
understand
and
remember
want
any
is
timokhin
he
timokhin
crept
along
the
bench
to
am
your
your
all
but
how
about
prince
andrew
again
pondered
as
if
trying
to
remember
one
get
a
he
i
the
doctor
promised
to
procure
it
for
him
and
began
to
ask
how
he
was
prince
andrew
answered
all
his
questions
reluctantly
but
and
then
said
he
wanted
a
bolster
placed
under
him
as
he
was
uncomfortable
and
in
great
the
doctor
and
valet
lifted
the
cloak
with
which
he
was
covered
making
wry
faces
at
the
noisome
smell
of
mortifying
flesh
that
came
from
the
began
examining
that
dreadful
the
doctor
was
very
much
displeased
about
something
and
made
a
change
in
the
turning
the
wounded
man
over
so
that
he
groaned
again
and
grew
unconscious
and
delirious
from
the
he
kept
asking
them
to
get
him
the
book
and
put
it
under
trouble
would
it
be
to
he
have
not
got
please
get
it
for
me
and
put
it
under
for
a
he
pleaded
in
a
piteous
the
doctor
went
into
the
passage
to
wash
his
fellows
have
no
said
he
to
the
valet
who
was
pouring
water
over
his
just
one
moment
i
look
after
such
you
that
i
wonder
how
he
can
bear
the
lord
jesus
i
thought
we
had
put
something
under
said
the
the
first
time
prince
andrew
understood
where
he
was
and
what
was
the
matter
with
him
and
remembered
being
wounded
and
how
was
when
he
asked
to
be
carried
into
the
hut
after
his
caleche
had
stopped
at
after
growing
confused
from
pain
while
being
carried
into
the
hut
he
again
regained
and
while
drinking
tea
once
more
recalled
all
that
had
happened
to
and
above
all
vividly
remembered
the
moment
at
the
ambulance
station
at
the
sight
of
the
sufferings
of
a
man
he
those
new
thoughts
had
come
to
him
which
promised
him
and
those
though
now
vague
and
again
possessed
his
he
remembered
that
he
had
now
a
new
source
of
happiness
and
that
this
happiness
had
something
to
do
with
the
that
was
why
he
asked
for
a
copy
of
the
uncomfortable
position
in
which
they
had
put
him
and
turned
him
over
again
confused
his
and
when
he
came
to
himself
a
third
time
it
was
in
the
complete
stillness
of
the
everybody
near
him
was
a
cricket
chirped
from
across
the
someone
was
shouting
and
singing
in
the
cockroaches
rustled
on
the
on
the
and
on
the
and
a
big
fly
flopped
at
the
head
of
the
bed
and
around
the
candle
beside
the
wick
of
which
was
charred
and
had
shaped
itself
like
a
his
mind
was
not
in
a
normal
a
healthy
man
usually
thinks
and
remembers
innumerable
things
but
has
the
power
and
will
to
select
one
sequence
of
thoughts
or
events
on
which
to
fix
his
whole
a
healthy
man
can
tear
himself
away
from
the
deepest
reflections
to
say
a
civil
word
to
someone
who
comes
in
and
can
then
return
again
to
his
own
but
prince
mind
was
not
in
a
normal
state
in
that
all
the
powers
of
his
mind
were
more
active
and
clearer
than
but
they
acted
apart
from
his
most
diverse
thoughts
and
images
occupied
him
at
times
his
brain
suddenly
began
to
work
with
a
and
depth
it
had
never
reached
when
he
was
in
but
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
its
work
it
would
turn
to
some
unexpected
idea
and
he
had
not
the
strength
to
turn
it
back
a
new
happiness
was
revealed
to
me
of
which
man
cannot
be
he
thought
as
he
lay
in
the
semidarkness
of
the
quiet
gazing
fixedly
before
him
with
feverish
wide
open
happiness
lying
beyond
material
outside
the
material
influences
that
act
on
happiness
of
the
soul
the
happiness
of
every
man
can
understand
but
to
conceive
it
and
enjoin
it
was
possible
only
for
but
how
did
god
enjoin
that
and
why
was
the
and
suddenly
the
sequence
of
these
thoughts
broke
and
prince
andrew
heard
knowing
whether
it
was
a
delusion
or
a
soft
whispering
voice
incessantly
and
rhythmically
repeating
and
then
and
then
again
and
once
at
the
same
time
he
felt
that
above
his
above
the
very
middle
of
some
strange
airy
structure
was
being
erected
out
of
slender
needles
or
to
the
sound
of
this
whispered
he
felt
that
he
had
to
balance
carefully
it
was
so
that
this
airy
structure
should
not
but
nevertheless
it
kept
collapsing
and
again
slowly
rising
to
the
sound
of
whispered
rhythmic
spreading
out
and
said
prince
andrew
to
while
listening
to
this
whispering
and
feeling
the
sensation
of
this
drawing
out
and
the
construction
of
this
edifice
of
he
also
saw
by
glimpses
a
red
halo
round
the
and
heard
the
rustle
of
the
cockroaches
and
the
buzzing
of
the
fly
that
flopped
against
his
pillow
and
his
each
time
the
fly
touched
his
face
it
gave
him
a
burning
sensation
and
yet
to
his
surprise
it
did
not
destroy
the
though
it
knocked
against
the
very
region
of
his
face
where
it
was
but
besides
this
there
was
something
else
of
it
was
something
white
by
the
statue
of
a
which
also
oppressed
perhaps
my
shirt
on
the
he
my
and
that
is
the
but
why
is
it
always
stretching
and
drawing
itself
and
and
and
please
leave
prince
andrew
painfully
entreated
and
suddenly
thoughts
and
feelings
again
swam
to
the
surface
of
his
mind
with
peculiar
clearness
and
he
thought
again
quite
not
love
which
loves
for
for
some
for
some
or
for
some
but
the
love
which
experienced
when
i
saw
my
enemy
and
yet
loved
i
experienced
that
feeling
of
love
which
is
the
very
essence
of
the
soul
and
does
not
require
an
now
again
i
feel
that
to
love
to
love
to
love
to
love
god
in
all
his
it
is
possible
to
love
someone
dear
to
you
with
human
but
an
enemy
can
only
be
loved
by
divine
that
is
why
i
experienced
such
joy
when
i
felt
that
i
loved
that
what
has
become
of
is
he
loving
with
human
love
one
may
pass
from
love
to
but
divine
love
cannot
neither
death
nor
anything
else
can
destroy
it
is
the
very
essence
of
the
yet
how
many
people
have
i
hated
in
my
and
of
them
i
loved
and
hated
none
as
i
did
and
he
vividly
pictured
to
himself
not
as
he
had
done
in
the
past
with
nothing
but
her
charms
which
gave
him
but
for
the
first
time
picturing
to
himself
her
and
he
understood
her
her
and
he
now
understood
for
the
first
time
all
the
cruelty
of
his
rejection
of
the
cruelty
of
his
rupture
with
only
it
were
possible
for
me
to
see
her
once
just
looking
into
those
eyes
to
and
and
flopped
the
and
his
attention
was
suddenly
carried
into
another
a
world
of
reality
and
delirium
in
which
something
particular
was
in
that
world
some
structure
was
still
being
erected
and
did
not
something
was
still
stretching
and
the
candle
with
its
red
halo
was
still
and
the
same
shirtlike
sphinx
lay
near
the
but
besides
all
this
something
there
was
a
whiff
of
fresh
and
a
new
white
sphinx
standing
at
the
and
that
sphinx
had
the
pale
face
and
shining
eyes
of
the
very
natasha
of
whom
he
had
just
been
how
oppressive
this
continual
delirium
thought
prince
trying
to
drive
that
face
from
his
but
the
face
remained
before
him
with
the
force
of
reality
and
drew
prince
andrew
wished
to
return
to
that
former
world
of
pure
but
he
could
and
delirium
drew
him
back
into
its
the
soft
whispering
voice
continued
its
rhythmic
something
oppressed
him
and
stretched
and
the
strange
face
was
before
prince
andrew
collected
all
his
strength
in
an
effort
to
recover
his
he
moved
a
and
suddenly
there
was
a
ringing
in
his
a
dimness
in
his
and
like
a
man
plunged
into
water
he
lost
when
he
came
to
that
same
living
natasha
whom
of
all
people
he
most
longed
to
love
with
this
new
pure
divine
love
that
had
been
revealed
to
was
kneeling
before
he
realized
that
it
was
the
real
living
and
he
was
not
surprised
but
quietly
motionless
on
her
knees
was
unable
to

frightened
eyes
riveted
on

restraining
her
her
face
was
pale
and
only
in
the
lower
part
of
it
something
prince
andrew
sighed
with
and
held
out
his
he
with
a
rapid
but
careful
movement
natasha
drew
nearer
to
him
on
her
knees
taking
his
hand
bent
her
face
over
it
and
began
kissing
just
touching
it
lightly
with
her
she
raising
her
head
and
glancing
at
love
said
prince
he
me
for
what
i
faltered
natasha
in
a
scarcely
broken
and
began
kissing
his
hand
more
just
touching
it
with
her
love

better
than
said
prince
lifting
her
face
with
his
hand
so
as
to
look
into
her
those
filled
with
happy
gazed
at
him
and
with
joyous
thin
pale
with
its
swollen
was
more
than
was
but
prince
andrew
did
not
see

saw
her
shining
eyes

his
bare

with
the

something
shameful

something

what

took
the

about

to
him
for
the

he
certainly
could
not

said
to

when
planning
his
design
he
had
more
than
once
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
chief
mistake
made
by
the
student
in
1809
had
been
to
try
to
kill
napoleon
with
a

as
his
chief
aim
consisted
not
in
carrying
out
his
but
in
proving
to
himself
that
he
would
not
abandon
his
intention
and
was
doing
all
he
could
to
achieve
pierre
hastily
took
the
blunt
jagged
dagger
in
a
green
sheath
which
he
had
bought
at
the
sukharev
market
with
the

hid
it
under
his
having
tied
a
girdle
over
his
coat
and
pulled
his
cap
low
on
his
pierre
went
down

trying
to
avoid
making
a
noise
or
meeting
the
and
passed
out
into
the
the
at
which
he
had
looked
with
so
much
indifference
the
evening

greatly
increased

on
fire
in
several
the
buildings

the
as

as
the
barges
on

moskva
river

the
timber
yards
by

dorogomilov
were
all
way

through
side
streets
to
the
povarskoy
and
from
there
to
the
church
of
nicholas
on
the
where
he
had
long
before
decided
that
the
deed
should
be
the
gates
of
most
of
the
houses
were
locked
and
the
shutters
the
streets
and
lanes
were
the
air
was
full
of
smoke
and
the
smell
of
now
and
then
he
met
russians
with
anxious
and
timid
and
frenchmen
with
an
air
not
of
the
city
but
of
the
walking
in
the
middle
of
the
both
the
russians
and
the
french
looked
at
pierre
with
besides
his
height
and
and
the
strange
morose
look
of
suffering
in
his
face
and
whole
the
russians
stared
at
pierre
because
they
could
not
make
out
to
what
class
he
could
the
french
followed
him
with
astonishment
in
their
eyes
chiefly
because
unlike
all
the
other
russians
who
gazed
at
the
french
with
fear
and
paid
no
attention
to
at
the
gate
of
one
house
three
who
were
explaining
something
to
some
russians
who
did
not
understand
stopped
pierre
asking
if
he
did
not
know
pierre
shook
his
head
and
went
in
another
side
street
a
sentinel
standing
beside
a
green
caisson
shouted
at
but
only
when
the
shout
was
threateningly
repeated
and
he
heard
the
click
of
the
musket
as
he
raised
it
did
pierre
understand
that
he
had
to
pass
on
the
other
side
of
the
he
heard
nothing
and
saw
nothing
of
what
went
on
around
he
carried
his
resolution
within
himself
in
terror
and
like
something
dreadful
and
alien
to
after
the
previous
he
was
afraid
of
losing
but
he
was
not
destined
to
bring
his
mood
safely
to
his
and
even
had
he
not
been
hindered
by
anything

his
intention

not
now
have

carried

passed
the

more
than
four
hours
previously
on
his
way
from
the
dorogomilov
suburb

now
sitting
in
a
very
gloomy
frame
of

did

in

lay
before
and
was

who
obstinately
undertake
a
task
that
is
impossible
for

not

difficulty

because

incompatibility

fear
of
weakening
at
the
decisive
moment
and
so
losing

though
he
heard

saw
nothing
around
him
he
found
his
way
by
instinct

did
not
go
wrong
in
the
side

that
led
to
the
as
pierre
approached
that
street
the
smoke
became
denser
and
even
felt
the
heat
of
the
occasionally
curly
tongues
of
flame
rose
from
under
the
roofs
of

met
more
people
in

streets

they
were
more

though
he
felt
that
something
unusual
was
happening
around

not

moment
a
mounted
patrol
of
french
uhlans
appeared
from

up
at
a
trot
to

the
frenchman
and
surrounded

nothing
of
what

only
remembered
beating

with
greater

the

between

the

its
old
way

made
it

to
realize
the
danger
and
the
difficult
position
of
the
russian
there
were
the
same
receptions
and
the

french
the

in

difficulties
of

actual
stories
were
whispered
of
how
differently
the
two
empresses
behaved
in

for
the
welfare
of

directions
that

should
all
be
removed
to

the
things
belonging
to
these
institutions
had
already
been
packed
the
empress
when
asked
what
instructions
she
would
be
pleased
to
her
characteristic
russian
patriotism
had
replied
that
she
could
give
no
directions
about
state
institutions
for
that
was
the
affair
of
the
but
as
far
as
she
personally
was
concerned
she
would
be
the
last
to
quit
at
anna
on
the
of
the
very
day
of
the
battle
of
there
was
a
the
chief
feature
of
which
was
to
be
the
reading
of
a
letter
from
his
lordship
the
bishop
when
sending
the
emperor
an
icon
of
the
venerable

was
regarded
as
a
model
of
patriotic
prince
vasili
famed
for
his

to
read
used
to
read
at
the
the
art
of
his
reading
was
supposed
to
lie
in
rolling
out
the
quite
independently
of
their
in
a
loud
and
singsong
voice
alternating
between
a
despairing
wail
and
a
tender
so
that
the
wail
fell
quite
at
random
on
one
word
and
the
murmur
on
this
as
was
always
the
case
at
anna
had
a
political
that
evening
she
expected
several
important
personages
who
had
to
be
made
ashamed
of
their
visits
to
the
french
theater
and
aroused
to
a
patriotic
a
good
many
people
had
already
but
anna
not
yet
seeing
all
those
whom
she
wanted
in
her
drawing
did
not
let
the
reading
begin
but
wound
up
the
springs
of
a
general
the
news
of
the
day
in
petersburg
was
the
illness
of
countess
she
had
fallen
ill
unexpectedly
a
few
days
had
missed
several
gatherings
of
which
she
was
usually
and
was
said
to
be
receiving
no
and
instead
of
the
celebrated
petersburg
doctors
who
usually
attended
her
had
entrusted
herself
to
some
italian
doctor
who
was
treating
her
in
some
new
and
unusual
they
all
knew
very
well
that
the
enchanting
illness
arose
from
an
inconvenience
resulting
from
marrying
two
husbands
at
the
same
and
that
the
cure
consisted
in
removing
such
but
in
anna
presence
no
one
dared
to
think
of
this
or
even
appear
to
know
say
the
poor
countess
is
very
the
doctor
says
it
is
angina
a
terrible
say
that
the
rivals
are
thanks
to
the
and
the
word
angina
was
repeated
with
great
count
is
they
he
cried
like
a
child
when
the
doctor
told
him
the
case
was
it
would
be
a
terrible
she
is
an
enchanting
are
speaking
of
the
poor
said
anna
coming
up
just
sent
to
ask
for
and
hear
that
she
is
a
little
she
is
certainly
the
most
charming
woman
in
the
she
went
with
a
smile
at
her
own
belong
to
different
but
that
does
not
prevent
my
esteeming
her
as
she
she
is
very
added
anna
supposing
that
by
these
words
anna
pavlovna
was
somewhat
lifting
the
veil
from
the
secret
of
the
an
unwary
young
man
ventured
to
express
surprise
that
well
known
doctors
had
not
been
called
in
and
that
the
countess
was
being
attended
by
a
charlatan
who
might
employ
dangerous
information
may
be
better
than
anna
pavlovna
suddenly
and
venomously
retorted
on
the
inexperienced
young
i
know
on
good
authority
that
this
doctor
is
a
very
learned
and
able
he
is
private
physician
to
the
queen
of
and
having
thus
demolished
the
young
anna
pavlovna
turned
to
another
group
where
bilibin
was
talking
about
the
having
wrinkled
up
his
face
he
was
evidently
preparing
to
smooth
it
out
again
and
utter
one
of
his
think
it
is
he
referring
to
a
diplomatic
note
that
had
been
sent
to
vienna
with
some
austrian
banners
captured
from
the
french
by
hero
of
as
he
was
then
called
in
asked
anna
securing
silence
for
the
which
she
had
heard
and
bilibin
repeated
the
actual
words
of
the
diplomatic
which
he
had
himself
emperor
returns
these
austrian
said
banners
gone
astray
and
found
on
a
wrong
and
his
brow
became
smooth
observed
prince
path
to
prince
hippolyte
remarked
loudly
and
everybody
looked
at
understanding
what
he
prince
hippolyte
himself
glanced
around
with
amused
he
knew
no
more
than
the
others
what
his
words
during
his
diplomatic
career
he
had
more
than
once
noticed
that
such
utterances
were
received
as
very
and
at
every
opportunity
he
uttered
in
that
way
the
first
words
that
entered
his
may
turn
out
very
he
if
know
how
to
arrange
and
during
the
awkward
silence
that
that
insufficiently
patriotic
person
entered
whom
anna
pavlovna
had
been
waiting
for
and
wished
to
and
smiling
and
shaking
a
finger
at
invited
prince
vasili
to
the
table
and
bringing
him
two
candles
and
the
manuscript
begged
him
to
everyone
became
gracious
sovereign
and
prince
vasili
sternly
looking
round
at
his
audience
as
if
to
inquire
whether
anyone
had
anything
to
say
to
the
but
no
one
said
our
ancient
the
new
receives
her
placed
a
sudden
emphasis
on
the
word
a
mother
receives
her
zealous
sons
into
her
and
through
the
gathering
foreseeing
the
brilliant
glory
of
thy
sings
in
blessed
is
he
that
prince
vasili
pronounced
these
last
words
in
a
tearful
bilibin
attentively
examined
his
and
many
of
those
present
appeared
as
if
asking
in
what
they
were
to
anna
pavlovna
whispered
the
next
words
in
like
an
old
woman
muttering
the
prayer
at
the
bold
and
insolent
she

a
was
uttered
in
approval
both
of

and
of
animated
by
that
address
anna
guests
talked
for
a
long
time
of
the
state
of
the
fatherland
and
offered
various
conjectures
as
to
the
result
of
the
battle
to
be
fought
in
a
few
will
said
anna
on
the
we
shall

a
favorable
chapter
ii
anna
presentiment
was
in
fact
next
day
during
the
service
at
the
palace
church
in
honor
of
the
prince
volkonski
was
called
out
of
the
church
and
received
a
dispatch
from
prince
it
was
written
from
tatarinova
on
the
day
of
the
kutuzov
wrote
that
the
russians
had
not
retreated
a
that
the
french
losses
were
much
heavier
than
and
that
he
was
writing
in
haste
from
the
field
of
battle
before
collecting
full
it
followed
that
there
must
have
been
a
and
at
without
leaving
the
thanks
were
rendered
to
the
creator
for
his
help
and
for
the
anna
presentiment
was
and
all
that
morning
a
joyously
festive
mood
reigned
in
the
everyone
believed
the
victory
to
have
been
and
some
even
spoke
of
having
been
of
his
and
of
the
choice
of
a
new
ruler
for
it
is
very
difficult
for
events
to
be
reflected
in
their
real
strength
and
completeness
amid
the
conditions
of
court
life
and
far
from
the
scene
of
general
events
involuntarily
group
themselves
around
some
particular
so
now
the
pleasure
was
based
as
much
on
the
fact
that
the
news
had
arrived
on
the
birthday
as
on
the
fact
of
the
victory
it
was
like
a
successfully
arranged
mention
was
made
in
report
of
the
russian
among
which
figured
the
names
of
and
in
the
petersburg
world
this
sad
side
of
the
affair
again
involuntarily
centered
round
a
single
everybody
knew
the
emperor
liked
and
he
was
young
and
that
day
everyone
met
with
the
a
wonderful
just
during
the
but
what
a
loss
kutaysov
how
sorry
i
did
i
tell
about
prince
vasili
now
said
with
a
always
said
he
was
the
only
man
capable
of
defeating
but
next
day
no
news
arrived
from
the
army
and
the
public
mood
grew
the
courtiers
suffered
because
of
the
suffering
the
suspense
occasioned
the
the
said
and
instead
of
extolling
kutuzov
as
they
had
done
the
day
they
condemned
him
as
the
cause
of
the
that
day
prince
vasili
no
longer
boasted
of
his
protege
but
remained
silent
when
the
was
toward
as
if
everything
conspired
to
make
petersburg
society
anxious
and
a
terrible
piece
of
news
was
countess
helene
bezukhova
had
suddenly
died
of
that
terrible
malady
it
had
been
so
agreeable
to
at
large
everyone
said
that
countess
bezukhova
had
died
of
a
terrible
attack
of
angina
but
in
intimate
circles
details
were
mentioned
of
how
the
private
physician
of
the
queen
of
spain
had
prescribed
small
doses
of
a
certain
drug
to
produce
a
certain
but
tortured
by
the
fact
that
the
old
count
suspected
her
and
that
her
husband
to
whom
she
had
written
profligate
had
not
had
suddenly
taken
a
very
large
dose
of
the
and
had
died
in
agony
before
assistance
could
be
rendered
it
was
said
that
prince
vasili
and
the
old
count
had
turned
upon
the
but
the
latter
had
produced
such
letters
from
the
unfortunate
deceased
that
they
had
immediately
let
the
matter
talk
in
general
centered
round
three
melancholy
the
lack
of
the
loss
of
and
the
death
of
on
the
third
day
after
report
a
country
gentleman
arrived
from
and
news
of
the
surrender
of
moscow
to
the
french
spread
through
the
whole
this
was
what
a
position
for
the
emperor
to
be
kutuzov
was
a
and
prince
vasili
during
the
visits
of
condolence
paid
to
him
on
the
occasion
of
his
death
said
of
whom
he
had
formerly
praised
was
excusable
for
him
in
his
grief
to
forget
what
he
had
that
it
was
impossible
to
expect
anything
else
from
a
blind
and
depraved
old
only
wonder
that
the
fate
of
russia
could
have
been
entrusted
to
such
a
as
long
as
this
news
remained
unofficial
it
was
possible
to
doubt
but
the
next
day
the
following
communication
was
received
from
count
prince
adjutant
has
brought
me
a
letter
in
which
he
demands
police
officers
to
guide
the
army
to
the
ryazan
he
writes
that
he
is
regretfully
abandoning
action
decides
the
fate
of
the
capital
and
of
your
russia
will
shudder
to
learn
of
the
abandonment
of
the
city
in
which
her
greatness
is
centered
and
in
which
lie
the
ashes
of
your
i
shall
follow
the
i
have
had
everything
and
it
only
remains
for
me
to
weep
over
the
fate
of
my
on
receiving
this
dispatch
the
emperor

prince
volkonski
to
kutuzov
with
the
following
prince

the
sad
news
that

effect

your
silence
increases
my
i
am
sending
this
by
prince
to
hear
from

the
situation

the
reasons

to
take
this
melancholy
chapter
iii
nine
days
after
the
abandonment
of
a
messenger
from
kutuzov
reached
petersburg
with
the
official
announcement
of
that
this
messenger
was
a
frenchman
who
did
not
know
but
who
was
quoique
russe
de
coeur
et
as
he
said
of
though
a
russian
in
heart
and
the
emperor
at
once
received
this
messenger
in
his
study
at
the
palace
on
stone
who
had
never
seen
moscow
before
the
campaign
and
who
did
not
know
yet
felt
deeply
moved
he
when
he
appeared
before
notre
tres
gracieux
souverain
with
the
news
of
the
burning
of
dont
les
flammes
eclairaient
sa
our
most
gracious
whose
flames
illumined
his
though
the
source
of
chagrin
must
have
been
different
from
that
which
caused
russians
to
he
had
such
a
sad
face
when
shown
into
the
study
that
the
latter
at
once
you
brought
me
sad
replied
lowering
his
eyes
with
a
abandonment
of
they
surrendered
my
ancient
capital
without
a

the
emperor
his
face
suddenly
michaud
respectfully
delivered
the
message
kutuzov
had
entrusted
to
which
was
that
it
had
been
impossible
to
fight
before
and
that
as
the
only
remaining
choice
was
between
losing
the
army
as
well
as
or
losing
moscow
the
field
marshal
had
to
choose

listened
in
not
looking
at
the
enemy
entered
the

moscow
is
now
in

left
it
all
in
replied
michaud
in
a
decided
but
glancing
at
the
emperor
he
was
frightened
by
what
he
had
the
emperor
began
to
breathe
heavily
and
his
lower
lip
and
tears
instantly
appeared
in
his
fine
blue
but
this
lasted
only
a
he
suddenly
as
if
blaming
himself
for
his
and
raising
his
head
addressed
michaud
in
a
firm
from
all
that
is
that
providence
requires
great
sacrifices
of
i
am
ready
to
submit
myself
in
all
things
to
his
but
tell
how
did
you
leave
the
army
when
it
saw
my
ancient
capital
abandoned
without
a
did
you
not
notice
seeing
that
his
most
gracious
ruler
was
calm
once
michaud
also
grew
but
was
not
immediately
ready
to
reply
to
the
direct
and
relevant
question
which
required
a
direct
will
you
allow
me
to
speak
frankly
as
befits
a
loyal
he
asked
to
gain
i
always
require
replied
the
nothing
from
i
wish
to
know
absolutely
how
things
said
michaud
with
a
scarcely
perceptible
smile
on
his
having
now
prepared
a

left
the
whole

its
chiefs
to
the
lowest
without
exception
in
desperate
and
agonized
is
the
emperor
interrupted
frowning

make
my
russians
lose
michaud
had
only
waited
for
this
to
bring
out
the
phrase
he
had
he
with
respectful
are
only
afraid
lest
your
in
the
goodness
of
your
should
allow
yourself
to
be
persuaded
to
make

are
burning
for
the

this
representative
of
the
russian
to
prove
to
your
majesty
by
the
sacrifice
of
their
lives
how
devoted
they
said
the
emperor
and
with
a
kindly
gleam
in
his
he
patted
michaud
on
the
set
me
at
he
bent
his
head
and
was
silent
for
some
go
back
to
the
he
drawing
himself
up
to
his
full
height
and
addressing
michaud
with
a
gracious
and
majestic

brave

all
my
good
subjects

when

put
myself
at

beloved
nobility
and
my
good
peasants
and
so
use
the
last
resources
of

still
offers
me
more
than
my
enemies
said
the
emperor
growing
more
and
more
should
it
ever
be
ordained
by
divine
he
raising
to
heaven
his
fine
eyes
shining
with
my
dynasty
should
cease
to
reign
on
the
throne
of

then
after
exhausting
all
the
means
at
my
i
shall
let
my
beard
grow
to
pointed
halfway
down
his
go
and
eat
potatoes
with
the
meanest
of
my
rather
than
sign
the
disgrace
of
my
country
and
of
my
beloved
people
whose
sacrifices
i
know
how
to
having
uttered
these
words
in
an
agitated
voice
the
emperor
suddenly
turned
away
as
if
to
hide
from
michaud
the
tears
that
rose
to
his
and
went
to
the
further
end
of
his
having
stood
there
a
few
he
strode
back
to
michaud
and
pressed
his
arm
below
the
elbow
with
a
vigorous
the
mild
and
handsome
face
was
flushed
and
his
eyes
gleamed
with
resolution
and
do
not
forget
what
i
say
to
you
perhaps
we
may
recall
it
with
pleasure
napoleon
or
said
the
touching
his
can
no
longer
both
reign
i
have
learned
to
know
and
he
will
not
deceive
me
any
and
the
emperor
with
a
when
he
heard
these
words
and
saw
the
expression
of
firm
resolution
in
the
russe
de
coeur
et
at
that
solemn
moment
felt
himself
enraptured
by
all
that
he
had
heard
he
used
afterwards
to
and
gave
expression
to
his
own
feelings
and
those
of
the
russian
people
whose
representative
he
considered
himself
to
in
the
following
said
majesty
is
at
this
moment
signing
the
glory
of
the
nation
and
the
salvation
of
with
an
inclination
of
the
head
the
emperor
dismissed
chapter
iv
it
is
natural
for
us
who
were
not
living
in
those
days
to
imagine
that
when
half
russia
had
been
conquered
and
the
inhabitants
were
fleeing
to
distant
and
one
levy
after
another
was
being
raised
for
the
defense
of
the
all
russians
from
the
greatest
to
the
least
were
solely
engaged
in
sacrificing
saving
their
or
weeping
over
its
the
tales
and
descriptions
of
that
time
without
exception
speak
only
of
the
patriotic
and
the
heroism
of
the
but
it
was
not
really
it
appears
so
to
us
because
we
see
only
the
general
historic
interest
of
that
time
and
do
not
see
all
the
personal
human
interests
that
people
yet
in
reality
those
personal
interests
of
the
moment
so
much
transcend
the
general
interests
that
they
always
prevent
the
public
interest
from
being
felt
or
even
most
of
the
people
at
that
time
paid
no
attention
to
the
general
progress
of
events
but
were
guided
only
by
their
private
and
they
were
the
very
people
whose
activities
at
that
period
were
most
those
who
tried
to
understand
the
general
course
of
events
and
to
take
part
in
it
by
and
heroism
were
the
most
useless
members
of
they
saw
everything
upside
and
all
they
did
for
the
common
good
turned
out
to
be
useless
and
and
regiments
which
looted
russian
and
the
lint
the
young
ladies
prepared
and
that
never
reached
the
and
so
even
fond
of
intellectual
talk
and
of
expressing
their
who
discussed
position
at
the
time
involuntarily
introduced
into
their
conversation
either
a
shade
of
pretense
and
falsehood
or
useless
condemnation
and
anger
directed
against
people
accused
of
actions
no
one
could
possibly
be
guilty
in
historic
events
the
rule
forbidding
us
to
eat
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
is
specially
only
unconscious
action
bears
and
he
who
plays
a
part
in
an
historic
event
never
understands
its
if
he
tries
to
realize
it
his
efforts
are
the
more
closely
a
man
was
engaged
in
the
events
then
taking
place
in
russia
the
less
did
he
realize
their
in
petersburg
and
in
the
provinces
at
a
distance
from
and
gentlemen
in
militia
wept
for
russia
and
its
ancient
capital
and
talked
of
and
so
but
in
the
army
which
retired
beyond
moscow
there
was
little
talk
or
thought
of
and
when
they
caught
sight
of
its
burned
ruins
no
one
swore
to
be
avenged
on
the
but
they
thought
about
their
next
their
next
of
matreshka
the
and
like
as
the
war
had
caught
him
in
the
nicholas
rostov
took
a
close
and
prolonged
part
in
the
defense
of
his
but
did
so
without
any
aim
at
and
he
therefore
looked
at
what
was
going
on
in
russia
without
despair
and
without
dismally
racking
his
brains
over
had
he
been
asked
what
he
thought
of
the
state
of
he
would
have
said
that
it
was
not
his
business
to
think
about
that
kutuzov
and
others
were
there
for
that
but
that
he
had
heard
that
the
regiments
were
to
be
made
up
to
their
full
that
fighting
would
probably
go
on
for
a
long
time
and
that
things
being
so
it
was
quite
likely
he
might
be
in
command
of
a
regiment
in
a
couple
of
as
he
looked
at
the
matter
in
this
he
learned
that
he
was
being
sent
to
voronezh
to
buy
remounts
for
his
not
only
without
regret
at
being
prevented
from
taking
part
in
the
coming
but
with
the
greatest
he
did
not
conceal
and
which
his
comrades
fully
a
few
days
before
the
battle
of
nicholas
received
the
necessary
money
and
and
having
sent
some
hussars
on
in
he
set
out
with
post
horses
for
only
a
man
who
has
experienced
has
passed
some
months
continuously
in
an
atmosphere
of
campaigning
and
understand
the
delight
nicholas
felt
when
he
escaped
from
the
region
covered
by
the
foraging
provision
and
from
and
the
filthy
traces
of
a
saw
villages
with
peasants
and
peasant
country
fields
where
cattle
were
posthouses
with
stationmasters
asleep
in
he
rejoiced
as
though
seeing
all
this
for
the
first
what
for
a
long
while
specially
surprised
and
delighted
him
were
the
young
and
without
a
dozen
officers
making
up
to
each
of
who
were
pleased
and
flattered
that
a
passing
officer
should
joke
with
in
the
highest
spirits
nicholas
arrived
at
night
at
a
hotel
in
ordered
things
he
had
long
been
deprived
of
in
and
next
very
and
in
a
uniform
he
had
not
worn
for
a
long
went
to
present
himself
to
the
the
commander
of
the
militia
was
a
civilian
an
old
man
who
was
evidently
pleased
with
his
military
designation
and
he
received
nicholas
brusquely
this
to
be
characteristically
and
questioned
him
with
an
important
as
if
considering
the
general
progress
of
affairs
and
approving
and
disapproving
with
full
right
to
do
nicholas
was
in
such
good
spirits
that
this
merely
amused
from
the
commander
of
the
militia
he
drove
to
the
the
governor
was
a
brisk
little
very
simple
and
he
indicated
the
stud
farms
at
which
nicholas
might
procure
recommended
to
him
a
horse
dealer
in
the
town
and
a
landowner
fourteen
miles
out
of
town
who
had
the
best
and
promised
to
assist
him
in
every
are
count
ilya
my
wife
was
a
great
friend
of
your
we
are
at
home
on
is
so
please
come
and
see
us
quite
said
the
taking
leave
of
immediately
on
leaving
the
nicholas
hired
post
horses
taking
his
squadron
quartermaster
with
drove
at
a
gallop
to
the
fourteen
miles
who
had
the
everything
seemed
to
him
pleasant
and
easy
during
that
first
part
of
his
stay
in
voronezh
as
usually
happens
when
a
man
is
in
a
pleasant
state
of
everything
went
well
and
the
landowner
to
whom
nicholas
went
was
a
an
old
a
horse
a
the
possessor
of
some
brandy
and
some
old
hungarian
who
had
a
snuggery
where
he
and
who
owned
some
splendid
in
very
few
words
nicholas
bought
seventeen
picked
stallions
for
six
thousand
as
he
as
samples
of
his
after
dining
and
taking
rather
too
much
of
the
hungarian
having
exchanged
kisses
with
the
with
whom
he
was
already
on
the
friendliest
back
over
abominable
in
the
brightest
frame
of
continually
urging
on
the
driver
so
as
to
be
in
time
for
the
when
he
had
poured
water
over
his
and
scented
nicholas
arrived
at
the
rather
but
with
the
phrase
late
than
on
his
it
was
not
a
nor
had
dancing
been
but
everyone
knew
that
catherine
petrovna
would
play
valses
and
the
ecossaise
on
the
clavichord
and
that
there
would
be
and
so
everyone
had
come
as
to
a
provincial
life
in
1812
went
on
very
much
as
but
with
this
that
it
was
livelier
in
the
towns
in
consequence
of
the
arrival
of
many
wealthy
families
from
and
as
in
everything
that
went
on
in
russia
at
that
time
a
special
recklessness
was
an
for
a
in
for
a
and
the
inevitable
small
instead
of
turning
on
the
weather
and
mutual
now
turned
on
the
and
the
society
gathered
together
at
the
was
the
best
in
there
were
a
great
many
ladies
and
some
of
moscow
but
there
were
no
men
who
could
at
all
vie
with
the
cavalier
of
the
hussar
remount
the
and
count
among
the
men
was
an
italian
an
officer
of
the
french
and
nicholas
felt
that
the
presence
of
that
prisoner
enhanced
his
own
importance
as
a
russian
the
italian
as
it
a
war
nicholas
felt
it
seemed
to
him
that
everyone
regarded
the
italian
in
the
same
and
he
treated
him
cordially
though
with
dignity
and
as
soon
as
nicholas
entered
in
his
hussar
diffusing
around
him
a
fragrance
of
perfume
and
and
had
uttered
the
words
late
than
and
heard
them
repeated
several
times
by
people
clustered
around
all
eyes
turned
on
and
he
felt
at
once
that
he
had
entered
into
his
proper
position
in
the
of
a
universal
a
very
pleasant
and
intoxicatingly
so
after
his
long
at
posting
at
and
in
the
maidservants
had
been
flattered
by
his
and
here
too
at
the
party
there
were
it
seemed
to
an
inexhaustible
number
of
pretty
young
married
and
impatiently
awaiting
his
the
women
and
girls
flirted
with
him
from
the
first
the
people
concerned
themselves
to
get
this
fine
young
daredevil
of
an
hussar
married
and
settled
among
these
was
the
wife
who
welcomed
rostov
as
a
near
relative
and
called
him
catherine
petrovna
did
actually
play
valses
and
the
and
dancing
began
in
which
nicholas
still
further
captivated
the
provincial
society
by
his
his
particularly
free
manner
of
dancing
even
surprised
them
nicholas
was
himself
rather
surprised
at
the
way
he
danced
that
he
had
never
danced
like
that
in
moscow
and
would
even
have
considered
such
a
very
free
and
easy
manner
improper
and
in
bad
but
here
he
felt
it
incumbent
on
him
to
astonish
them
all
by
something
something
they
would
have
to
accept
as
the
regular
thing
in
the
capital
though
new
to
them
in
the
all
the
evening
nicholas
paid
attention
to
a
plump
and
pleasing
little
the
wife
of
one
of
the
provincial
with
the
naive
conviction
of
young
men
in
a
merry
mood
that
other
wives
were
created
for
rostov
did
not
leave
the
side
and
treated
her
husband
in
a
friendly
and
conspiratorial
as
without
speaking
of
they
knew
how
capitally
nicholas
and
the
lady
would
get
on
the
did
not
seem
to
share
that
conviction
and
tried
to
behave
morosely
with
but
the
naivete
was
so
boundless
that
sometimes
even
he
involuntarily
yielded
to
good
toward
the
end
of
the
as
the
face
grew
more
flushed
and
the
became
more
and
more
melancholy
and
as
though
there
were
but
a
given
amount
of
animation
between
them
and
as
the
share
increased
the
chapter
v
nicholas
sat
leaning
slightly
forward
in
an
bending
closely
over
the
blonde
lady
and
paying
her
mythological
compliments
with
a
smile
that
never
left
his
jauntily
shifting
the
position
of
his
legs
in
their
tight
riding
diffusing
an
odor
of
and
admiring
his
and
the
fine
outlines
of
his
legs
in
their
hessian
nicholas
told
the
blonde
lady
that
he
wished
to
run

at

up
and
sullenly
asked
his

she
was
talking

rising
and
as
if
wishing
nikita
ivanych
to
share
his

began
to
tell
him
of
his
intention
to
elope
with
a
blonde
the
husband
smiled
the
wife
the
wife
came
up
with
a
look
of
ignatyevna
wants
to
see
said
pronouncing
the
name
so
that
nicholas
at
once
understood
that
anna
ignatyevna
was
a
very
important
you
know
you
let
me
call
you
who
is

of

here
in
voronezh
with
her
how
you
a
please
very
what
a
fellow
you
the
wife
led
him
up
to
a
tall
and
very
stout
old
lady
with
a
blue
who
had
just
finished
her
game
of
cards
with
the
most
important
personages
of
the
this
was
princess
aunt
on
her
a
childless
widow
who
always
lived
in
when
rostov
approached
her
she
was
standing
settling
up
for
the
she
looked
at
him
screwing
up
her
eyes
continued
to
upbraid
the
general
who
had
won
from
mon
she
then
holding
out
her
hand
to
come
and
see
after
a
few
words
about
princess
mary
and
her
late
whom
malvintseva
had
evidently
not
and
having
asked
what
nicholas
knew
of
prince
who
also
was
evidently
no
favorite
of
the
important
old
lady
dismissed
nicholas
after
repeating
her
invitation
to
come
to
see
nicholas
promised
to
come
and
blushed
again
as
he
at
the
mention
of
princess
mary
he
experienced
a
feeling
of
shyness
and
even
of
which
he
himself
did
not
when
he
had
parted
from
malvintseva
nicholas
wished
to
return
to
the
but
the
little
wife
placed
her
plump
hand
on
his
sleeve
saying
that
she
wanted
to
have
a
talk
with
led
him
to
her
sitting
from
which
those
who
were
there
immediately
withdrew
so
as
not
to
be
in
her
you
dear
began
the
wife
with
a
serious
expression
on
her
kind
little
really
would
be
the
match
for
would
you
like
me
to
arrange
do
you
asked
will
make
a
match
for
you
with
the
catherine
petrovna
speaks
of
but
i
do
you
want
me
to
do
i
am
sure
your
mother
will
be
grateful
to
what
a
charming
girl
she
and
she
is
not
at
all
so
at
replied
nicholas
as
if
offended
at
the
befits
a
i
force
myself
on
anyone
or
refuse
he
said
before
he
had
time
to
consider
what
he
was
this
is
not
a
course
the
wife
said
as
if
talking
to
my
dear
among
other
things
you
are
too
attentive
to
the
the
one
is
sorry
for
the
we
are
good
friends
with
said
nicholas
in
the
simplicity
of
his
it
did
not
enter
his
head
that
a
pastime
so
pleasant
to
himself
might
not
be
pleasant
to
someone
what
nonsense
i
have
been
saying
to
the
thought
nicholas
suddenly
at
will
really
begin
to
arrange
a
and
and
on
taking
leave
of
the
when
she
again
smilingly
said
to
he
drew
her
see
to
tell
the
is
my
sit
down
said
nicholas
suddenly
felt
a
desire
and
need
to
tell
his
most
intimate
thoughts
he
would
not
have
told
to
his
his
or
his
to
this
woman
who
was
almost
a
when
he
afterwards
recalled
that
impulse
to
unsolicited
and
inexplicable
frankness
which
had
very
important
results
for
it
seemed
to
it
seems
to
everyone
in
such
it
was
merely
some
silly
whim
that
seized
yet
that
burst
of
together
with
other
trifling
had
immense
consequences
for
him
and
for
all
his
mamma
has
long
wanted
me
to
marry
an
but
the
very
idea
of
marrying
for
money
is
repugnant
to
i
said
the
princess
another
i
will
tell
you
the
in
the
first
place
i
like
her
very
i
feel
drawn
to
and
after
i
met
her
under
such
the
idea
often
occurred
to
is
especially
if
you
remember
that
mamma
had
long
been
thinking
of
but
i
had
never
happened
to
meet
her
somehow
it
had
always
happened
that
we
did
not
and
as
long
as
my
sister
natasha
was
engaged
to
her
brother
it
was
of
course
out
of
the
question
for
me
to
think
of
marrying
and
it
must
needs
happen
that
i
should
meet
her
just
when
engagement
had
been
broken
and
then
so
you
i
never
told
this
to
anyone
and
never
only
to
the
wife
pressed
his
elbow
know
my
i
love
and
promised
to
marry
and
will
do
so
you
see
there
can
be
no
question
said
nicholas
incoherently
and
dear
what
a
way
to
look
at
you
know
sonya
has
nothing
and
you
yourself
say
your
affairs
are
in
a
very
bad
and
what
about
your
it
would
kill
one
and
what
sort
of
life
would
it
be
for
a
girl
with
a
your
mother
in
and
you
all
my
you
and
sonya
ought
to
understand
nicholas
remained
it
comforted
him
to
hear
these
the
it
is
he
rejoined
with
a
after
a
short
would
the
princess
have
and
she
is
now
in
how
can
one
think
of
you
suppose
going
to
get
you
married
at
there
is
always
a
right
way
of
doing
replied
the
a
matchmaker
you
said
kissing
her
plump
little
chapter
vi
on
reaching
moscow
after
her
meeting
with
princess
mary
had
found
her
nephew
there
with
his
and
a
letter
from
prince
andrew
giving
her
instructions
how
to
get
to
her
aunt
malvintseva
at
that
feeling
akin
to
temptation
which
had
tormented
her
during
her
since
his
and
especially
since
her
meeting
with
rostov
was
smothered
by
arrangements
for
the
anxiety
about
her
settling
in
a
new
meeting
new
and
attending
to
her
she
was
after
a
month
passed
in
quiet
she
felt
more
and
more
deeply
the
loss
of
her
father
which
was
associated
in
her
mind
with
the
ruin
of
she
was
agitated
and
incessantly
tortured
by
the
thought
of
the
dangers
to
which
her
the
only
intimate
person
now
remaining
to
was
she
was
worried
too
about
her
education
for
which
she
had
always
felt
herself
but
in
the
depths
of
her
soul
she
felt
at
peace
arising
from
consciousness
of
having
stifled
those
personal
dreams
and
hopes
that
had
been
on
the
point
of
awakening
within
her
and
were
related
to
her
meeting
with
the
day
after
her
party
the
wife
came
to
see
malvintseva
after
discussing
her
plan
with
the
remarked
that
though
under
present
circumstances
a
formal
betrothal
of
not
to
be
thought
all
the
same
the
young
people
might
be
brought
together
and
could
get
to
know
one
malvintseva
expressed
and
the
wife
began
to
speak
of
rostov
in
praising
him
and
telling
how
he
had
blushed
when
princess
name
was
but
princess
mary
experienced
a
painful
rather
than
a
joyful
mental
tranquillity
was
and
and
hopes
during
the
two
days
that
elapsed
before
rostov
princess
mary
continually
thought
of
how
she
ought
to
behave
to
first
she
decided
not
to
come
to
the
drawing
room
when
he
called
to
see
her
it
would
not
be
proper
for
in
her
deep
to
receive
then
she
thought
this
would
be
rude
after
what
he
had
done
for
then
it
occurred
to
her
that
her
aunt
and
the
wife
had
intentions
concerning
herself
and
looks
and
words
at
times
seemed
to
confirm
this
she
told
herself
that
only
with
her
sinful
could
think
this
of
they
could
not
forget
that
situated
as
she
while
still
wearing
deep
such
matchmaking
would
be
an
insult
to
her
and
to
her
assuming
that
she
did
go
down
to
see
princess
mary
imagined
the
words
he
would
say
to
her
and
what
she
would
say
to
and
these
words
sometimes
seemed
undeservedly
cold
and
then
to
mean
too
more
than
anything
she
feared
lest
the
confusion
she
felt
might
overwhelm
her
and
betray
her
as
soon
as
she
saw
but
when
on
sunday
after
church
the
footman
announced
in
the
drawing
room
that
count
rostov
had
the
princess
showed
no
only
a
slight
blush
suffused
her
cheeks
and
her
eyes
lit
up
with
a
new
and
radiant
have
met
said
she
in
a
calm
unable
herself
to
understand
that
she
could
be
outwardly
so
calm
and
when
rostov
entered
the
the
princess
dropped
her
eyes
for
an
as
if
to
give
the
visitor
time
to
greet
her
and
then
just
as
nicholas
turned
to
her
she
raised
her
head
and
met
his
look
with
shining
with
a
movement
full
of
dignity
and
grace
she
half
rose
with
a
smile
of
held
out
her
delicate
hand
to
and
began
to
speak
in
a
voice
in
which
for
the
first
time
new
deep
womanly
notes
mademoiselle
who
was
in
the
drawing
looked
at
princess
mary
in
bewildered
herself
a
consummate
she
could
not
have
maneuvered
better
on
meeting
a
man
she
wished
to
black
is
particularly
becoming
to
her
or
she
really
has
greatly
improved
without
my
having
noticed
and
above
what
tact
and
thought
mademoiselle
had
princess
mary
been
capable
of
reflection
at
that
she
would
have
been
more
surprised
than
mademoiselle
bourienne
at
the
change
that
had
taken
place
in
from
the
moment
she
recognized
that
loved
a
new
life
force
took
possession
of
her
and
compelled
her
to
speak
and
act
apart
from
her
own
from
the
time
rostov
her
face
became
suddenly
it
was
as
if
a
light
had
been
kindled
in
a
carved
and
painted
lantern
and
the
artistic
work
on
its
that
previously
seemed
and
was
suddenly
shown
up
in
unexpected
and
striking
for
the
first
time
all
that
inward
travail
through
which
she
had
lived
appeared
on
the
all
her
inward
her
dissatisfaction
with
her
her
strivings
after
her
and
this
now
shone
in
those
radiant
in
her
delicate
and
in
every
trait
of
her
gentle
rostov
saw
all
this
as
clearly
as
if
he
had
known
her
whole
he
felt
that
the
being
before
him
was
quite
different
and
better
anyone
he
had
met
and
above
all
better
than
their
conversation
was
very
simple
and
they
spoke
of
the
and
like
everyone
else
unconsciously
exaggerated
their
sorrow
about
they
spoke
of
their
last
trying
to
change
the
talked
of
the
kind
of
and
of
princess
she
did
not
talk
about
her
diverting
the
conversation
as
soon
as
her
aunt
mentioned
evidently
she
could
speak
of
misfortunes
with
a
certain
but
her
brother
was
too
near
her
heart
and
she
neither
could
nor
would
speak
lightly
of
nicholas
noticed
as
he
noticed
every
shade
of
princess
character
with
an
observation
unusual
to
and
everything
confirmed
his
conviction
that
she
was
a
quite
unusual
and
extraordinary
nicholas
blushed
and
was
confused
when
people
spoke
to
him
about
the
princess
she
did
when
he
was
and
even
when
he
thought
of
but
in
her
presence
he
felt
quite
at
and
said
not
at
all
what
he
had
but
quite
occurred
to
him
at
the
when
a
pause
occurred
during
his
short
as
is
usual
when
there
are
turned
to
prince
little
caressing
him
and
asking
whether
he
would
like
to
be
an
he
took
the
boy
on
his
played
with
and
looked
round
at
princess
with
a
timid
look
she
watched
the
boy
she
loved
in
the
arms
of
the
man
she
nicholas
also
noticed
that
look
as
if
understanding
flushed
with
pleasure
and
began
to
kiss
the
boy
with
good
natured
as
she
was
in
mourning
princess
mary
did
not
go
out
into
and
nicholas
did
not
think
it
the
proper
thing
to
visit
her
but
all
the
same
the
wife
went
on
with
her
passing
on
to
nicholas
the
flattering
things
princess
mary
said
of
him
and
vice
and
insisting
on
his
declaring
himself
to
princess
for
this
purpose
she
arranged
a
meeting
between
the
young
people
at
the
house
before
though
rostov
told
the
wife
that
he
would
not
make
any
declaration
to
princess
he
promised
to
as
at
tilsit
rostov
had
not
allowed
himself
to
doubt
that
what
everybody
considered
right
was
so
after
a
short
but
sincere
struggle
between
his
effort
to
arrange
his
life
by
his
own
sense
of
and
in
obedient
submission
to
he
chose
the
latter
and
yielded
to
the
power
he
felt
irresistibly
carrying
him
he
knew
not
he
knew
that
after
his
promise
to
sonya
it
would
be
what
he
deemed
base
to
declare
his
feelings
to
princess
and
he
knew
that
he
would
never
act
but
he
also
knew
rather
felt
at
the
bottom
of
his
that
by
resigning
himself
now
to
the
force
of
circumstances
and
to
those
who
were
guiding
he
was
not
only
doing
nothing
but
was
doing
something
very
important
than
anything
he
had
ever
done
in
his
after
meeting
princess
though
the
course
of
his
life
went
on
externally
as
all
his
former
amusements
lost
their
charm
for
him
and
he
often
thought
about
but
he
never
thought
about
her
as
he
had
thought
of
all
the
young
ladies
without
exception
whom
he
had
met
in
nor
as
he
had
for
a
long
and
at
one
time
thought
about
he
had
pictured
each
of
those
young
ladies
as
almost
all
young
men
that
as
a
possible
adapting
her
in
his
imagination
to
all
the
conditions
of
married
a
white
dressing
his
wife
at
the
tea
his
little
mamma
and
their
relations
to
and
so
these
pictures
of
the
future
had
given
him
but
with
princess
to
whom
they
were
trying
to
get
him
he
could
never
picture
anything
of
future
married
if
he
his
pictures
seemed
incongruous
and
it
made
him
chapter
vii
the
dreadful
news
of
the
battle
of
of
our
losses
in
killed
and
and
the
still
more
terrible
news
of
the
loss
of
moscow
reached
voronezh
in
the
middle
of
princess
having
learned
of
her
wound
only
from
the
gazette
and
having
no
definite
news
of
prepared
nicholas
he
had
not
seen
her
again
to
set
off
in
search
of
prince
when
he
received
the
news
of
the
battle
of
borodino
and
the
abandonment
of
rostov
was
not
seized
with
the
desire
for
or
any
feeling
of
that
but
everything
in
voronezh
suddenly
seemed
to
him
dull
and
and
he
experienced
an
indefinite
feeling
of
shame
and
the
conversations
he
heard
seemed
to
him
he
did
not
know
how
to
judge
all
these
affairs
and
felt
that
only
in
the
regiment
would
everything
again
become
clear
to
he
made
haste
to
finish
buying
the
and
often
became
unreasonably
angry
with
his
servant
and
squadron
a
few
days
before
his
departure
a
special
at
which
nicholas
was
was
held
in
the
cathedral
for
the
russian
he
stood
a
little
behind
the
governor
and
held
himself
with
military
decorum
through
the
meditating
on
a
great
variety
of
when
the
service
was
over
the
wife
beckoned
him
to
you
seen
the
she
indicating
with
a
movement
of
her
head
a
lady
standing
on
the
opposite
beyond
the
nicholas
immediately
recognized
princess
mary
not
so
much
by
the
profile
he
saw
under
her
bonnet
as
by
the
feeling
of
and
pity
that
immediately
overcame
princess
evidently
engrossed
by
her
was
crossing
herself
for
the
last
time
before
leaving
the
nicholas
looked
at
her
face
with
it
was
the
same
face
he
had
seen
there
was
the
same
general
expression
of
spiritual
but
now
it
was
quite
differently
lit
there
was
a
pathetic
expression
of
and
hope
in
as
had
occurred
before
when
she
was
nicholas
went
up
to
her
without
waiting
to
be
prompted
by
the
wife
and
not
asking
himself
whether
or
not
it
was
right
and
proper
to
address
her
here
in
and
told
her
he
had
heard
of
her
trouble
and
sympathized
with
his
whole
as
soon
as
she
heard
his
voice
a
vivid
glow
kindled
in
her
lighting
up
both
her
sorrow
and
her
is
one
thing
i
wanted
to
tell
said
is
that
if
your
prince
andrew
were
not
it
would
have
been
at
once
announced
in
the
as
he
is
a
the
princess
looked
at
not
grasping
what
he
was
but
cheered
by
the
expression
of
regretful
sympathy
on
his
i
have
known
so
many
cases
of
a
splinter
gazette
said
it
was
a
proving
fatal
at
once
or
being
very
continued
must
hope
for
the
and
i
am
princess
mary
interrupted
that
would
be
so
she
began
prevented
by
agitation
from
she
bent
her
head
with
a
movement
as
graceful
as
everything
she
did
in
his
presence
looking
up
at
him
went
following
her
that
evening
nicholas
did
not
go
but
stayed
at
home
to
settle
some
accounts
with
the
horse
when
he
had
finished
that
business
it
was
already
too
late
to
go
anywhere
but
still
too
early
to
go
to
and
for
a
long
time
he
paced
up
and
down
the
reflecting
on
his
a
thing
he
rarely
princess
mary
had
made
an
agreeable
impression
on
him
when
he
had
met
her
in
smolensk
his
having
encountered
her
in
such
exceptional
and
his
mother
having
at
one
time
mentioned
her
to
him
as
a
good
had
drawn
his
particular
attention
to
when
he
met
her
again
in
voronezh
the
impression
she
made
on
him
was
not
merely
pleasing
but
nicholas
had
been
struck
by
the
peculiar
moral
beauty
he
observed
in
her
at
this
he
preparing
to
go
away
and
it
had
not
entered
his
head
to
regret
that
he
was
thus
depriving
himself
of
chances
of
meeting
but
that
encounter
in
church
he
sunk
deeper
than
was
desirable
for
his
peace
of
that
refined
that
radiant
those
gentle
graceful
and
especially
the
deep
and
tender
sorrow
expressed
in
all
her
features
agitated
him
and
evoked
his
in
men
rostov
could
not
bear
to
see
the
expression
of
a
higher
spiritual
life
was
why
he
did
not
like
prince
and
he
referred
to
it
contemptuously
as
philosophy
and
but
in
princess
mary
that
very
sorrow
which
revealed
the
depth
of
a
whole
spiritual
world
foreign
to
him
was
an
irresistible
must
be
a
wonderful
a
real
he
said
to
am
i
not
why
was
i
in
such
a
hurry
with
and
he
involuntarily
compared
the
the
lack
of
spirituality
in
the
one
and
the
abundance
of
it
in
the
spirituality
he
himself
lacked
and
therefore
valued
most
he
tried
to
picture
what
would
happen
were
he
how
he
would
propose
to
her
and
how
she
would
become
his
but
he
could
not
imagine
he
felt
and
no
clear
picture
presented
itself
to
his
he
had
long
ago
pictured
to
himself
a
future
with
and
that
was
all
clear
and
simple
just
because
it
had
all
been
thought
out
and
he
knew
all
there
was
in
but
it
was
impossible
to
picture
a
future
with
princess
because
he
did
not
understand
her
but
simply
loved
reveries
about
sonya
had
had
something
merry
and
playful
in
but
to
dream
of
princess
mary
was
always
difficult
and
a
little
she
he
was
plain
that
her
whole
soul
was
in
her
that
was
the
prayer
that
moves
and
i
am
sure
her
prayer
will
be
why
i
pray
for
what
i
he
suddenly
do
i
to
be
released
from
she
was
he
remembering
what
the
wife
had
but
misfortune
can
come
of
marrying
grief
for
business
terrible
i
love
as
i
release
me
from
this
inextricable
he
suddenly
began
to
prayer
can
move
but
one
must
have
faith
and
not
pray
as
natasha
and
i
used
to
as
that
the
snow
might
turn
into
and
then
run
out
into
the
yard
to
see
whether
it
had
done
but
i
am
not
praying
for
trifles
he
thought
as
he
put
his
pipe
down
in
a
and
folding
his
hands
placed
himself
before
the
softened
by
memories
of
princess
mary
he
began
to
pray
as
he
had
not
done
for
a
long
tears
were
in
his
eyes
and
in
his
throat
when
the
door
opened
and
lavrushka
came
in
with
some
why
do
you
come
in
without
being
cried
quickly
changing
his
the
said
lavrushka
in
a
sleepy
courier
has
arrived
and
a
letter
for
all
you
can
nicholas
took
the
two
one
of
which
was
from
his
mother
and
the
other
from
he
recognized
them
by
the
handwriting
and
opened
he
had
read
only
a
few
lines
when
he
turned
pale
and
his
eyes
opened
wide
with
fear
and
not
he
cried
unable
to
sit
still
he
paced
up
and
down
the
room
holding
the
letter
and
reading
he
glanced
through
then
read
it
and
then
and
standing
still
in
the
middle
of
the
room
he
raised
his
stretching
out
his
with
his
mouth
wide
open
and
his
eyes
what
he
had
just
been
praying
for
with
confidence
that
god
would
hear
him
had
come
to
but
nicholas
was
as
much
astonished
as
if
it
were
something
extraordinary
and
and
as
if
the
very
fact
that
it
had
happened
so
quickly
proved
that
it
had
not
come
from
god
to
whom
he
had
but
by
some
ordinary
this
unexpected
as
it
seemed
to
quite
voluntary
letter
from
sonya
freed
him
from
the
knot
that
fettered
him
and
from
which
there
had
seemed
no
she
wrote
that
the
last
unfortunate
the
loss
of
almost
the
whole
of
the
moscow
the
repeatedly
expressed
wish
that
nicholas
should
marry
princess
together
with
his
silence
and
coldness
of
had
all
combined
to
make
her
decide
to
release
him
from
his
promise
and
set
him
completely
it
would
be
too
painful
to
me
to
think
that
i
might
be
a
cause
of
sorrow
or
discord
in
the
family
that
has
been
so
good
to
me
and
my
love
has
no
aim
but
the
happiness
of
those
i
i
beg
you
to
consider
yourself
and
to
be
assured
in
spite
of
no
one
can
love
you
more
than
does
your
sonya
both
letters
were
written
from
the
from
the
described
their
last
days
in
their
the
and
the
destruction
of
all
their
in
this
letter
the
countess
also
mentioned
that
prince
andrew
was
among
the
wounded
traveling
with
his
state
was
very
but
the
doctor
said
there
was
now
more
sonya
and
natasha
were
nursing
next
day
nicholas
took
his
letter
and
went
to
see
princess
neither
he
nor
she
said
a
word
about
what
nursing
might
but
thanks
to
this
letter
nicholas
suddenly
became
almost
as
intimate
with
the
princess
as
if
they
were
the
following
day
he
saw
princess
mary
off
on
her
journey
to
and
a
few
days
later
left
to
rejoin
his
chapter
viii
letter
written
from
which
had
come
as
an
answer
to
was
prompted
by
the
thought
of
getting
nicholas
married
to
an
heiress
occupied
the
old
mind
more
and
she
knew
that
sonya
was
the
chief
obstacle
to
this
and
life
in
the
house
had
grown
harder
and
especially
after
they
had
received
a
letter
from
nicholas
telling
of
his
meeting
with
princess
mary
in
the
countess
let
no
occasion
slip
of
making
humiliating
or
cruel
allusions
to
but
a
few
days
before
they
left
moved
and
excited
by
all
that
was
going
she
called
sonya
to
her
instead
of
reproaching
and
making
demands
on
tearfully
implored
her
to
sacrifice
herself
and
repay
all
that
the
family
had
done
for
her
by
breaking
off
her
engagement
with
shall
not
be
at
peace
till
you
promise
me
sonya
burst
into
hysterical
tears
and
replied
through
her
sobs
that
she
would
do
anything
and
was
prepared
for
but
gave
no
actual
promise
and
could
not
bring
herself
to
decide
to
do
what
was
demanded
of
she
must
sacrifice
herself
for
the
family
that
had
reared
and
brought
her
to
sacrifice
herself
for
others
was
her
position
in
the
house
was
such
that
only
by
sacrifice
could
she
show
her
and
she
was
accustomed
to
this
and
loved
doing
but
in
all
her
former
acts
of
she
had
been
happily
conscious
that
they
raised
her
in
her
own
esteem
and
in
that
of
and
so
made
her
more
worthy
of
nicholas
whom
she
loved
more
than
anything
in
the
but
now
they
wanted
her
to
sacrifice
the
very
thing
that
constituted
the
whole
reward
for
her
and
the
whole
meaning
of
her
and
for
the
first
time
she
felt
bitterness
against
those
who
had
been
her
benefactors
only
to
torture
her
the
more
she
felt
jealous
of
natasha
who
had
never
experienced
anything
of
this
had
never
needed
to
sacrifice
but
made
others
sacrifice
themselves
for
her
and
yet
was
beloved
by
and
for
the
first
time
sonya
felt
that
out
of
her
quiet
love
for
nicholas
a
passionate
feeling
was
beginning
to
grow
up
which
was
stronger
than
or
under
the
influence
of
this
feeling
whose
life
of
dependence
had
taught
her
involuntarily
to
be
having
answered
the
countess
in
vague
general
avoided
talking
with
her
and
resolved
to
wait
till
she
should
see
not
in
order
to
set
him
free
but
on
the
contrary
at
that
meeting
to
bind
him
to
her
the
bustle
and
terror
of
the
last
days
in
moscow
stifled
the
gloomy
thoughts
that
oppressed
she
was
glad
to
find
escape
from
them
in
practical
but
when
she
heard
of
prince
presence
in
their
despite
her
sincere
pity
for
him
and
for
she
was
seized
by
a
joyful
and
superstitious
feeling
that
god
did
not
intend
her
to
be
separated
from
she
knew
that
natasha
loved
no
one
but
prince
andrew
and
had
never
ceased
to
love
she
knew
that
being
thrown
together
again
under
such
terrible
circumstances
they
would
again
fall
in
love
with
one
and
that
nicholas
would
then
not
be
able
to
marry
princess
mary
as
they
would
be
within
the
prohibited
degrees
of
despite
all
the
terror
of
what
had
happened
during
those
last
days
and
during
the
first
days
of
their
this
feeling
that
providence
was
intervening
in
her
personal
affairs
cheered
at
the
troitsa
monastery
the
rostovs
first
broke
their
journey
for
a
whole
three
large
rooms
were
assigned
to
them
in
the
monastery
one
of
which
was
occupied
by
prince
the
wounded
man
was
much
better
that
day
and
natasha
was
sitting
with
in
the
next
room
sat
the
count
and
countess
respectfully
conversing
with
the
who
was
calling
on
them
as
old
acquaintances
and
benefactors
of
the
sonya
was
there
tormented
by
curiosity
as
to
what
prince
andrew
and
natasha
were
talking
she
heard
the
sound
of
their
voices
through
the
that
door
opened
and
natasha
came
looking
not
noticing
the
who
had
risen
to
greet
her
and
was
drawing
back
the
wide
sleeve
on
his
right
she
went
up
to
sonya
and
took
her
what
are
you
come
said
the
natasha
went
up
to
the
monk
for
his
and
he
advised
her
to
pray
for
aid
to
god
and
his
as
soon
as
the
prior
natasha
took
her
friend
by
the
hand
and
went
with
her
into
the
unoccupied
will
he
she
how
happy
i
and
how
everything
is
as
it
used
to
if
only
he
he
and
natasha
burst
into
i
knew
thank
murmured
will
sonya
was
not
less
agitated
than
her
friend
by
the
fear
and
grief
and
by
her
own
personal
feelings
which
she
shared
with
no
she
kissed
and
comforted
only
he
she
having
and
wiped
away
their
the
two
friends
went
together
to
prince
natasha
opened
it
cautiously
and
glanced
into
the
sonya
standing
beside
her
at
the
prince
andrew
was
lying
raised
high
on
three
his
pale
face
was
his
eyes
and
they
could
see
his
regular
sonya
suddenly
almost
catching
her
arm
and
stepping
back
from
the
what
is
asked
said
with
a
white
face
and
trembling
natasha
softly
closed
the
door
and
went
with
sonya
to
the
not
yet
understanding
what
the
latter
was
telling
said
sonya
with
a
solemn
and
frightened
remember
when
i
looked
in
the
mirror
for
at
otradnoe
at
do
you
remember
what
i
cried
natasha
opening
her
eyes
and
vaguely
recalling
that
sonya
had
told
her
something
about
prince
andrew
whom
she
had
seen
lying
sonya
went
saw
it
then
and
told
you
and
i
saw
him
lying
on
a
said
making
a
gesture
with
her
hand
and
a
lifted
finger
at
each
that
he
had
his
eyes
closed
and
was
covered
just
with
a
pink
and
that
his
hands
were
she
convincing
herself
that
the
details
she
had
just
seen
were
exactly
what
she
had
seen
in
the
she
had
in
fact
seen
nothing
then
but
had
mentioned
the
first
thing
that
came
into
her
but
what
she
had
invented
then
seemed
to
her
now
as
real
as
any
other
she
not
only
remembered
what
she
had
then
he
turned
to
look
at
her
and
smiled
and
was
covered
with
something
was
firmly
convinced
that
she
had
then
seen
and
said
that
he
was
covered
with
a
pink
quilt
and
that
his
eyes
were
it
really
was
cried
who
now
thought
she
too
remembered
the
word
pink
being
and
saw
in
this
the
most
extraordinary
and
mysterious
part
of
the
what
does
it
she
added
i
it
is
all
so
replied
clutching
at
her
a
few
minutes
later
prince
andrew
rang
and
natasha
went
to
but
feeling
unusually
excited
and
remained
at
the
window
thinking
about
the
strangeness
of
what
had
they
had
an
opportunity
that
day
to
send
letters
to
the
and
the
countess
was
writing
to
her
said
the
raising
her
eyes
from
her
letter
as
her
niece
you
write
to
she
spoke
in
a
tremulous
and
in
the
weary
eyes
that
looked
over
her
spectacles
sonya
read
all
that
the
countess
meant
to
convey
with
these
those
eyes
expressed
shame
at
having
to
fear
of
a
and
readiness
for
relentless
hatred
in
case
of
such
sonya
went
up
to
the
countess
kneeling
kissed
her
i
will
said
sonya
was
and
touched
by
all
that
had
occurred
that
especially
by
the
mysterious
fulfillment
she
had
just
seen
of
her
now
that
she
knew
that
the
renewal
of
relations
with
prince
andrew
would
prevent
nicholas
from
marrying
princess
she
was
joyfully
conscious
of
a
return
of
that
spirit
in
which
she
was
accustomed
to
live
and
loved
to
so
with
a
joyful
consciousness
of
performing
a
magnanimous
several
times
by
the
tears
that
dimmed
her
velvety
black
wrote
that
touching
letter
the
arrival
of
which
had
so
amazed
chapter
ix
the
officer
and
soldiers
who
had
arrested
pierre
treated
him
with
hostility
but
yet
with
in
the
guardhouse
to
which
he
was
in
their
attitude
toward
him
could
still
be
felt
both
uncertainty
as
to
who
he
might
a
very
important
hostility
as
a
result
of
their
recent
personal
conflict
with
but
when
the
guard
was
relieved
next
pierre
felt
that
for
the
new
officers
and
was
not
as
interesting
as
he
had
been
to
his
and
in
fact
the
guard
of
the
second
day
did
not
recognize
in
this
stout
man
in
a
peasant
coat
the
vigorous
person
who
had
fought
so
desperately
with
the
marauder
and
the
convoy
and
had
uttered
those
solemn
words
about
saving
a
they
saw
in
him
only
17
of
the
captured
arrested
and
detained
for
some
reason
by
order
of
the
higher
if
they
noticed
anything
remarkable
about
it
was
only
his
meditative
concentration
and
and
the
way
he
spoke
which
struck
them
as
surprisingly
in
spite
of
this
he
was
placed
that
day
with
the
other
arrested
as
the
separate
room
he
had
occupied
was
required
by
an
all
the
russians
confined
with
pierre
were
men
of
the
lowest
class
recognizing
him
as
a
they
all
avoided
more
especially
as
he
spoke
pierre
felt
sad
at
hearing
them
making
fun
of
that
evening
he
learned
that
all
these
prisoners
among
were
to
be
tried
for
on
the
third
day
he
was
taken
with
the
others
to
a
house
where
a
french
general
with
a
white
mustache
sat
with
two
colonels
and
other
frenchmen
with
scarves
on
their
with
the
precision
and
definiteness
customary
in
addressing
and
which
is
supposed
to
preclude
human
pierre
like
the
others
was
questioned
as
to
who
he
where
he
had
with
what
and
so
these
like
questions
put
at
trials
left
the
essence
of
the
matter
shut
out
the
possibility
of
that
being
and
were
designed
only
to
form
a
channel
through
which
the
judges
wished
the
answers
of
the
accused
to
flow
so
as
to
lead
to
the
desired
namely
a
as
soon
as
pierre
began
to
say
anything
that
did
not
fit
in
with
that
the
channel
was
removed
and
the
water
could
flow
to
pierre
what
the
accused
always
feel
at
their
perplexity
as
to
why
these
questions
were
put
to
he
had
a
feeling
that
it
was
only
out
of
condescension
or
a
kind
of
civility
that
this
device
of
placing
a
channel
was
he
knew
he
was
in
these
that
only
by
force
had
they
brought
him
that
force
alone
gave
them
the
right
to
demand
answers
to
their
and
that
the
sole
object
of
that
assembly
was
to
inculpate
and
as
they
had
the
power
and
wish
to
inculpate
this
expedient
of
an
inquiry
and
trial
seemed
it
was
evident
that
any
answer
would
lead
to
when
asked
what
he
was
doing
when
he
was
pierre
replied
in
a
rather
tragic
manner
that
he
was
restoring
to
its
parents
a
child
he
had
saved
from
the
why
had
he
fought
the
pierre
answered
that
he
protecting
a
and
that
protect
a
woman
who
was
being
insulted
was
the
duty
of
every
they
interrupted
for
this
was
not
to
the
why
was
he
in
the
yard
of
a
burning
house
where
witnesses
had
seen
he
replied
that
he
had
gone
out
to
see
what
was
happening
in
again
they
interrupted
they
had
not
asked
where
he
was
but
why
he
was
found
near
the
who
was
they
repeating
their
first
which
he
had
declined
to
again
he
replied
that
he
could
not
answer
that
very
sternly
remarked
the
general
with
the
white
mustache
and
red
flushed
on
the
fourth
day
fires
broke
out
on
the
zubovski
pierre
and
thirteen
others
were
moved
to
the
coach
house
of
a
house
near
the
crimean
on
his
way
through
the
streets
pierre
felt
stifled
by
the
smoke
which
seemed
to
hang
over
the
whole
fires
were
visible
on
all
he
did
not
then
realize
the
significance
of
the
burning
of
and
looked
at
the
fires
with
he
passed
four
days
in
the
coach
house
near
the
crimean
bridge
and
during
that
time
from
the
talk
of
the
french
that
all
those
confined
there
were
awaiting
a
decision
which
might
come
any
day
from
the
what
marshal
this
pierre
could
not
learn
from
the
evidently
for
them
represented
a
very
high
and
rather
mysterious
these
first
before
the
eighth
of
september
when
the
prisoners
were
had
up
for
a
second
were
the
hardest
of
all
for
chapter
x
on
the
eighth
of
september
an
very
important
one
judging
by
the
respect
the
guards
showed
the
coach
house
where
the
prisoners
this
probably
someone
on
the
was
holding
a
paper
in
his
and
called
over
all
the
russians
naming
pierre
as
man
who
does
not
give
his
glancing
indolently
and
indifferently
at
all
the
he
ordered
the
officer
in
charge
to
have
them
decently
dressed
and
tidied
up
before
taking
them
to
the
an
hour
later
a
squad
of
soldiers
arrived
and
pierre
with
thirteen
others
was
led
to
the
it
was
a
fine
sunny
after
and
the
air
was
unusually
the
smoke
did
not
hang
low
as
on
the
day
when
pierre
had
been
taken
from
the
guardhouse
on
the
zubovski
but
rose
through
the
pure
air
in
no
flames
were
but
columns
of
smoke
rose
on
all
and
all
moscow
as
far
as
pierre
could
see
was
one
vast
charred
on
all
sides
there
were
waste
spaces
with
only
stoves
and
chimney
stacks
still
and
here
and
there
the
blackened
walls
of
some
brick
pierre
gazed
at
the
ruins
and
did
not
recognize
districts
he
had
known
here
and
there
he
could
see
churches
that
had
not
been
the
which
was
not
gleamed
white
in
the
distance
with
its
towers
and
the
belfry
of
ivan
the
the
domes
of
the
new
convent
of
the
virgin
glittered
brightly
and
its
bells
were
ringing
particularly
these
bells
reminded
pierre
that
it
was
sunday
and
the
feast
of
the
nativity
of
the
but
there
seemed
to
be
no
one
to
celebrate
this
everywhere
were
blackened
and
the
few
russians
to
be
seen
were
tattered
and
frightened
people
who
tried
to
hide
when
they
saw
the
it
was
plain
that
the
russian
nest
was
ruined
and
but
in
place
of
the
russian
order
of
life
that
had
been
pierre
unconsciously
felt
that
a
quite
french
order
had
been
established
over
this
ruined
he
felt
this
in
the
looks
of
the
soldiers
marching
in
regular
ranks
briskly
and
were
escorting
him
and
the
other
he
felt
it
in
the
looks
of
an
important
french
official
in
a
carriage
and
pair
driven
by
a
whom
they
met
on
the
he
felt
it
in
the
merry
sounds
of
regimental
music
he
heard
from
the
left
side
of
the
and
felt
and
realized
it
especially
from
the
list
of
prisoners
the
french
officer
had
read
out
when
he
came
that
pierre
had
been
taken
by
one
set
of
soldiers
and
led
first
to
one
and
then
to
another
place
with
dozens
of
other
and
it
seemed
that
they
might
have
forgotten
or
confused
him
with
the
but
the
answers
he
had
given
when
questioned
had
come
back
to
him
in
his
designation
as
man
who
does
not
give
his
and
under
that
which
to
pierre
seemed
they
were
now
leading
him
somewhere
with
unhesitating
assurance
on
their
faces
that
he
and
all
the
other
prisoners
were
exactly
the
ones
they
wanted
and
that
they
were
being
taken
to
the
proper
pierre
felt
himself
to
be
an
insignificant
chip
fallen
among
the
wheels
of
a
machine
whose
action
he
did
not
understand
but
which
was
working
he
and
the
other
prisoners
were
taken
to
the
right
side
of
the
to
a
large
white
house
with
an
immense
garden
not
far
from
the
this
was
prince
where
pierre
had
often
been
in
other
and
as
he
learned
from
the
talk
of
the
was
now
occupied
by
the
the
duke
of
eckmuhl
they
were
taken
to
the
entrance
and
led
into
the
house
one
by
pierre
was
the
sixth
to
he
was
conducted
through
a
glass
an
and
a
which
were
familiar
to
into
a
long
low
study
at
the
door
of
which
stood
an
spectacles
on
sat
bent
over
a
table
at
the
further
end
of
the
pierre
went
close
up
to
but
evidently
consulting
a
paper
that
lay
before
did
not
look
without
raising
his
he
said
in
a
low
are
pierre
was
silent
because
he
was
incapable
of
uttering
a
to
him
davout
was
not
merely
a
french
but
a
man
notorious
for
his
looking
at
his
cold
as
he
sat
like
a
stern
schoolmaster
who
was
prepared
to
wait
awhile
for
an
pierre
felt
that
every
instant
of
delay
might
cost
him
his
but
he
did
not
know
what
to
he
did
not
venture
to
repeat
what
he
had
said
at
his
first
yet
to
disclose
his
rank
and
position
was
dangerous
and
so
he
was
but
before
he
had
decided
what
to
davout
raised
his
pushed
his
spectacles
back
on
his
screwed
up
his
and
looked
intently
at

that
he
said
in
a
measured
evidently
calculated
to
frighten
the
chill
that
had
been
running
down
back
now
seized
his
head
as
in
a
cannot
know
i
have
never
seen
is
a
russian
davout
addressing
another
general
who
was
but
whom
pierre
had
not
davout
turned
with
an
unexpected
reverberation
in
his
voice
pierre
rapidly
he
suddenly
remembering
that
davout
was
a

cannot
have
known
i
am
a
militia
officer
and
have
not
quitted
asked
proof
have
i
that
you
are
not
exclaimed
not
in
an
offended
but
in
a
pleading
davout
looked
up
and
gazed
intently
at
for
some
seconds
they
looked
at
one
and
that
look
saved
apart
from
conditions
of
war
and
that
look
established
human
relations
between
the
two
at
that
moment
an
immense
number
of
things
passed
dimly
through
both
their
and
they
realized
that
they
were
both
children
of
humanity
and
were
at
the
first
when
davout
had
only
raised
his
head
from
the
papers
where
human
affairs
and
lives
were
indicated
by
pierre
was
merely
a
and
davout
could
have
shot
him
without
burdening
his
conscience
with
an
evil
but
now
he
saw
in
him
a
human
he
reflected
for
a
can
you
show
me
that
you
are
telling
the
said
davout
pierre
remembered
and
named
him
and
his
regiment
and
the
street
where
the
house
are
not
what
you
returned
in
a
faltering
voice
pierre
began
adducing
proofs
of
the
truth
of
his
but
at
that
moment
an
adjutant
entered
and
reported
something
to
davout
brightened
up
at
the
news
the
adjutant
and
began
buttoning
up
his
it
seemed
that
he
had
quite
forgotten
when
the
adjutant
reminded
him
of
the
he
jerked
his
head
in
direction
with
a
frown
and
ordered
him
to
be
led
but
where
they
were
to
take
him
pierre
did
not
back
to
the
coach
house
or
to
the
place
of
execution
his
companions
had
pointed
out
to
him
as
they
crossed
the
he
turned
his
head
and
saw
that
the
adjutant
was
putting
another
question
to
of
replied
but
what
this
pierre
did
not
pierre
could
not
afterwards
remember
how
he
whether
it
was
or
in
which
his
faculties
were
quite
he
was
and
noticing
nothing
around
him
went
on
moving
his
legs
as
the
others
did
till
they
all
stopped
and
he
stopped
the
only
thought
in
his
mind
at
that
time
who
was
it
that
had
really
sentenced
him
to
not
the
men
on
the
commission
that
had
first
examined
one
of
them
wished
to
could
have
done
it
was
not
who
had
looked
at
him
in
so
human
a
in
another
moment
davout
would
have
realized
that
he
was
doing
but
just
then
the
adjutant
had
come
in
and
interrupted
the
had
evidently
had
no
evil
intent
though
he
might
have
refrained
from
coming
then
who
was
executing
killing
depriving
him
of
with
all
his
and
who
was
doing
and
pierre
felt
that
it
was
no
it
was
a
concurrence
of
a
system
of
some
sort
was
killing
him
of
of
annihilating
chapter
xi
from
prince
house
the
prisoners
were
led
straight
down
the
to
the
left
of
the
as
far
as
a
kitchen
garden
in
which
a
post
had
been
set
beyond
that
post
a
fresh
pit
had
been
dug
in
the
and
near
the
post
and
the
pit
a
large
crowd
stood
in
a
the
crowd
consisted
of
a
few
russians
and
many
of
soldiers
who
were
not
on
and
in
a
variety
of
to
the
right
and
left
of
the
post
stood
rows
of
french
troops
in
blue
uniforms
with
red
epaulets
and
high
boots
and
the
prisoners
were
placed
in
a
certain
according
to
the
list
was
and
were
led
to
the
several
drums
suddenly
began
to
beat
on
both
sides
of
and
at
that
sound
pierre
felt
as
if
part
of
his
soul
had
been
torn
he
lost
the
power
of
thinking
or
he
could
only
hear
and
and
he
had
only
one
that
the
frightful
thing
that
had
to
happen
should
happen
pierre
looked
round
at
his
fellow
prisoners
and
scrutinized
the
two
first
were
convicts
with
shaven
one
was
tall
and
the
other
and
with
a
flat
the
third
was
a
domestic
about
years
with
grizzled
hair
and
a
the
fourth
was
a
a
very
handsome
man
with
a
beard
and
black
the
fifth
was
a
factory
a
lad
of
eighteen
in
a
loose
pierre
heard
the
french
consulting
whether
to
shoot
them
separately
or
two
at
a
replied
the
officer
in
command
in
a
calm
there
was
a
stir
in
the
ranks
of
the
soldiers
and
it
was
evident
that
they
were
all
as
men
hurry
to
do
something
they
but
as
people
hurry
to
finish
a
necessary
but
unpleasant
and
incomprehensible
a
french
official
wearing
a
scarf
came
up
to
the
right
of
the
row
of
prisoners
and
read
out
the
sentence
in
russian
and
in
then
two
pairs
of
frenchmen
approached
the
criminals
and
at
the
command
took
the
two
convicts
who
stood
first
in
the
the
convicts
stopped
when
they
reached
the
post
while
sacks
were
being
looked
dumbly
around
as
a
wounded
beast
looks
at
an
approaching
one
crossed
himself
the
other
scratched
his
back
and
made
a
movement
of
the
lips
resembling
a
with
hurried
hands
the
soldiers
blindfolded
drawing
the
sacks
over
their
and
bound
them
to
the
twelve
sharpshooters
with
muskets
stepped
out
of
the
ranks
with
a
firm
regular
tread
and
halted
eight
paces
from
the
pierre
turned
away
to
avoid
seeing
what
was
going
to
suddenly
a
rolling
noise
was
heard
which
seemed
to
him
louder
than
the
most
terrific
and
he
looked
there
was
some
and
the
frenchmen
were
doing
something
near
the
with
pale
faces
and
trembling
two
more
prisoners
were
led
in
the
same
way
and
with
similar
these
two
glanced
vainly
at
the
onlookers
with
only
a
silent
appeal
for
protection
in
their
evidently
unable
to
understand
or
believe
what
was
going
to
happen
to
they
could
not
believe
it
because
they
alone
knew
what
their
life
meant
to
and
so
they
neither
understood
nor
believed
that
it
could
be
taken
from
again
pierre
did
not
wish
to
look
and
again
turned
but
again
the
sound
as
of
a
frightful
explosion
struck
his
and
at
the
same
moment
he
saw
and
the
scared
faces
of
the
frenchmen
who
were
again
doing
something
by
the
their
trembling
hands
impeding
one
breathing
looked
around
as
if
asking
what
it
the
same
question
was
expressed
in
all
the
looks
that
met
on
the
faces
of
all
the
russians
and
of
the
french
soldiers
and
officers
without
he
read
the
same
and
conflict
that
were
in
his
own
after
is
doing
they
are
all
suffering
as
i
who
then
is
flashed
for
an
instant
through
his
of
the
shouted
the
fifth
the
one
next
to
was
led
pierre
did
not
understand
that
he
was
that
he
and
the
rest
had
been
brought
there
only
to
witness
the
with
and
no
sense
of
joy
or
he
gazed
at
what
was
taking
the
fifth
man
was
the
factory
lad
in
the
loose
the
moment
they
laid
hands
on
him
he
sprang
aside
in
terror
and
clutched
at
shuddered
and
shook
himself
the
lad
was
unable
to
they
dragged
him
holding
him
up
under
the
and
he
when
they
got
him
to
the
post
he
grew
as
if
he
suddenly
understood
whether
he
understood
that
screaming
was
useless
or
whether
he
thought
it
incredible
that
men
should
kill
at
any
rate
he
took
his
stand
at
the
waiting
to
be
blindfolded
like
the
and
like
a
wounded
animal
looked
around
him
with
glittering
pierre
was
no
longer
able
to
turn
away
and
close
his
his
curiosity
and
like
that
of
the
whole
reached
the
highest
pitch
at
this
fifth
like
the
others
this
fifth
man
seemed
he
wrapped
his
loose
cloak
closer
and
rubbed
one
bare
foot
with
the
when
they
began
to
blindfold
him
he
himself
adjusted
the
knot
which
hurt
the
back
of
his
then
when
they
propped
him
against
the
bloodstained
he
leaned
back
not
being
comfortable
in
that
straightened
adjusted
his
and
leaned
back
again
more
pierre
did
not
take
his
eyes
from
him
and
did
not
miss
his
slightest
probably
a
word
of
command
was
given
and
was
followed
by
the
reports
of
eight
but
try
as
he
would
pierre
could
not
afterwards
remember
having
heard
the
slightest
sound
of
the
he
only
saw
how
the
workman
suddenly
sank
down
on
the
cords
that
held
how
blood
showed
itself
in
two
how
the
ropes
slackened
under
the
weight
of
the
hanging
and
how
the
workman
sat
his
head
hanging
unnaturally
and
one
leg
bent
under
pierre
ran
up
to
the
no

frightened
people
were
doing
something
around
the
the
lower
jaw
of
an
old
frenchman
with
a
thick
mustache

as
he
untied
the
the
body
the
soldiers
dragged
it
awkwardly
from
the
post
and
began
pushing
it
into
the
they
all
plainly
and
certainly
knew
that
they
were
criminals
who
must
hide
the
traces
of
their
guilt
as
quickly
as
pierre
glanced
into
the
pit
and
saw
that
the
factory
lad
was
lying
with
his
knees
close
up
to
his
head
and
one
shoulder
higher
than
the
that
shoulder
rose
and
fell
rhythmically
and
but
spadefuls
of
earth
were
already
being
thrown
over
the
whole
one
of
the
evidently
shouted
gruffly
and
angrily
at
pierre
to
go
but
pierre
did
not
understand
him
and
remained
near
the
and
no
one
drove
him
when
the
pit
had
been
filled
up
a
command
was
pierre
was
taken
back
to
his
and
the
rows
of
troops
on
both
sides
of
the
post
made
a
half
turn
and
went
past
it
at
a
measured
the
sharpshooters
with
discharged
standing
in
the
center
of
the
ran
back
to
their
places
as
the
companies
passed
pierre
gazed
now
with
dazed
eyes
at
these
sharpshooters
who
ran
in
couples
out
of
the
all
but
one
rejoined
their
this
a
young
his
face
deadly
his
shako
pushed
and
his
musket
resting
on
the
still
stood
near
the
pit
at
the
spot
from
which
he
had
he
swayed
like
a
drunken
taking
some
steps
forward
and
back
to
save
himself
from
an
noncommissioned
officer
ran
out
of
the
ranks
and
taking
him
by
the
elbow
dragged
him
to
his
the
crowd
of
russians
and
frenchmen
began
to
they
all
went
away
silently
and
with
drooping
will
teach
them
to
start
said
one
of
the
pierre
glanced
round
at
the
speaker
and
saw
that
it
was
a
soldier
who
was
trying
to
find
some
relief
after
what
had
been
but
was
not
able
to
do
without
finishing
what
he
had
begun
to
say
he
made
a
hopeless
movement
with
his
arm
and
went
chapter
xii
after
the
execution
pierre
was
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
prisoners
and
placed
alone
in
a
and
befouled
toward
evening
a
noncommissioned
officer
entered
with
two
soldiers
and
told
him
that
he
had
been
pardoned
and
would
now
go
to
the
barracks
for
the
prisoners
of
without
understanding
what
was
said
to
pierre
got
up
and
went
with
the
they
took
him
to
the
upper
end
of
the
where
there
were
some
sheds
built
of
charred
and
and
led
him
into
one
of
in
the
darkness
some
twenty
different
men
surrounded
he
looked
at
them
without
understanding
who
they
why
they
were
or
what
they
wanted
of
he
heard
what
they
but
did
not
understand
the
meaning
of
the
words
and
made
no
kind
of
deduction
from
or
application
of
he
replied
to
questions
they
put
to
but
did
not
consider
who
was
listening
to
his
nor
how
they
would
understand
he
looked
at
their
faces
and
but
they
all
seemed
to
him
equally
from
the
moment
pierre
had
witnessed
those
terrible
murders
committed
by
men
who
did
not
wish
to
commit
it
was
as
if
the
mainspring
of
his
on
which
everything
depended
and
which
made
everything
appear
had
suddenly
been
wrenched
out
and
everything
had
collapsed
into
a
heap
of
meaningless
though
he
did
not
acknowledge
it
to
his
faith
in
the
right
ordering
of
the
in
in
his
own
and
in
had
been
he
had
experienced
this
but
never
so
strongly
as
when
similar
doubts
had
assailed
him
they
had
been
the
result
of
his
own
and
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
he
had
felt
that
relief
from
his
despair
and
from
those
doubts
was
to
be
found
within
but
now
he
felt
that
the
universe
had
crumbled
before
his
eyes
and
only
meaningless
ruins
and
this
not
by
any
fault
of
his
he
felt
that
it
was
not
in
his
power
to
regain
faith
in
the
meaning
of
around
him
in
the
darkness
men
were
standing
and
evidently
something
about
him
interested
them
they
were
telling
him
something
and
asking
him
then
they
led
him
away
and
at
last
he
found
himself
in
a
corner
of
the
shed
among
men
who
were
laughing
and
talking
on
all
that
very
prince
some
voice
at
the
other
end
of
the
shed
was
with
a
strong
emphasis
on
the
word
sitting
silent
and
motionless
on
a
heap
of
straw
against
the
pierre
sometimes
opened
and
sometimes
closed
his
but
as
soon
as
he
closed
them
he
saw
before
him
the
dreadful
face
of
the
factory
especially
dreadful
because
of
its
the
faces
of
the
even
more
dreadful
because
of
their
and
he
opened
his
eyes
again
and
stared
vacantly
into
the
darkness
around
beside
him
in
a
stooping
position
sat
a
small
man
of
whose
presence
he
was
first
made
aware
by
a
strong
smell
of
perspiration
which
came
from
him
every
time
he
this
man
was
doing
something
to
his
legs
in
the
and
though
pierre
could
not
see
his
face
he
felt
that
the
man
continually
glanced
at
on
growing
used
to
the
darkness
pierre
saw
that
the
man
was
taking
off
his
leg
and
the
way
he
did
it
aroused
having
unwound
the
string
that
tied
the
band
on
one
he
carefully
coiled
it
up
and
immediately
set
to
work
on
the
other
glancing
up
at
while
one
hand
hung
up
the
first
string
the
other
was
already
unwinding
the
band
on
the
second
in
this
having
carefully
removed
the
leg
bands
by
deft
circular
motions
of
his
arm
following
one
another
the
man
hung
the
leg
bands
up
on
some
pegs
fixed
above
his
then
he
took
out
a
cut
closed
the
placed
it
under
the
head
of
his
seating
himself
clasped
his
arms
round
his
lifted
knees
and
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
latter
was
conscious
of
something
and
in
these
deft
in
the
arrangements
in
his
and
even
in
his
very
and
he
looked
at
the
man
without
taking
his
eyes
from
seen
a
lot
of
the
little
man
suddenly
and
there
was
so
much
kindliness
and
simplicity
in
his
singsong
voice
that
pierre
tried
to
but
his
jaw
trembled
and
he
felt
tears
rising
to
his
the
little
giving
pierre
no
time
to
betray
his
instantly
continued
in
the
same
pleasant
said
in
the
tender
singsong
caressing
voice
old
russian
peasant
women
an
live
for
an
how
it
my
dear
and
here
we
thank
without
among
these
there
are
good
men
as
well
as
said
and
still
he
turned
on
his
knees
with
a
supple
got
and
went
off
to
another
part
of
the
you
pierre
heard
the
same
kind
voice
saying
at
the
other
end
of
the
you
she
and
the
pushing
away
a
little
dog
that
was
jumping
up
at
returned
to
his
place
and
sat
in
his
hands
he
had
something
wrapped
in
a
eat
a
said
resuming
his
former
respectful
tone
as
he
unwrapped
and
offered
pierre
some
baked
had
soup
for
dinner
and
the
potatoes
are
pierre
had
not
eaten
all
day
and
the
smell
of
the
potatoes
seemed
extremely
pleasant
to
he
thanked
the
soldier
and
began
to
are
they
all
said
the
soldier
with
a
should
do
like
he
took
a
drew
out
his
clasp
cut
the
potato
into
two
equal
halves
on
the
palm
of
his
sprinkled
some
salt
on
it
from
the
and
handed
it
to
potatoes
are
he
said
once
some
like
pierre
thought
he
had
never
eaten
anything
that
tasted
all
said
why
did
they
shoot
those
poor
the
last
one
was
hardly
said
the
little
what
a
what
a
he
added
and
as
if
his
words
were
always
waiting
ready
in
his
mouth
and
flew
out
involuntarily
he
went
was
that
you
stayed
in
think
they
would
come
so
i
stayed
replied
how
did
they
arrest
dear
at
your
i
went
to
look
at
the
and
they
arrested
me
and
tried
me
as
an
law
put
in
the
little
have
you
been
here
pierre
asked
as
he
munched
the
last
of
the
it
was
last
sunday

took
out
of
a
hospital
in
are
you

soldier
we

had
no
never
guessed
at
do
you
feel
sad
pierre
can
one
help
my
name
is
and
the
surname
is
he
evidently
wishing
to
make
it
easier
for
pierre
to
address
call
me
in
the
how
is
one
to
help
feeling
the
mother
of
how
can
one
see
all
this
and
not
feel
but
maggot
gnaws
the
yet
dies
what
the
old
folks
used
to
tell
he
added
what
did
you
asked
said
say
things
happen
not
as
we
plan
but
as
god
he
thinking
that
he
was
repeating
what
he
had
said
and
immediately
and
have
you
a
family
and
a
so
you
have
and
a
and
your
old
are
they
still
he
and
though
it
was
too
dark
for
pierre
to
he
felt
that
a
suppressed
smile
of
kindliness
puckered
the
lips
as
he
put
these
he
seemed
grieved
that
pierre
had
no
especially
that
he
had
no
wife
for
a
for
but
none
as
dear
as
own
said
and
have
you
little
he
went
on
again
negative
answer
seemed
to
distress
and
he
hastened
to
young
folks
and
please
god
may
still
have
the
great
thing
is
to
live
in
all
the
same
pierre
could
not
help
my
dear
rejoined
decline
a
prison
or
a
he
seated
himself
more
comfortably
and
evidently
preparing
to
tell
a
long
my
dear
i
was
still
living
at
he
had
a
plenty
of
we
peasants
lived
well
and
our
house
was
one
to
thank
god
when
father
and
we
went
out
mowing
there
were
seven
of
we
lived
we
were
real
it
so
and
platon
karataev
told
a
long
story
of
how
he
had
gone
into
copse
to
take
how
he
had
been
caught
by
the
had
been
and
sent
to
serve
as
a
and
a
smile
changed
the
tone
of
his
voice
thought
it
was
a
misfortune
but
it
turned
out
a
if
it
had
not
been
for
my
my
brother
would
have
had
to
go
as
a
but
my
younger

five

only
left

had
a
little
but
god
took
her
before
i
went
as
a
i
come
home
on
leave
and
tell
you
how
it
i
look
and
see
that
they
are
living
better
than
the
yard
full
of
the
women
at
two
brothers
away
earning
and
only
michael
the
at
he
my
children
are
the
same
to
it
hurts
the
same
whichever
finger

but
if
platon

shaved
for
a
michael
would
have
had
to
called
us
all
to
him
will
you
believe
placed
us
in
front
of
the
he
here
and
bow
down
to
his

also
bow

how
it
dear
fate
looks
for
a
but
we
are
always
not
not
our
luck
is
like
water
in
a
you
pull
at
it
and
it
but
when
drawn
it
out
how
it
and
platon
shifted
his
seat
on
the
after
a
short
silence
he
i
think
you
must
be
said
and
began
rapidly
crossing
himself
and
jesus
holy
saint
frola
and
lord
jesus
holy
saint
frola
and
lord
jesus
have
mercy
on
us
and
save
he
then
bowed
to
the
got
and
sat
down
again
on
his
heap
of
the
lay
me
down
like
a
o
and
raise
me
up
like
a
he
muttered
as
he
lay
pulling
his
coat
over
prayer
was
that
you
were
asked
murmured
who
had
almost
fallen
was
i
i
was

said
what

replied
platon

must
pity
the
animals
the
now
curled
up
and
got
you
daughter
of
a
said
touching
the
dog
that
lay
at
his
and
again
turning
over
he
fell
asleep
sounds
of
crying
and
screaming
came
from
somewhere
in
the
distance
and
flames
were
visible
through
the
cracks
of
the
but
inside
it
was
quiet
and
for
a
long
time
pierre
did
not
but
lay
with
eyes
open
in
the
listening
to
the
regular
snoring
of
platon
who
lay
beside
and
he
felt
that
the
world
that
had
been
shattered
was
once
more
stirring
in
his
soul
with
a
new
beauty
and
on
new
and
unshakable
chapter
xiii
three
and
two
officials
were
confined
in
the
shed
in
which
pierre
had
been
placed
and
where
he
remained
for
four
when
pierre
remembered
them
afterwards
they
all
seemed
misty
figures
to
him
except
platon
who
always
remained
in
his
mind
a
most
vivid
and
precious
memory
and
the
personification
of
everything
and
when
pierre
saw
his
neighbor
next
morning
at
dawn
the
first
impression
of
as
of
something
was
fully
whole
a
french
overcoat
girdled
with
a
a
and
bast
his
head
was
quite
his
and
even
his
which
he
held
as
if
ever
ready
to
embrace
were
his
pleasant
smile
and
his
gentle
brown
eyes
were
also
platon
karataev
must
have
been
judging
by
his
stories
of
campaigns
he
had
been
told
as
by
an
old
he
did
not
himself
know
his
age
and
was
quite
unable
to
determine
but
his
brilliantly
strong
teeth
which
showed
in
two
unbroken
semicircles
when
he
he
often
all
sound
and
there
was
not
a
gray
hair
in
his
beard
or
on
his
and
his
whole
body
gave
an
impression
of
suppleness
and
especially
of
firmness
and
his
despite
its
rounded
had
an
expression
of
innocence
and
his
voice
was
pleasant
and
but
the
chief
peculiarity
of
his
speech
was
its
directness
and
it
was
evident
that
he
never
considered
what
he
had
said
or
was
going
to
and
consequently
the
rapidity
and
justice
of
his
intonation
had
an
irresistible
his
physical
strength
and
agility
during
the
first
days
of
his
imprisonment
were
such
that
he
seemed
not
to
know
what
fatigue
and
sickness
every
night
before
lying
he
lay
me
down
as
a
stone
and
raise
me
up
as
a
and
every
morning
on
getting
he
lay
down
and
curled
i
get
up
and
shake
and
indeed
he
only
had
to
lie
to
fall
asleep
like
a
and
he
only
had
to
shake
to
be
ready
without
a
delay
for
some
just
as
children
are
ready
to
play
directly
they
he
could
do
not
very
well
but
not
he
and
mended
he
was
always
and
only
at
night
allowed
himself
which
he
was
he
did
not
sing
like
a
trained
singer
who
knows
he
is
listened
but
like
the
evidently
giving
vent
to
the
sounds
in
the
same
way
that
one
stretches
oneself
or
walks
about
to
get
rid
of
and
the
sounds
were
always
and
almost
and
his
face
at
such
times
was
very
having
been
taken
prisoner
and
allowed
his
beard
to
he
seemed
to
have
thrown
off
all
that
had
been
forced
upon
military
and
alien
to
had
returned
to
his
former
peasant
soldier
on
shirt
outside
he
would
he
did
not
like
talking
about
his
life
as
a
though
he
did
not
and
often
mentioned
that
he
had
not
been
flogged
once
during
the
whole
of
his
army
when
he
related
anything
it
was
generally
some
old
and
evidently
precious
memory
of
his
as
he
called
his
peasant
the
of
which
his
talk
was
were
for
the
most
part
not
the
coarse
and
indecent
saws
soldiers
but
those
folk
sayings
which
taken
without
a
context
seem
so
but
when
used
appositely
suddenly
acquire
a
significance
of
profound
he
would
often
say
the
exact
opposite
of
what
he
had
said
on
a
previous
yet
both
would
be
he
liked
to
talk
and
he
talked
adorning
his
speech
with
terms
of
endearment
and
with
folk
sayings
which
pierre
thought
he
invented
but
the
chief
charm
of
his
talk
lay
in
the
fact
that
the
commonest
just
such
as
pierre
had
witnessed
without
taking
notice
of
in
a

felt

he
unconsciously

spiritual

he
would
not

called

sent
him

to
pierre
he
always
remained
what
he
had
seemed
that
first
an
eternal
personification
of
the
spirit
of
simplicity

platon
karataev
knew
nothing

seemed

by
the

of
his
would
ask
him
to

platon
could
never
recall
what
he
had
said
a
moment
just
as
he
never
could
repeat
to
pierre

words
of
his
favorite
native
and
birch
tree

my
heart
is
sick
occurred
in

when
spoken
and
not
no
meaning
could
be
got
out
of
he
did
and
could
understand
the
meaning
of
words
apart
from
their
every
word
and
action
of
his
was
the
manifestation
of
an
activity
unknown
to
which
was
his
but
his
as
he
regarded
had
no
meaning
as
a
separate
it
had
meaning
only
as
part
of
a
whole
of
which
he
was
always
his
words
and
actions
flowed
from
him
as
and
spontaneously
as

chapter
xiv
when
princess
mary
heard
from
nicholas
that
her
brother
was
with
the
rostovs
at
yaroslavl
she
at
once
prepared
to
go
in
spite
of
her
efforts
to
dissuade
not
merely
to
go
herself
but
to
take
her
nephew
with
whether
it
were
difficult
or
possible
or
she
did
not
ask
and
did
not
want
to
it
was
her
not
only
to
to
be
near
her
brother
who
was
perhaps
but
to
do
everything
possible
to
take
his
son
to
and
so
she
prepared
to
set
that
she
had
not
heard
from
prince
andrew
princess
mary
attributed
to
his
being
too
weak
to
write
or
to
his
considering
the
long
journey
too
hard
and
too
dangerous
for
her
and
his
in
a
few
days
princess
mary
was
ready
to
her
equipages
were
the
huge
family
coach
in
which
she
had
traveled
to
a
semiopen
and
a
baggage
with
her
traveled
mademoiselle
little
nicholas
and
his
her
old
three
and
a
young
footman
and
courier
her
aunt
had
sent
to
accompany
the
usual
route
through
moscow
could
not
be
thought
and
the
roundabout
way
princess
mary
was
obliged
to
take
through
and
shuya
was
very
long
as
post
horses
were
not
everywhere
very
and
near
ryazan
where
the
french
were
said
to
have
shown
themselves
was
even
during
this
difficult
journey
mademoiselle
and
princess
servants
were
astonished
at
her
energy
and
firmness
of
she
went
to
bed
later
and
rose
earlier
than
any
of
and
no
difficulties
daunted
thanks
to
her
activity
and
which
infected
her
fellow

approached
yaroslavl
by
the
end
of
the
second
the
last
days
of
her
stay
in
voronezh
had
been
the
happiest
of
her
her
love
for
rostov
no
longer
tormented
or
agitated
it
filled
her
whole
had
become
an
integral
part
of
and
she
no
longer
struggled
against
latterly
she
had
become
convinced
that
she
loved
and
was
though
she
never
said
this
definitely
to
herself
in
she
had
become
convinced
of
it
at
her
last
interview
with
when
he
had
come
to
tell
her
that
her
brother
was
with
the
not
by
a
single
word
had
nicholas
alluded
to
the
fact
that
prince
relations
with
natasha
if
he
be
but
princess
mary
saw
by
his
face
that
he
knew
and
thought
of
yet
in
spite
of
his
relation
to
and
only
remained
but
it
sometimes
seemed
to
princess
mary
that
he
was
even
glad
that
the
family
connection
between
them
allowed
him
to
express
his
friendship
more
she
knew
that
she
loved
for
the
first
and
only
time
in
her
life
and
felt
that
she
was
and
was
happy
in
regard
to
but
this
happiness
on
one
side
of
her
spiritual
nature
did
not
prevent
her
feeling
grief
for
her
brother
with
full
on
the
that
spiritual
tranquility
on
the
one
side
made
it
the
more
possible
for
her
to
give
full
play
to
her
feeling
for
her
that
feeling
was
so
strong
at
the
moment
of
leaving
voronezh
that
those
who
saw
her
as
they
looked
at
her
despairing
felt
sure
she
would
fall
ill
on
the
but
the
very
difficulties
and
preoccupations
of
the
which
she
took
so
actively
in
saved
her
for
a
while
from
her
grief
and
gave
her
as
always
happens
when
princess
mary
thought
only
of
the
journey
forgetting
its
but
as
she
approached
yaroslavl
the
thought
of
what
might
await
her
after
many
but
that
very
presented
itself
to
her
and
her
agitation
increased
to
its
utmost
the
courier
who
had
been
sent
on
in
advance
to
find
out
where
the
rostovs
were
staying
in
and
in
what
condition
prince
andrew
when
he
met
the
big
coach
just
entering
the
town
gates
was
appalled
by
the
terrible
pallor
of
the
face
that
looked
out
at
him
from
the
have
found
out
your
the
rostovs
are
staying
at
the
merchant
in
the
square
not
far
from
right
above
the
said
the
princess
mary
looked
at
him
with
frightened
not
understanding
why
he
did
not
reply
to
what
she
chiefly
wanted
to
how
was
her
mademoiselle
bourienne
put
that
question
for
is
the
she
excellency
is
staying
in
the
same
house
with
he
is
thought
princess
and
asked
in
a
low
is
servants
say
he
is
still
the
what
the
might
mean
princess
mary
did
not
but
with
an
unnoticed
glance
at
little
who
was
sitting
in
front
of
her
looking
with
pleasure
at
the
she
bowed
her
head
and
did
not
raise
it
again
till
the
heavy
shaking
and
came
to
a
the
carriage
steps
clattered
as
they
were
let
the
carriage
door
was
on
the
left
there
was
great
on
the
right
a
there
were
people
at
the
and
a
rosy
girl
with
a
large
plait
of
black
smiling
as
it
seemed
to
princess
mary
in
an
unpleasantly
affected
was
princess
mary
ran
up
the
this
said
the
with
the
same
artificial
and
the
princess
found
herself
in
the
hall
facing
an
elderly
woman
of
oriental
who
came
rapidly
to
meet
her
with
a
look
of
this
was
the
she
embraced
princess
mary
and
kissed
she
vous
aime
et
vous
connais
depuis
i
love
you
and
have
known
you
a
long
despite
her
princess
mary
realized
that
this
was
the
countess
and
that
it
was
necessary
to
say
something
to
hardly
knowing
how
she
did
she
contrived
to
utter
a
few
polite
phrases
in
french
in
the
same
tone
as
those
that
had
been
addressed
to
and
is
doctor
says
that
he
is
not
in
said
the
but
as
she
spoke
she
raised
her
eyes
with
a
and
her
gesture
conveyed
a
contradiction
of
her
is
can
i
see
asked
the
one
my
is
this
his
said
the
turning
to
little
nicholas
who
was
coming
in
with
will
be
room
for
this
is
a
big
what
a
lovely
the
countess
took
princess
mary
into
the
drawing
where
sonya
was
talking
to
mademoiselle
the
countess
caressed
the
and
the
old
count
came
in
and
welcomed
the
he
had
changed
very
much
since
princess
mary
had
last
seen
then
he
had
been
a
old
now
he
seemed
a
bewildered
while
talking
to
princess
mary
he
continually
looked
round
as
if
asking
everyone
whether
he
was
doing
the
right
after
the
destruction
of
moscow
and
of
his
thrown
out
of
his
accustomed
groove
he
seemed
to
have
lost
the
sense
of
his
own
significance
and
to
feel
that
there
was
no
longer
a
place
for
him
in
in
spite
of
her
one
desire
to
see
her
brother
as
soon
as
and
her
vexation
that
at
the
moment
when
all
she
wanted
was
to
see
him
they
should
be
trying
to
entertain
her
and
pretending
to
admire
her
the
princess
noticed
all
that
was
going
on
around
her
and
felt
the
necessity
of
for
a
to
this
new
order
of
things
which
she
had
she
knew
it
to
be
and
though
it
was
hard
for
her
she
was
not
vexed
with
these
is
my
said
the
introducing
know
princess
mary
turned
to
sonya
trying
to
stifle
the
hostile
feeling
that
arose
in
her
toward
the
she
kissed
but
she
felt
oppressed
by
the
fact
that
the
mood
of
everyone
around
her
was
so
far
from
what
was
in
her
own
is
she
asked
addressing
them
is
natasha
is
with
answered
have
sent
to
i
think
you
must
be
tears
of
vexation
showed
themselves
in
princess
she
turned
away
and
was
about
to
ask
the
countess
again
how
to
go
to
when
and
seemingly
buoyant
steps
were
heard
at
the
the
princess
looked
round
and
saw
natasha
coming
almost
that
natasha
whom
she
had
liked
so
little
at
their
meeting
in
moscow
long
but
hardly
had
the
princess
looked
at
face
before
she
realized
that
here
was
a
real
comrade
in
her
and
consequently
a
she
ran
to
meet
embraced
and
began
to
cry
on
her
as
soon
as
sitting
at
the
head
of
prince
heard
of
princess
she
softly
left
his
room
and
hastened
to
her
with
those
swift
steps
that
had
sounded
buoyant
to
princess
there
was
only
one
expression
on
her
agitated
face
when
she
ran
into
the
drawing
of
love
for
for
and
for
all
that
was
near
to
the
man
she
and
of
suffering
for
and
passionate
desire
to
give
herself
entirely
to
helping
it
was
plain
that
at
that
moment
there
was
in
heart
no
thought
of
herself
or
of
her
own
relations
with
prince
princess
with
her
acute
understood
all
this
at
the
first
glance
at
and
wept
on
her
shoulder
with
sorrowful
come
to
said
leading
her
into
the
other
princess
mary
raised
her
dried
her
and
turned
to
she
felt
that
from
her
she
would
be
able
to
understand
and
learn
she
began
her
question
but
stopped
she
felt
that
it
was
impossible
to
or
to
in
face
and
eyes
would
have
to
tell
her
all
more
clearly
and
natasha
was
gazing
at
but
seemed
afraid
and
in
doubt
whether
to
say
all
she
knew
or
she
seemed
to
feel
that
before
those
luminous
eyes
which
penetrated
into
the
very
depths
of
her
it
was
impossible
not
to
tell
the
whole
truth
which
she
and
lips
ugly
wrinkles
gathered
round
her
and
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
she
burst
into
princess
mary
but
she
still
and
in
words
she
herself
did
not
how
is
his
what
is
his
general
will
was
all
natasha
could
they
sat
a
little
while
downstairs
near
his
room
till
they
had
left
off
crying
and
were
able
to
go
to
him
with
calm
has
his
whole
illness
is
it
long
since
he
grew
when
did
this
princess
mary
natasha
told
her
that
at
first
there
had
been
danger
from
his
feverish
condition
and
the
pain
he
but
at
troitsa
that
had
passed
and
the
doctor
had
only
been
afraid
of
that
danger
had
also
when
they
reached
yaroslavl
the
wound
had
begun
to
fester
knew
all
about
such
things
as
and
the
doctor
had
said
that
the
festering
might
take
a
normal

the
doctor
had
said

fever

chapter
xv
when
natasha
opened
prince
door
with
a
familiar
movement
and
let
princess
mary
pass
into
the
room
before
the
princess
felt
the
sobs
in
her
hard
as
she
had
tried
to
prepare
and
now
tried
to
remain
she
knew
that
she
would
be
unable
to
look
at
him
without
the
princess
understood
what
natasha
had
meant
by
the
days
ago
this
suddenly
she
understood
those
words
to
mean
that
he
had
suddenly
softened
and
that
this
softening
and
gentleness
were
signs
of
approaching
as
she
stepped
to
the
door
she
already
saw
in
imagination
face
as
she
remembered
it
in
a
sympathetic
face
which
he
had
rarely
and
which
therefore
affected
her
very
she
was
sure
he
would
speak
tender
words
to
her
such
as
her
father
had
uttered
before
his
and
that
she
would
not
be
able
to
bear
it
and
would
burst
into
sobs
in
his
yet
sooner
or
later
it
had
to
and
she
went
the
sobs
rose
higher
and
higher
in
her
throat
as
she
more
and
more
clearly
distinguished
his
form
and
her
shortsighted
eyes
tried
to
make
out
his
and
then
she
saw
his
face
and
met
his
he
was
lying
in
a
dressing
gown
on
a
surrounded
by
he
was
thin
and
in
one
translucently
white
hand
he
held
a
while
with
the
other
he
stroked
the
delicate
mustache
he
had
moving
his
fingers
his
eyes
gazed
at
them
as
they
on
seeing
his
face
and
meeting
his
eyes
princess
pace
suddenly
she
felt
her
tears
dry
up
and
her
sobs
she
suddenly
felt
guilty
and
grew
timid
on
catching
the
expression
of
his
face
and
in
what
am
i
to
she
asked
and
his
stern
look
you
are
alive
and
thinking
of
the
while
in
the
deep
gaze
that
seemed
to
look
not
outwards
but
inwards
there
was
an
almost
hostile
expression
as
he
slowly
regarded
his
sister
and
he
kissed
his
holding
her
hand
in
his
as
was
their
are
how
did
you
manage
to
get
said
he
in
a
voice
as
calm
and
aloof
as
his
had
he
screamed
in
that
scream
would
not
have
struck
such
horror
into
princess
heart
as
the
tone
of
his
have
you
brought
little
he
asked
in
the
same
quiet
manner
and
with
an
obvious
effort
to
are
you
said
princess
herself
surprised
at
what
she
was
my
you
must
ask
the
he
and
again
making
an
evident
effort
to
be
he
said
with
his
lips
only
words
clearly
did
not
correspond
to
his
chere
you
for
my
princess
mary
pressed
his
the
pressure
made
him
wince
just
he
was
and
she
did
not
know
what
to
she
now
understood
what
had
happened
to
him
two
days
in
his
his
and
especially
in
that
almost
antagonistic
look
could
be
felt
an
estrangement
from
everything
belonging
to
this
terrible
in
one
who
is
evidently
only
with
an
effort
did
he
understand
anything
but
it
was
obvious
that
he
failed
to
not
because
he
lacked
the
power
to
do
so
but
because
he
understood
something
the
living
did
not
and
could
not
which
wholly
occupied
his
you
see
how
strangely
fate
has
brought
us
said
breaking
the
silence
and
pointing
to
looks
after
me
all
the
princess
mary
heard
him
and
did
not
understand
how
he
could
say
such
a
the
tender
prince
how
could
he
say
before
her
whom
he
loved
and
who
loved
had
he
expected
to
live
he
could
not
have
said
those
words
in
that
offensively
cold
if
he
had
not
known
that
he
was
how
could
he
have
failed
to
pity
her
and
how
could
he
speak
like
that
in
her
the
only
explanation
was
that
he
was
because
something
much
more
had
been
revealed
to
the
conversation
was
cold
and

of
said
prince
andrew
did
not
notice
that
she
called
his
sister
and
only
after
calling
her
so
in
his
presence
did
natasha
notice
it
he
told
her
that
all
moscow
has
been
burned
and
natasha
it
was
impossible
to
it
was
plain
that
he
was
making
an
effort
to
but
could
not
do
they
say
he
a
great
and
he
gazed
straight
before
absently
stroking
his
mustache
with
his
so
you
have
met
count
prince
andrew
suddenly
evidently
wishing
to
speak
pleasantly
to
wrote
here
that
he
took
a
great
liking
to
he
went
on
simply
and
evidently
unable
to
understand
all
the
complex
significance
his
words
had
for
living
you
liked
him
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
you
to
get
he
added
rather
more
as
if
pleased
at
having
found
words
he
had
long
been
princess
mary
heard
his
words
but
they
had
no
meaning
for
except
as
a
proof
of
how
far
away
he
now
was
from
everything
talk
of
she
said
quietly
and
glanced
at
who
felt
her
did
not
look
at
all
three
were
again
would
you
princess
mary
suddenly
said
in
a
trembling
you
like
to
see
little
he
is
always
talking
about
prince
andrew
smiled
just
perceptibly
and
for
the
first
but
princess
who
knew
his
face
so
saw
with
horror
that
he
did
not
smile
with
pleasure
or
affection
for
his
but
with
gentle
irony
because
he
thought
she
was
trying
what
she
believed
to
be
the
last
means
of
arousing
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
see
is
he
quite
when
little
nicholas
was
brought
into
prince
room
he
looked
at
his
father
with
frightened
but
did
not
because
no
one
else
was
prince
andrew
kissed
him
and
evidently
did
not
know
what
to
say
to
when
nicholas
had
been
led
princess
mary
again
went
up
to
her
kissed
and
unable
to
restrain
her
tears
any
longer
began
to
he
looked
at
her
it
about
he
princess
mary
nodded
her
you
know
the
but
he
broke
did
you
you
cry
he
looking
at
her
with
the
same
cold
when
princess
mary
began
to
he
understood
that
she
was
crying
at
the
thought
that
little
nicholas
would
be
left
without
a
with
a
great
effort
he
tried
to
return
to
life
and
to
see
things
from
their
point
of
to
them
it
must
seem
he
how
simple
it
fowls
of
the
air
sow
neither
do
they
yet
your
father
feedeth
he
said
to
himself
and
wished
to
say
to
princess
they
will
take
it
their
own
they
they
understand
that
all
those
feelings
they
prize
our
all
those
ideas
that
seem
so
important
to
are
we
cannot
understand

and
he
remained
prince
little

was
he
could
scarcely
and
knew
after
that
day
he
lived
through
many
gaining
and
but
had
he
possessed
all
the
faculties
he
afterwards
he
could
not
have
had
a
better
or
more
profound
understanding
of
the
meaning
of
the
scene
he
had
witnessed
between
his
and
than
he
had
he
understood
it
leaving
the
room
without
went
silently
up
to
natasha
who
had
come
out
with
him
and
looked
shyly
at
her
with
his
thoughtful
then
his
rosy
upper
lip
trembled
and
leaning
his
head
against
her
he
began
to
after
that
he
avoided
dessalles
and
the
countess
who
caressed
him
and
either
sat
alone
or
came
timidly
to
princess
or
to
natasha
of
whom
he
seemed
even
fonder
than
of
his
and
clung
to
them
quietly
and
when
princess
mary
had
left
prince
andrew
she
fully
understood
what
face
had
told
she
did
not
speak
any
more
to
natasha
of
hopes
of
saving
his
she
took
turns
with
her
beside
his
and
did
not
cry
any
but
prayed
turning
in
soul
to
that
eternal
and
whose
presence
above
the
dying
man
was
now
so
chapter
xvi
not
only
did
prince
andrew
know
he
would
but
he
felt
that
he
was
dying
and
was
already
half
he
was
conscious
of
an
aloofness
from
everything
earthly
and
a
strange
and
joyous
lightness
of
without
haste
or
agitation
he
awaited
what
was
that
and
unknown
the
presence
of
which
he
had
felt
continually
all
his
now
near
to
him
by
the
strange
lightness
he
almost
comprehensible
and
formerly
he
had
feared
the
he
had
twice
experienced
that
terribly
tormenting
fear
of
now
he
no
longer
understood
that
he
had
felt
it
for
the
first
time
when
the
shell
spun
like
a
top
before
and
he
looked
at
the
fallow
the
and
the
and
knew
that
he
was
face
to
face
with
when
he
came
to
himself
after
being
wounded
and
the
flower
of
unfettered
love
had
instantly
unfolded
itself
in
his
soul
as
if
freed
from
the
bondage
of
life
that
had
restrained
he
no
longer
feared
death
and
ceased
to
think
about
during
the
hours
of
and
partial
delirium
he
spent
after
he
was
the
more
deeply
he
penetrated
into
the
new
principle
of
eternal
love
revealed
to
the
more
he
unconsciously
detached
himself
from
earthly
to
love
everything
and
everybody
and
always
to
sacrifice
oneself
for
love
meant
not
to
love
not
to
live
this
earthly
and
the
more
imbued
he
became
with
that
principle
of
the
more
he
renounced
life
and
the
more
completely
he
destroyed
that
dreadful
barrier
the
absence
of
such
stands
between
life
and
when
during
those
first
days
he
remembered
that
he
would
have
to
he
said
to
what
of
so
much
the
but
after
the
night
in
mytishchi
half
he
had
seen
her
for
whom
he
longed
appear
before
him
having
pressed
her
hand
to
his
had
shed
happy
love
for
a
particular
woman
again
crept
unobserved
into
his
heart
and
once
more
bound
him
to
and
joyful
and
agitating
thoughts
began
to
occupy
his
recalling
the
moment
at
the
ambulance
station
when
he
had
seen
he
could
not
now
regain
the
feeling
he
then
but
was
tormented
by
the
question
whether
kuragin
was
and
he
dared
not
his
illness
pursued
its
normal
physical
but
what
natasha
referred
to
when
she
suddenly
had
occurred
two
days
before
princess
mary
it
was
the
last
spiritual
struggle
between
life
and
in
which
death
gained
the
it
was
the
unexpected
realization
of
the
fact
that
he
still
valued
life
as
presented
to
him
in
the
form
of
his
love
for
and
a
though
ultimately
attack
of
terror
before
the
it
was
as
usual
after
dinner
he
was
slightly
and
his
thoughts
were
preternaturally
sonya
was
sitting
by
the
he
began
to
suddenly
a
feeling
of
happiness
seized
she
has
thought
and
so
it
in
place
sat
natasha
who
had
just
come
in
since
she
had
begun
looking
after
he
had
always
experienced
this
physical
consciousness
of
her
she
was
sitting
in
an
armchair
placed
screening
the
light
of
the
candle
from
and
was
knitting
a
she
had
learned
to
knit
stockings
since
prince
andrew
had
casually
mentioned
that
no
one
nursed
the
sick
so
well
as
old
nurses
who
knit
and
that
there
is
something
soothing
in
the
knitting
of
the
needles
clicked
lightly
in
her
rapidly
moving
and
he
could
clearly
see
the
thoughtful
profile
of
her
drooping
she
and
the
ball
rolled
off
her
she
glanced
round
at
and
screening
the
candle
with
her
hand
stooped
carefully
with
a
supple
and
exact
picked
up
the
and
regained
her
former
he
looked
at
her
without
moving
and
saw
that
she
wanted
to
draw
a
deep
breath
after
but
refrained
from
doing
so
and
breathed
at
the
troitsa
monastery
they
had
spoken
of
the
and
he
had
told
her
that
if
he
lived
he
would
always
thank
god
for
his
wound
which
had
brought
them
together
but
after
that
they
never
spoke
of
the
it
or
can
it
not
he
now
thought
as
he
looked
at
her
and
listened
to
the
light
click
of
the
steel
fate
have
brought
me
to
her
so
strangely
only
for
me
to
is
it
possible
that
the
truth
of
life
has
been
revealed
to
me
only
to
show
me
that
i
have
spent
my
life
in
i
love
her
more
than
anything
in
the
but
what
am
i
to
do
if
i
love
he
and
he
involuntarily
from
a
habit
acquired
during
his
on
hearing
that
sound
natasha
put
down
the
leaned
nearer
to
and
noticing
his
shining
stepped
lightly
up
to
him
and
bent
over
are
not
i
have
been
looking
at
you
a
long
i
felt
you
come
no
one
else
gives
me
that
sense
of
soft
tranquillity
that
you
that
i
want
to
weep
for
natasha
drew
closer
to
her
face
shone
with
rapturous
i
love
you
too
more
than
anything
in
the
turned
away
for
an
too
she
too
what
do
what
do
you
feel
in
your
your
whole
i
what
do
you
am
sure
of
natasha
almost
taking
hold
of
both
his
hands
with
a
passionate
he
remained
silent
good
it
would
and
taking
her
hand
he
kissed
natasha
felt
happy
and
but
at
once
remembered
that
this
would
not
do
and
that
he
had
to
be
you
have
not
she
repressing
her
to
he
pressed
her
hand
and
released
and
she
went
back
to
the
candle
and
sat
down
again
in
her
former
twice
she
turned
and
looked
at
and
her
eyes
met
his
beaming
at
she
set
herself
a
task
on
her
stocking
and
resolved
not
to
turn
round
till
it
was
soon
he
really
shut
his
eyes
and
fell
he
did
not
sleep
long
and
suddenly
awoke
with
a
start
and
in
a
cold
as
he
fell
asleep
he
had
still
been
thinking
of
the
subject
that
now
always
occupied
his
life
and
and
chiefly
about
he
felt
himself
nearer
to
what
is
he
hinders
love
is
everything
that
i
i
understand
only
because
i
everything
everything
only
because
i
everything
is
united
by
it
love
is
and
to
die
means
that
a
particle
of
shall
return
to
the
general
and
eternal
these
thoughts
seemed
to
him
but
they
were
only
something
was
lacking
in
they
were
not
they
were
too
personal
and
and
there
was
the
former
agitation
and
he
fell
he
dreamed
that
he
was
lying
in
the
room
he
really
was
but
that
he
was
quite
well
and
many
and
insignificant
people
appeared
before
he
talked
to
them
and
discussed
something
they
were
preparing
to
go
away
prince
andrew
dimly
realized
that
all
this
was
trivial
and
that
he
had
more
important
but
he
continued
to
surprising
them
by
empty
all
these
persons
began
to
disappear
and
a
single
that
of
the
closed
superseded
all
he
rose
and
went
to
the
door
to
bolt
and
lock
everything
depended
on
whether
he
or
was
in
time
to
lock
he
and
tried
to
but
his
legs
refused
to
move
and
he
knew
he
would
not
be
in
time
to
lock
the
door
though
he
painfully
strained
all
his
he
was
seized
by
an
agonizing
and
that
fear
was
the
fear
of
it
stood
behind
the
but
just
when
he
was
clumsily
creeping
toward
the
that
dreadful
something
on
the
other
side
was
already
pressing
against
it
and
forcing
its
way
something
not
breaking
in
through
that
and
had
to
be
kept
he
seized
the
making
a
final
effort
to
hold
it
lock
it
was
no
longer
his
efforts
were
weak
and
clumsy
and
the
pushed
from
behind
by
that
opened
and
closed
once
again
it
pushed
from
his
last
superhuman
efforts
were
vain
and
both
halves
of
the
door
noiselessly
it
and
it
was
and
prince
andrew
but
at
the
instant
he
prince
andrew
remembered
that
he
was
and
at
the
very
instant
he
having
made
an
he
it
was
i
woke
death
is
an
and
all
at
once
it
grew
light
in
his
soul
and
the
veil
that
had
till
then
concealed
the
unknown
was
lifted
from
his
spiritual
he
felt
as
if
powers
till
then
confined
within
him
had
been
and
that
strange
lightness
did
not
again
leave
waking
in
a
cold
he
moved
on
the
natasha
went
up
and
asked
him
what
was
the
he
did
not
answer
and
looked
at
her
not
that
was
what
had
happened
to
him
two
days
before
princess
from
that
as
the
doctor
expressed
the
wasting
fever
assumed
a
malignant
but
what
the
doctor
said
did
not
interest
she
saw
the
terrible
moral
symptoms
which
to
her
were
more
from
that
day
an
awakening
from
life
came
to
prince
andrew
together
with
his
awakening
from
and
compared
to
the
duration
of
life
it
did
not
seem
to
him
slower
than
an
awakening
from
sleep
compared
to
the
duration
of
a
there
was
nothing
terrible
or
violent
in
this
comparatively
slow
his
last
days
and
hours
passed
in
an
ordinary
and
simple
both
princess
mary
and
who
did
not
leave
felt
they
did
not
weep
or
shudder
and
during
these
last
days
they
themselves
felt
that
they
were
not
attending
on
him
was
no
longer
he
had
left
but
on
what
reminded
them
most
closely
of
both
felt
this
so
strongly
that
the
outward
and
terrible
side
of
death
did
not
affect
them
and
they
did
not
feel
it
necessary
to
foment
their
neither
in
his
presence
nor
out
of
it
did
they
nor
did
they
ever
talk
to
one
another
about
they
felt
that
they
could
not
express
in
words
what
they
they
both
saw
that
he
was
sinking
slowly
and
deeper
and
away
from
and
they
both
knew
that
this
had
to
be
so
and
that
it
was
he
and
received
everyone
came
to
take
leave
of
when
they
brought
his
son
to
he
pressed
his
lips
to
the
and
turned
not
because
he
felt
it
hard
and
sad
mary
and
natasha
understood
but
simply
because
he
thought
it
was
all
that
was
required
of
but
when
they
told
him
to
bless
the
he
did
what
was
demanded
and
looked
round
as
if
asking
whether
there
was
anything
else
he
should
when
the
last
convulsions
of
the
which
the
spirit
was
princess
mary
and
natasha
were
it
said
princess
mary
when
his
body
had
for
a
few
minutes
lain
growing
cold
before
natasha
went
looked
at
the
dead
and
hastened
to
close
she
closed
them
but
did
not
kiss
but
clung
to
that
which
reminded
her
most
nearly
of
has
he
where
is
he
when
the
washed
and
lay
in
the
coffin
on
a
everyone
came
to
take
leave
of
him
and
they
all
little
nicholas
cried
because
his
heart
was
rent
by
painful
the
countess
and
sonya
cried
from
pity
for
natasha
and
because
he
was
no
the
old
count
cried
because
he
felt
that
before
must
take
the
same
terrible
natasha
and
princess
mary
also
wept
but
not
because
of
their
own
personal
they
wept
with
a
reverent
and
softening
emotion
which
had
taken
possession
of
their
souls
at
the
consciousness
of
the
simple
and
solemn
mystery
of
death
that
had
been
accomplished
in
their
book
1812
chapter
i
mind
cannot
grasp
the
causes
of
events
in
their
but
the
desire
to
find
those
causes
is
implanted
in
and
without
considering
the
multiplicity
and
complexity
of
the
conditions
any
one
of
which
taken
separately
may
seem
to
be
the
he
snatches
at
the
first
approximation
to
a
cause
that
seems
to
him
intelligible
and
is
the
in
historical
events
the
actions
of
men
are
the
subject
of
the
first
and
most
primitive
approximation
to
present
itself
was
the
will
of
the
gods
after
the
will
of
those
who
stood
in
the
most
prominent
heroes
of
but
we
need
only
penetrate
to
the
essence
of
any
historic
lies
in
the
activity
of
the
general
mass
of
men
who
take
part
in
be
convinced
that
the
will
of
the
historic
hero
does
not
control
the
actions
of
the
mass
but
is
itself
continually
it
may
seem
to
be
a
matter
of
indifference
whether
we
understand
the
meaning
of
historical
events
this
way
or
yet
there
is
the
same
difference
between
a
man
who
says
that
the
people
of
the
west
moved
on
the
east
because
napoleon
wished
it
and
a
man
who
says
that
this
happened
because
it
had
to
as
there
is
between
those
who
declared
that
the
earth
was
stationary
and
that
the
planets
moved
round
it
and
those
who
admitted
that
they
did
not
know
what
upheld
the
but
knew
there
were
laws
directing
its
movement
and
that
of
the
other
there
and
can
no
cause
of
an
historical
event
except
the
one
cause
of
all
but
there
are
laws
directing
and
some
of
these
laws
are
known
to
us
while
we
are
conscious
of
others
we
cannot
the
discovery
of
these
laws
is
only
possible
when
we
have
quite
abandoned
the
attempt
to
find
the
cause
in
the
will
of
some
one
just
as
the
discovery
of
the
laws
of
the
motion
of
the
planets
was
possible
only
when
men
abandoned
the
conception
of
the
fixity
of
the
the
historians
consider
next
to
the
battle
of
borodino
and
the
occupation
of
moscow
by
the
enemy
and
its
destruction
by
the
most
important
episode
of
the
war
of
1812
was
the
movement
of
the
russian
army
from
the
ryazana
to
the
kaluga
road
and
to
the
tarutino
flank
march
across
the
krasnaya
pakhra
they
ascribe
the
glory
of
that
achievement
of
genius
to
different
men
and
dispute
as
to
whom
the
honor
is
even
foreign
including
the
acknowledge
the
genius
of
the
russian
commanders
when
they
speak
of
that
flank
but
it
is
hard
to
understand
why
military
and
following
them
consider
this
flank
march
to
be
the
profound
conception
of
some
one
man
who
saved
russia
and
destroyed
in
the
first
place
it
is
hard
to
understand
where
the
profundity
and
genius
of
this
movement
for
not
much
mental
effort
was
needed
to
see
that
the
best
position
for
an
army
when
it
is
not
being
attacked
is
where
there
are
most
and
even
a
dull
boy
of
thirteen
could
have
guessed
that
the
best
position
for
an
army
after
its
retreat
from
moscow
in
1812
was
on
the
kaluga
so
it
is
impossible
to
understand
by
what
reasoning
the
historians
reach
the
conclusion
that
this
maneuver
was
a
profound
and
it
is
even
more
difficult
to
understand
just
why
they
think
that
this
maneuver
was
calculated
to
save
russia
and
destroy
the
for
this
flank
had
it
been
or
followed
by
other
might
have
proved
ruinous
to
the
russians
and
salutary
for
the
if
the
position
of
the
russian
army
really
began
to
improve
from
the
time
of
that
it
does
not
at
all
follow
that
the
march
was
the
cause
of
that
flank
march
might
not
only
have
failed
to
give
any
advantage
to
the
russian
but
might
in
other
circumstances
have
led
to
its
what
would
have
happened
had
moscow
not
burned
if
murat
had
not
lost
sight
of
the
if
napoleon
had
not
remained
if
the
russian
army
at
krasnaya
pakhra
had
given
battle
as
bennigsen
and
barclay
what
would
have
happened
had
the
french
attacked
the
russians
while
they
were
marching
beyond
the
what
would
have
happened
if
on
approaching
napoleon
had
attacked
the
russians
with
but
a
tenth
of
the
energy
he
had
shown
when
he
attacked
them
at
what
would
have
happened
had
the
french
moved
on
in
any
of
these
eventualities
the
flank
march
that
brought
salvation
might
have
proved
the
third
and
most
incomprehensible
thing
is
that
people
studying
history
deliberately
avoid
seeing
that
this
flank
march
cannot
be
attributed
to
any
one
that
no
one
ever
foresaw
and
that
in
like
the
retreat
from
it
did
not
suggest
itself
to
anyone
in
its
but
by
step
by
event
by
an
endless
number
of
most
diverse
circumstances
and
was
only
seen
in
its
entirety
when
it
had
been
accomplished
and
belonged
to
the
at
the
council
at
fili
the
prevailing
thought
in
the
minds
of
the
russian
commanders
was
the
one
naturally
suggesting
a
direct
retreat
by
the
nizhni
in
proof
of
this
there
is
the
fact
that
the
majority
of
the
council
voted
for
such
a
and
above
all
there
is
the
conversation
after
the
between
the
commander
in
chief
and
who
was
in
charge
of
the
commissariat
lanskoy
informed
the
that
the
army
supplies
were
for
the
most
part
stored
along
the
oka
in
the
tula
and
ryazan
and
that
if
they
retreated
on
nizhni
the
army
would
be
separated
from
its
supplies
by
the
broad
river
which
cannot
be
crossed
early
in
this
was
the
first
indication
of
the
necessity
of
deviating
from
what
had
previously
seemed
the
most
natural
direct
retreat
on
the
army
turned
more
to
the
along
the
ryazan
road
and
nearer
to
its
subsequently
the
inactivity
of
the
french
even
lost
sight
of
the
russian
concern
for
the
safety
of
the
arsenal
at
and
especially
the
advantages
of
drawing
nearer
to
its
supplies
caused
the
army
to
turn
still
further
south
to
the
tula
having
crossed
by
a
forced
to
the
tula
road
beyond
the
the
russian
commanders
intended
to
remain
at
podolsk
and
had
no
thought
of
the
tarutino
but
innumerable
circumstances
and
the
reappearance
of
french
troops
who
had
for
a
time
lost
touch
with
the
and
projects
of
giving
and
above
all
the
abundance
of
provisions
in
kaluga
obliged
our
army
to
turn
still
more
to
the
south
and
to
cross
from
the
tula
to
the
kaluga
road
and
go
to
which
was
between
the
roads
along
which
those
supplies
just
as
it
is
impossible
to
say
when
it
was
decided
to
abandon
so
it
is
impossible
to
say
precisely
or
by
it
was
decided
to
move
to
only
when
the
army
had
got
as
the
result
of
innumerable
and
varying
did
people
begin
to
assure
themselves
that
they
had
desired
this
movement
and
long
ago
foreseen
its
chapter
ii
the
famous
flank
movement
merely
consisted
in
after
the
advance
of
the
french
had
the
russian
which
had
been
continually
retreating
straight
back
from
the
deviated
from
that
direct
course
not
finding
itself
was
naturally
drawn
toward
the
district
where
supplies
were
if
instead
of
imagining
to
ourselves
commanders
of
genius
leading
the
russian
we
picture
that
army
without
any
it
could
not
have
done
anything
but
make
a
return
movement
toward
describing
an
arc
in
the
direction
where
most
provisions
were
to
be
found
and
where
the
country
was
that
movement
from
the
nizhni
to
the
and
kaluga
roads
was
so
natural
that
even
the
russian
marauders
moved
in
that
and
demands
were
sent
from
petersburg
for
kutuzov
to
take
his
army
that
at
tarutino
kutuzov
received
what
was
almost
a
reprimand
from
the
emperor
for
having
moved
his
army
along
the
ryazan
and
the
letter
indicated
to
him
the
very
position
he
had
already
occupied
near
having
rolled
like
a
ball
in
the
direction
of
the
impetus
given
by
the
whole
campaign
and
by
the
battle
of
the
russian
the
strength
of
that
impetus
was
exhausted
and
no
fresh
push
was
assumed
the
position
natural
to
merit
not
in
any
strategic
maneuver
of
as
it
is
but
in
the
fact
that
he
alone
understood
the
significance
of
what
had
he
alone
then
understood
the
meaning
of
the
french
he
alone
continued
to
assert
that
the
battle
of
borodino
had
been
a
he
as
might
have
been
expected
to
be
eager
to
his
whole
strength
to
restrain
the
russian
army
from
useless
the
beast
wounded
at
borodino
was
lying
where
the
fleeing
hunter
had
left
but
whether
he
was
still
whether
he
was
strong
and
merely
lying
the
hunter
did
not
suddenly
the
beast
was
heard
to
the
moan
of
that
wounded
beast
french
which
betrayed
its
calamitous
condition
was
the
sending
of
lauriston
to
camp
with
overtures
for
with
his
usual
assurance
that
whatever
entered
his
head
was
wrote
to
kutuzov
the
first
words
that
occurred
to
though
they
were
monsieur
le
prince
i
am
sending
one
of
my
to
discuss
several
interesting
questions
with
i
beg
your
highness
to
credit
what
he
says
to
especially
when
he
expresses
the
sentiment
of
esteem
and
special
regard
i
have
long
entertained
for
your
this
letter
having
no
other
i
pray
monsieur
le
prince
to
keep
you
in
his
holy
and
gracious
napoleon
october
1812
kutuzov
should
be
cursed
by
posterity
were
i
looked
on
as
the
initiator
of
a
settlement
of
any
such
is
the
present
spirit
of
my
but
he
continued
to
exert
all
his
powers
to
restrain
his
troops
from
during
the
month
that
the
french
troops
were
pillaging
in
moscow
and
the
russian
troops
were
quietly
encamped
at
a
change
had
taken
place
in
the
relative
strength
of
the
two
in
spirit
and
in
a
result
of
which
the
superiority
had
passed
to
the
russian
though
the
condition
and
numbers
of
the
french
army
were
unknown
to
the
as
soon
as
that
change
occurred
the
need
of
attacking
at
once
showed
itself
by
countless
these
signs
the
abundance
of
provisions
at
the
reports
coming
in
from
all
sides
of
the
inactivity
and
disorder
of
the
the
flow
of
recruits
to
our
the
fine
the
long
rest
the
russian
soldiers
had
and
the
impatience
to
do
what
they
had
been
assembled
which
usually
shows
itself
in
an
army
that
has
been
curiosity
as
to
what
the
french
so
long
lost
sight
was
the
boldness
with
which
our
outposts
now
scouted
close
up
to
the
french
stationed
at
the
news
of
easy
successes
gained
by
peasants
and
guerrilla
troops
over
the
the
envy
aroused
by
the
desire
for
revenge
that
lay
in
the
heart
of
every
russian
as
long
as
the
french
were
in
and
a
dim
consciousness
in
every
mind
that
the
relative
strength
of
the
armies
had
changed
and
that
the
advantage
was
now
on
our
there
was
a
substantial
change
in
the
relative
and
an
advance
had
become
and
at
as
a
clock
begins
to
strike
and
chime
as
soon
as
the
minute
hand
has
completed
a
full
this
change
was
shown
by
an
increased
and
chiming
in
the
higher
chapter
iii
the
russian
army
was
commanded
by
kutuzov
and
his
and
also
by
the
emperor
from
before
the
news
of
the
abandonment
of
moscow
had
been
received
in
a
detailed
plan
of
the
whole
campaign
had
been
drawn
up
and
sent
to
kutuzov
for
his

this
plan
had
been
drawn
up
on
the
supposition
that
moscow
was
still

approved
by
the
staff
and
accepted
as
a
basis
for
kutuzov
only
replied
that
movements
arranged
from
a
distance
were
always
difficult
to
so
fresh
instructions
were
sent
for
the
solution
of
difficulties
that
might
be
as
well
as
fresh

who
were
to
watch

by
who
had
gone

to

given
to
the
question
whether
it
would
be
better
to
put

on
the
contrary
to
put

so
if
anything
more
than
or
satisfaction
depended
on
as
a
result
of
the
hostility
between
kutuzov
and
his
chief
of
the
presence
of
confidential
representatives
of
the

more
than
usually
complicated
play
of
parties

going
on
among
the

so
on
in
all
possible
combinations
and
in
all
these
plottings
the
subject
of
intrigue
was
generally
the
conduct
of
the
which
all
these
men
believed
they
were
but
this
affair
of
the
war
went
on
independently

it

flowing
always
from

from
you
all
the

your
military
and
the
courage
of
the
troops
you
command
justify
us
in
but
by
the
time
this
which
proved
that
the
real
relation
of
the
forces
had
already
made
itself
felt
in
was
kutuzov
had
found
himself
unable
any
longer
to
restrain
the
army
he
commanded
from
attacking
and
a
battle
had
taken
on
the
second
of
october
a

was
out

and
wounded

the

one
of
the

was
acquainted

the
incident

out
beyond

still
at

heard
as
he
rode
the
merry
sounds
of
a
dance
song
proceeding
from

he
accompanied

whistling
and
the
sound
of
a
drowned
every

then
by
these
sounds
made
his
spirits
but
at
the

time
he
was
afraid
that
he
would
be
blamed
for
not
having
executed

the
important
order
entrusted
to

already

dismounted

went
up
into

of
a
large
country
house

had
remained
intact

the
footmen
were
bustling
about
with

and
groups

was
admitted
and
immediately
saw
all
the
chief
generals
of
the
army
and
among
them
big
imposing
they
all
had
their
coats
unbuttoned
and
were
standing
in
a
semicircle
with
flushed
and
animated
laughing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
a
short
handsome
general
with
a
red
face
was
dancing
the
trepak
with
much
spirit
and
nicholas
the
officer
felt
that
by
arriving
with
important
orders
at
such
a
moment
he
was
doubly
to
and
he
would
have
preferred
to
but
one
of
the
generals
espied
him
hearing
what
he
had
come
informed
ermolov
came
forward
with
a
frown
on
his
face
hearing
what
the
officer
had
to
took
the
papers
from
him
without
a

went
off

into

drove
from

village
three
and
a
half
miles
from
to
the
place
where
the
attacking
columns
were
to
he
sat
in
the
dozing
and
waking
up
by
and
listening
for
any
sound
of
firing
on
the

as
an
indication
that
the
action
had

all
was
still
a
damp
dull
autumn
morning
was
just
on
approaching

kutuzov
noticed
cavalrymen
leading
their
horses
to
water
across
the
road
along
which
he
was
kutuzov
looked
at
them
stopped
his
and
inquired
what
regiment
they
belonged
they
belonged
to
a
column
that
should
have
been
far
in
front
and
in
ambush
long
before
may
be
a
thought
the
old
but
a
little
further
on
he
saw
infantry
regiments
with
their
arms
piled
and
the
only
partly
eating
their
rye
porridge
and
carrying
he
sent
for
an
the
officer
reported
that
no
order
to
advance
had
been
not
kutuzov
but
checked
himself
immediately
and
sent
for
a
senior
getting
out
of
his
he
waited
with
drooping
head
and
breathing
pacing
silently
up
and
when
the
officer
of
the
general
staff
whom
he
had
kutuzov
went
purple
in
the
not
because
that
officer
was
to
blame
for
the
but
because
he
was
an
object
of
sufficient
importance
for
him
to
vent
his
wrath
trembling
and
panting
the
old
man
fell
into
that
state
of
fury
in
which
he
sometimes
used
to
roll
on
the
and
he
fell
upon
threatening
him
with
his
shouting
and
loading
him
with
gross
another
captain
who
happened
to
turn
up
and
who
was
not
at
all
to
suffered
the

sort
of
another
blackguard
are
have
you
yelled
kutuzov
in
a
hoarse
waving
his
arms
and
he
was
suffering
the
a
serene
highness
who
everybody
said
possessed
powers
such
as
no
man
had
ever
had
in
to
be
placed
in

the
laughingstock
of
the
whole

been
in
such
a

to
pray
about

have
kept
awake
thinking
everything
over

thought
he
to

was
a
chit
of
an
officer
no
one
would
have
dared
to
mock
me
and
he
was
in
a
state
of
physical
suffering
as
if
from
corporal
and
could
not
avoid
expressing
it
by
cries
of
anger
and
but
his
strength
soon
began
to
fail
and
looking
about
conscious
of
having
said
much
that
was
he
again
got
into
his
caleche
and
drove
back

blinking
feebly
he
listened
to
excuses

did
not

the
insistence

next
day
the
troops
assembled
in
their
appointed
places
in
the
evening
and
advanced
during
the
it
was
an
autumn
night
with
dark
purple
but
no
the
ground
was
damp
but
not
and
the
troops
advanced
only
occasionally
a
jingling
of
the
artillery
could
be
faintly
the
men
were
forbidden
to
talk
out
to
smoke
their
or
to
strike
a
and
they
tried
to
prevent
their
horses
the
secrecy
of
the
undertaking
heightened
its
charm
and
they
marched
some
supposing
they
had
reached
their
piled
and
settled
down
on
the
cold
but
the
majority
marched
all
night
and
arrived
at
places
where
they
evidently
should
not
have
only
count
with
his
cossacks
least
important
detachment
of
got
to
his
appointed
place
at
the
right
this
detachment
halted
at
the
outskirts
of
a
on
the
path
leading
from
the
village
of
stromilova
to
toward
count
who
had
dozed
was
awakened
by
a
deserter
from
the
french
army
being
brought
to
this
was
a
polish
sergeant
of
who
explained
in
polish
that
he
had
come
over
because
he
had
been
slighted
in
the
that
he
ought
long
ago
to
have
been
made
an
that
he
was
braver
than
any
of
and
so
he
had
left
them
and
wished
to
pay
them
he
said
that
murat
was
spending
the
night
less
than
a
mile
from
where
they
and
that
if
they
would
let
him
have
a
convoy
of
a
hundred
men
he
would
capture
him
count
consulted
his
fellow
the
offer
was
too
tempting
to
be
everyone
volunteered
to
go
and
everybody
advised
making
the
after
much
disputing
and
grekov
with
two
cossack
regiments
decided
to
go
with
the
polish
said
count
to
the
sergeant
at
you
have
been
lying
have
you
hanged
like
a
but
if
true
you
shall
have
a
hundred
gold
without
the
with
a
resolute
mounted
and
rode
away
with
grekov
whose
men
had
quickly
they
disappeared
into
the
and
count
having
seen
grekov
shivering
from
the
freshness
of
the
early
dawn
and
excited
by
what
he
had
undertaken
on
his
own
and
began
looking
at
the
enemy
now
just
visible
in
the
deceptive
light
of
dawn
and
the
dying
our
columns
ought
to
have
begun
to
appear
on
an
open
declivity
to
his
he
looked
in
that
but
though
the
columns
would
have
been
visible
quite
far
they
were
not
to
be
it
seemed
to
the
count
that
things
were
beginning
to
stir
in
the
french
and
his
adjutant
confirmed
it
is
really
too
said
count
looking
at
the
as
often
happens
when
someone
we
have
trusted
is
no
longer
before
our
it
suddenly
seemed
quite
clear
and
obvious
to
him
that
the
sergeant
was
an
that
he
had
and
that
the
whole
russian
attack
would
be
ruined
by
the
absence
of
those
two
which
he
would
lead
away
heaven
only
knew
how
could
one
capture
a
from
among
such
a
mass
of
am
sure
that
rascal
was
said
the
can
still
be
called
said
one
of
his
who
like
count
orlov
felt
distrustful
of
the
adventure
when
he
looked
at
the
what
do
you
should
we
let
them
go
on
or
you
have
them
fetched
them
fetch
them
said
count
orlov
with
sudden
looking
at
his
will
be
too
it
is
quite
and
the
adjutant
galloped
through
the
forest
after
when
grekov
count
excited
both
by
the
abandoned
attempt
and
by
vainly
awaiting
the
infantry
columns
that
still
did
not
as
well
as
by
the
proximity
of
the
resolved
to
all
his
men
felt
the
same
he
commanded
in
a
the
men
took
their
places
and
crossed
with
reverberated
in
the
and
the
cossack
trailing
their
lances
and
advancing
one
after
another
as
if
poured
out
of
a
dashed
gaily
across
the
brook
toward
the
one
frightened
yell
from
the
first
french
soldier
who
saw
the
and
all
who
were
in
the
undressed
and
only
just
waking
ran
off
in
all
abandoning
and
had
the
cossacks
pursued
the
without
heeding
what
was
behind
and
around
they
would
have
captured
murat
and
everything
that
was
what
the
officers
but
it
was
impossible
to
make
the
cossacks
budge
when
once
they
had
got
booty
and
none
of
them
listened
to
fifteen
hundred
prisoners
and
guns
were
taken
on
the
besides
standards
and
seemed
most
important
to
the
and
the
all
this
had
to
be
dealt
the
prisoners
and
guns
the
booty
without
some
shouting
and
even
a
little
fighting
among
it
was
on
this
that
the
cossacks
all
busied
the
not
being
farther
began
to
recover
they
formed
into
detachments
and
began
still
waiting
for
the
other
columns
to
advanced
no
according
to
the
dispositions
which
said
that
first
column
will
and
so
the
infantry
of
the
belated
commanded
by
bennigsen
and
directed
by
had
started
in
due
order
as
always
had
got
but
not
to
their
appointed
as
always
happens
the
starting
began
to
murmurs
were
there
was
a
sense
of
and
finally
a
backward
adjutants
and
generals
galloped
grew
said
they
had
come
quite
wrong
and
were
gave
vent
to
a
little
and
at
last
gave
it
all
up
and
went
simply
to
get
shall
get
somewhere
or
and
they
did
indeed
get
though
not
to
their
right
a
few
eventually
even
got
to
their
right
but
too
late
to
be
of
any
use
and
only
in
time
to
be
fired
who
in
this
battle
played
the
part
of
weyrother
at
galloped
assiduously
from
place
to
finding
everything
upside
down
thus
he
stumbled
on
corps
in
a
wood
when
it
was
already
broad
though
the
corps
should
long
before
have
joined
excited
and
vexed
by
the
failure
and
supposing
that
someone
must
be
responsible
for
toll
galloped
up
to
the
commander
of
the
corps
and
began
upbraiding
him
saying
that
he
ought
to
be
general
a
fighting
old
soldier
of
placid
being
also
upset
by
all
the
and
fell
into
a
rage
to
surprise
and
quite
contrary
to
his
usual
character
and
said
disagreeable
things
to
prefer
not
to
take
lessons
from
but
i
can
die
with
my
men
as
well
as
he
and
advanced
with
a
single
coming
out
onto
a
field
under
the
this
brave
general
went
straight
leading
his
men
under
without
considering
in
his
agitation
whether
going
into
action
with
a
single
would
be
of
any
use
or
cannon
and
bullets
were
just
what
he
needed
in
his
angry
one
of
the
first
bullets
killed
and
other
bullets
killed
many
of
his
and
his
division
remained
under
fire
for
some
time
quite
chapter

meanwhile
another
column
was
to
have
attacked
the
french
from
the
but
kutuzov
accompanied
that
he
well
knew
that
nothing
but
confusion
would
come
of
this
battle
undertaken
against
his
and
as
far
as
was
in
his
power
held
the
troops
he
did
not
he
rode
silently
on
his
small
gray
indolently
answering
suggestions
that
they
should
word
attack
is
always
on
your
but
you
see
that
we
are
unable
to
execute
complicated
said
he
to
miloradovich
who
asked
permission
to
take
murat
prisoner
this
morning
or
get
to
the
place
in
and
nothing
can
be
done
he
replied
to
someone
when
kutuzov
was
informed
that
at
the
french
according
to
the
reports
of
the
cossacks
there
had
previously
been
were
now
two
battalions
of
he
gave
a
sidelong
glance
at
ermolov
who
was
behind
him
and
to
whom
he
had
not
spoken
since
the
previous
they
are
asking
to
attack
and
making
plans
of
all
but
as
soon
as
one
gets
to
business
nothing
is
and
the
takes
measures
ermolov
screwed
up
his
eyes
and
smiled
faintly
on
hearing
these
he
understood
that
for
him
the
storm
had
blown
and
that
kutuzov
would
content
himself
with
that
having
a
little
fun
at
my
said
ermolov
nudging
with
his
knee
raevski
who
was
at
his
soon
after
ermolov
moved
up
to
kutuzov
and
respectfully
is
not
too
late
your
enemy
has
not
gone
you
were
to
order
an
if
the
guards
will
not
so
much
as
see
a
little
kutuzov
did
not
but
when
they
reported
to
him
that
troops
were
in
retreat
he
ordered
an
though
at
every
hundred
paces
he
halted
for
three
quarters
of
an
the
whole
battle
consisted
in
what
cossacks
had
the
rest
of
the
army
merely
lost
some
hundreds
of
men
in
consequence
of
this
battle
kutuzov
received
a
diamond
and
bennigsen
some
diamonds
and
a
hundred
thousand
others
also
received
pleasant
recognitions
corresponding
to
their
various
and
following
the
battle
fresh
changes
were
made
in
the
how
everything
is
done
with
all
said
the
russian
officers
and
generals
after
the
tarutino
letting
it
be
understood
that
some
fool
there
is
doing
things
all
wrong
but
that
we
ourselves
should
not
have
done
just
as
people
speak
but
people
who
talk
like
that
either
do
not
know
what
they
are
talking
about
or
deliberately
deceive
no
or
place
as
those
who
planned
it
that
is
an
essential
a
countless
number
of
free
forces
nowhere
is
man
freer
than
during
a
where
it
is
a
question
of
life
and
influence
the
course
taken
by
the
and
that
course
never
can
be
known
in
advance
and
never
coincides
with
the
direction
of
any
one
if
many
simultaneously
and
variously
directed
forces
act
on
a
given
the
direction
of
its
motion
cannot
coincide
with
any
one
of
those
but
will
always
be
a

mechanics

represented
by
the
diagonal
of
a
parallelogram
of
if
in
the
descriptions
given
by
especially
french
we
find
their
wars
and
battles
carried
out
in
accordance
with
previously
formed
the
only
conclusion
to
be
drawn
is
that
those
descriptions
are
the
battle
of
tarutino
obviously
did
not
attain
the
aim
toll
had
in
lead
the
troops
into
action
in
the
order
prescribed
by
the
nor
that
which
count
may
have
had
in
to
take
murat
nor
the
result
of
immediately
destroying
the
whole
which
bennigsen

if
the

was
what
actually
resulted
and
what
all
the
russians
of
that
day
drive
the
french
out

quite
clear
that
the

outcome
of
this
with
a
minimum
of

and
insignificant
despite
the

the
most
important
results
of
the
whole
campaign
were
the
transition
from
retreat
to
an
exposure
of
the
weakness
of

and
the
administration

shock

awaited

can
be
no

about
the
victory
for

in

the
french
held
at

for

very
simple
and
easy
steps
were
not
to
allow
the
troops
to
to
prepare

which
there
was

in

for
the

to
collect

the
french
there
were
enough
in
moscow
to
supply
the
whole
army

six
yet
that
greatest
of
all
who
the
historians
declare
had
control
of
the
took
none
of
these
he
not
merely
did
nothing
of
the
but
on
the
contrary
he
used
his
power
to
select
the
most
foolish
and
ruinous
of
all
the
courses
open
to
of
all
that
napoleon
might
have
wintering
in
advancing
on
petersburg
or
on
or
retiring
by
a
more
northerly
or
more
southerly
route
by
the
road
kutuzov
afterwards
nothing
more
stupid
or
disastrous
can
be
imagined
than
what
he
actually
he
remained
in
moscow
till
letting
the
troops
plunder
the
hesitating
whether
to
leave
a
garrison
behind
he
quitted
approached
kutuzov
without
joining
turned
to
the
right
and
reached
again
without
attempting
to
break
through
and
take
the
road
kutuzov
but
retiring
instead
to
mozhaysk
along
the
devastated
smolensk
nothing
more
stupid
than
that
could
have
been
or
more
disastrous
for
the
as
the
sequel
had
aim
been
to
destroy
his
the
most
skillful
strategist
could
hardly
have
devised
any
series
of
actions
that
would
so
completely
have
accomplished
that
independently
of
anything
the
russian
army
might
the
man
of
did
but
to
say
that
he
destroyed
his
army
because
he
wished
or
because
he
was
very
would
be
as
unjust
as
to
say
that
he
had
brought
his
troops
to
moscow
because
he
wished
to
and
because
he
was
very
clever
and
a
in
both
cases
his
personal
having
no
more
force
than
the
personal
activity
of
any
merely
coincided
with
the
laws
that
guided
the
the
historians
quite
falsely
represent
faculties
as
having
weakened
in
and
do
so
only
because
the
results
did
not
justify
his
he
employed
all
his
ability
and
strength
to
do
the
best
he
could
for
himself
and
his
as
he
had
done
previously
and
as
he
did
subsequently
in
his
activity
at
that
time
was
no
less
astounding
than
it
was
in
in
in
and
in
we
do
not
know
for
certain
in
how
far
his
genius
was
genuine
in
forty
centuries
looked
down
upon
his
his
great
exploits
there
are
all
told
us
by
we
cannot
accurately
estimate
his
genius
in
austria
or
for
we
have
to
draw
our
information
from
french
or
german
and
the
incomprehensible
surrender
of
whole
corps
without
fighting
and
of
fortresses
without
a
siege
must
incline
germans
to
recognize
his
genius
as
the
only
explanation
of
the
war
carried
on
in
but
thank
have
no
need
to
recognize
his
genius
in
order
to
hide
our
we
have
paid
for
the
right
to
look
at
the
matter
plainly
and
and
we
will
not
abandon
that
his
activity
in
moscow
was
as
amazing
and
as
full
of
genius
as
order
after
order
and
plan

were

him

and
pillage
were
renewed
more
violently
than

the

with
regret
that
the
picked
soldiers
appointed
to
guard
his

set
an
example

disobedience

such
a

by

him
a

issued
the

for
departure

the

he
did
not

all
the

he
had
done
with
those
of
a
certain
marshal
when
approaching
he
gazed
at
the
caleches

carriages
in
which
soldiers
were
riding

remarked
that
it
was
a
very
good
as
those

in
the
morning
of

sixth
of

pierre
went
out
of

on
returning
stopped
by
the

with
a

always
returned

it

never

it
still

nobody

had
no

told

called

karataev

called

sometimes
its

of

even
of

or
any
definite
color
did
not
seem
to
trouble
the
dog
in
the
its
furry
tail
stood
up
firm
and
round
as
a
its
bandy
legs
served
it
so
well
that
it
would
often
gracefully
lift
a
hind
leg
and
run
very
easily
and
quickly
on

as
if
disdaining
to
use
all
everything
pleased
now
it
would
roll
on
its

remnant
of
his
former

of
trousers
which
by
advice
he
tied
with
string
round
the
ankles
for

a
peasant
coat

physically
he
had
changed
much
during
this
he
no
longer

he
still
had
the
appearance

animatedly
as
never
the
former
slackness

itself

replaced
by

across

at

at

every

he
looked
at
his

a
smile
of
animated
flitted
across
his
the
sight
of

reminded
him
of
all
he
had
experienced
and
learned
during
these
weeks
and
this
recollection
was
pleasant
to
for
some
days
the
weather
had
been
calm
and
clear
with
slight
frosts
in
the
is
called

in
the
sunshine
the
air
was
and
that
warmth
was
particularly
pleasant
with
the
invigorating
freshness
of
the
morning
frost
still
in

on
and
the
magic
crystal
glitter
seen
only
at
that

corners
of

house
in
the
all
stood
out
in
the
transparent
air
in
most
delicate
outline
and
with
unnatural
near
by
could
be
seen
the
familiar
ruins
of
a
mansion
occupied
by
the
with
lilac
bushes
still
showing
dark
green
beside
the
and
even
that
ruined
and
befouled
in
dull
weather
was
repulsively
quietly
beautiful
in
the
motionless
a
french
with
coat
unbuttoned
in
a
homely
a
skullcap
on
his
and
a
short
pipe
in
his
came
from
behind
a
corner
of
the
shed
and
approached
pierre
with
a
friendly
monsieur
name
for
just
like
and
the
corporal
leaned
against
the
door
and
offered
pierre
his
though
whenever
he
offered
it
pierre
always
declined
be
on
the
march
in
such
he
pierre
inquired
what
was
being
said
about
and
the
corporal
told
him
that
nearly
all
the
troops
were
starting
and
there
ought
to
be
an
order
about
the
prisoners
that
one
of
the
soldiers
in
the
shed
with
was
and
pierre
told
the
corporal
that
something
should
be
done
about
the
corporal
replied
that
pierre
need
not
worry
about
that
as
they
had
an
ambulance
and
a
permanent
hospital
and
arrangements
would
be
made
for
the
and
that
in
general
everything
that
could
happen
had
been
foreseen
by
the
monsieur
you
have
only
to
say
a
word
to
the
you
he
is
a
man
who
never
forgets
speak
to
the
captain
when
he
makes
his
he
will
do
anything
for
captain
of
whom
the
corporal
spoke
often
had
long
chats
with
pierre
and
showed
him
all
sorts
of
he
said
to
me
the
other
kiril
is
a
man
of
who
speaks
he
is
a
russian
seigneur
who
has
had
but
he
is
a
he
knows
if
he
wants
anything
and
asks
he
get
a
when
one
has
you
one
likes
education
and
it
is
for
your
sake
i
mention
monsieur
the
other
day
if
it
had
not
been
for
you
that
affair
would
have
ended
and
after
chatting
a
while
the
corporal
went
affair
he
had
alluded
to
had
happened
a
few
days
fight
between
the
prisoners
and
the
french
in
which
pierre
had
succeeded
in
pacifying
his
some
of
the
prisoners
who
had
heard
pierre
talking
to
the
corporal
immediately
asked
what
the
frenchman
had
while
pierre
was
repeating
what
he
had
been
told
about
the
army
leaving
a
tattered
french
soldier
came
up
to
the
door
of
the
rapidly
and
timidly
raising
his
fingers
to
his
forehead
by
way
of
he
asked
pierre
whether
the
soldier
platoche
to
whom
he
had
given
a
shirt
to
sew
was
in
that
a
week
before
the
french
had
had
boot
leather
and
linen
issued
to
which
they
had
given
out
to
the
prisoners
to
make
up
into
boots
and
shirts
for
dear
said
coming
out
with
a
neatly
folded
on
account
of
the
warm
weather
and
for
convenience
at
was
wearing
only
trousers
and
a
tattered
shirt
as
black
as
his
hair
was
bound
workman
with
a
wisp
of
and
his
round
face
seemed
rounder
and
pleasanter
than
promise
is
own
brother
to
i
said
friday
and
here
it
said
smiling
and
unfolding
the
shirt
he
had
the
frenchman
glanced
around
uneasily
and
as
if
overcoming
his
rapidly
threw
off
his
uniform
and
put
on
the
he
had
a
flowered
silk
waistcoat
next
to
his
thin
bare
but
no
he
was
evidently
afraid
the
prisoners
looking
on
would
laugh
at
and
thrust
his
head
into
the
shirt
none
of
the
prisoners
said
a
it
fits
platon
kept
pulling
the
shirt
the
having
pushed
his
head
and
hands
without
raising
his
looked
down
at
the
shirt
and
examined
the
dear
this
is
not
a
sewing
and
i
had
no
proper
as
they
one
needs
a
tool
even
to
kill
a
said
platon
with
one
of
his
round
obviously
pleased
with
his
quite

when
it
sets
to
your
said

admiring
his
be
nice
and
old
but
the
bits
left
said
the
frenchman
again
and
he
took
out
an
assignation
ruble
note
and
gave
it
to
give
me
the
pieces
that
are
pierre
saw
that
platon
did
not
want
to
understand
what
the
frenchman
was
and
he
looked
on
without
karataev
thanked
the
frenchman
for
the
money
and
went
on
admiring
his
own
the
frenchman
insisted
on
having
the
pieces
returned
that
were
left
over
and
asked
pierre
to
translate
what
he
does
he
want
the
bits
said
make
fine
leg
bands
for
never
and
with
a
suddenly
changed
and
saddened
took
a
small
bundle
of
scraps
from
inside
his
shirt
and
gave
it
to
the
frenchman
without
looking
at
muttered
karataev
and
went
the
frenchman
looked
at
the
considered
for
a
then
looked
inquiringly
at
pierre
as
if
look
had
told
him
suddenly
blushed
and
shouted
in
a
squeaky
keep
them
and
handing
back
the
odd
bits
he
turned
and
went
look
at
said
swaying
his
said
they
were
not
but
they
too
have
what
the
old
folk
used
to
sweating

open
a
dry
but
yet
given
it
karataev
smiled
thoughtfully
and
was
silent
awhile
looking
at
the
make
grand
leg
dear
he
and
went
back
into
the
chapter
xii
four
weeks
had
passed
since
pierre
had
been
taken
prisoner
and
though
the
french
had
offered
to
move
him
from
the
to
the
he
had
stayed
in
the
shed
where
he
was
first
in
burned
and
devastated
moscow
pierre
experienced
almost
the
extreme
limits
of
privation
a
man
can
but
thanks
to
his
physical
strength
and
of
which
he
had
till
then
been
and
thanks
especially
to
the
fact
that
the
privations
came
so
gradually
that
it
was
impossible
to
say
when
they
he
endured
his
position
not
only
lightly
but
and
just
at
this
time
he
obtained
the
tranquillity
and
ease
of
mind
he
had
formerly
striven
in
vain
to
he
had
long
sought
in
different
ways
that
tranquillity
of
that
inner
harmony
which
had
so
impressed
him
in
the
soldiers
at
the
battle
of
he
had
sought
it
in
in
in
the
dissipations
of
town
in
in
heroic
feats
of
and
in
romantic
love
for
he
had
sought
it
by
all
these
quests
and
experiments
had
failed
and
now
without
thinking
about
it
he
had
found
that
peace
and
inner
harmony
only
through
the
horror
of
through
and
through
what
he
recognized
in
those
dreadful
moments
he
had
lived
through
at
the
executions
had
as
it
were
forever
washed
away
from
his
imagination
and
memory
the
agitating
thoughts
and
feelings
that
had
formerly
seemed
so
it
did
not
now
occur
to
him
to
think
of
or
the
or
or
it
was
plain
to
him
that
all
these
things
were
no
business
of
and
that
he
was
not
called
on
to
judge
concerning
them
and
therefore
could
not
do
and
summer
weather
are
not
bound
he
repeating
words
of
which
he
found
strangely
his
intention
of
killing
napoleon
and
his
calculations
of
the
cabalistic
number
of
the
beast
of
the
apocalypse
now
seemed
to
him
meaningless
and
even
his
anger
with
his
wife
and
anxiety
that
his
name
should
not
be
smirched
now
seemed
not
merely
trivial
but
even
what
concern
was
it
of
his
that
somewhere
or
other
that
woman
was
leading
the
life
she
what
did
it
matter
to
and
especially
to
whether
or
not
they
found
out
that
their
name
was
count
he
now
often
remembered
his
conversation
with
prince
andrew
and
quite
agreed
with
though
he
understood
prince
thoughts
somewhat
prince
andrew
had
thought
and
said
that
happiness
could
only
be
but
had
said
it
with
a
shade
of
bitterness
and
irony
as
though
he
was
really
saying
that
all
desire
for
positive
happiness
is
implanted
in
us
merely
to
torment
us
and
never
be
but
pierre
believed
it
without
any
mental
the
absence
of
the
satisfaction
of
needs
and
consequent
freedom
in
the
choice
of
that
of
way
of
now
seemed
to
pierre
to
be
indubitably
highest
here
and
now
for
the
first
time
he
fully
appreciated
the
enjoyment
of
eating
when
he
wanted
to
drinking
when
he
wanted
to
sleeping
when
he
wanted
to
of
warmth
when
he
was
of
talking
to
a
fellow
man
when
he
wished
to
talk
and
to
hear
a
human
the
satisfaction
of
and
that
he
was
deprived
of
all
seemed
to
pierre
to
constitute
perfect
and
the
choice
of
that
of
his
way
of
that
that
was
so
to
him
such
an
easy
matter
that
he
forgot
that
a
superfluity
of
the
comforts
of
life
destroys
all
joy
in
satisfying
while
great
freedom
in
the
choice
of
freedom
as
his
his
and
his
social
position
had
given
him
in
his
own
just
what
makes
the
choice
of
occupation
insolubly
difficult
and
destroys
the
desire
and
possibility
of
having
an
all
daydreams
now
turned
on
the
time
when
he
would
be
yet
and
for
the
rest
of
his
he
thought
and
spoke
with
enthusiasm
of
that
month
of
of
those
joyful
and
chiefly
of
the
complete
peace
of
mind
and
inner
freedom
which
he
experienced
only
during
those
when
on
the
first
day
he
got
up
went
out
of
the
shed
at
and
saw
the
cupolas
and
crosses
of
the
new
convent
of
the
virgin
still
dark
at
the
hoarfrost
on
the
dusty
the
sparrow
and
the
wooded
banks
above
the
winding
river
vanishing
in
the
purple
when
he
felt
the
contact
of
the
fresh
air
and
heard
the
noise
of
the
crows
flying
from
moscow
across
the
and
when
afterwards
light
gleamed
from
the
east
and
the
rim
appeared
solemnly
from
behind
a
and
the
cupolas
and
the
the
distance
and
the
all
began
to
sparkle
in
the
glad
felt
a
new
joy
and
strength
in
life
such
as
he
had
never
before
and
this
not
only
stayed
with
him
during
the
whole
of
his
but
even
grew
in
strength
as
the
hardships
of
his
position
that
feeling
of
alertness
and
of
readiness
for
anything
was
still
further
strengthened
in
him
by
the
high
opinion
his
fellow
prisoners
formed
of
him
soon
after
his
arrival
at
the
with
his
knowledge
of
the
respect
shown
him
by
the
his
his
readiness
to
give
anything
asked
of
him
received
the
allowance
of
three
rubles
a
week
made
to
with
his
which
he
showed
to
the
soldiers
by
pressing
nails
into
the
walls
of
the
his
gentleness
to
his
and
his
capacity
for
sitting
still
and
thinking
without
doing
anything
seemed
to
them
he
appeared
to
them
a
rather
mysterious
and
superior
the
very
qualities
that
had
been
a
if
not
actually
to
him
in
the
world
he
had

on
the
night
between
the
sixth
and
seventh
of

and

carts
and
troops
and
baggage
trains
at
seven
in
the
morning
a
french
convoy
in
marching
wearing
shakos
and
carrying
and
enormous
stood
in
front
of
the
and
animated
french
talk
mingled
with
curses
sounded
all
along
the
in
the
shed
everyone
was
and
only
awaited
the
order
to
the
sick
pale
and
thin
with
dark
shadows
round
his
alone
sat
in
his
place
barefoot
and
not
his
prominent
from
the
emaciation
of
his
gazed
inquiringly
at
his
comrades
who
were
paying
no
attention
to
and
he
moaned
regularly
and
it
was
evidently
not
so
much
his
sufferings
that
caused
him
to
moan
had
as
his
fear
and
grief
at
being
left
girt
with
a
rope
round
his
waist
and
wearing
shoes
karataev
had
made
for
him
from
some
leather
a
french
soldier
had
torn
off
a
tea
chest
and
brought
to
have
his
boots
mended
went
up
to
the
sick
man
and
squatted
down
beside
they
are
not
all
going
they
have
a
hospital
you
may
be
better
off
than
we
said
it
will
be
the
death
of
o
moaned
the
man
in
a
louder
go
and
ask
them
again
said
rising
and
going
to
the
door
of
the
just
as
pierre
reached
the
the
corporal
who
had
offered
him
a
pipe
the
day
before
came
up
to
it
with
two
the
corporal
and
soldiers
were
in
marching
kit
with
knapsacks
and
shakos
that
had
metal
and
these
changed
their
familiar
the
corporal
according
to
to
shut
the
the
prisoners
had
to
be
counted
before
being
let
what
will
they
do
with
the
sick
pierre
but
even
as
he
spoke
he
began
to
doubt
whether
this
was
the
corporal
he
knew
or
a
so
unlike
himself
did
the
corporal
seem
at
that
just
as
pierre
was
speaking
a
sharp
rattle
of
drums
was
suddenly
heard
from
both
the
corporal
frowned
at
words
uttering
some
meaningless
slammed
the
the
shed
became
and
the
sharp
rattle
of
the
drums
on
two
sides
drowned
the
sick
it
it
said
pierre
to
and
an
involuntary
shudder
ran
down
his
in
the
changed
in
the
sound
of
his
in
the
stirring
and
deafening
noise
of
the
he
recognized
that
callous
force
which
compelled
people
against
their
will
to
kill
their
fellow
force
the
effect
of
which
he
had
witnessed
during
the
to
fear
or
to
try
to
escape
that
to
address
entreaties
or
exhortations
to
those
who
served
as
its
was
pierre
knew
this
one
had
to
wait
and
he
did
not
again
go
to
the
sick
nor
turn
to
look
at
but
stood
frowning
by
the
door
of
the
when
that
door
was
opened
and
the
crowding
against
one
another
like
a
flock
of
squeezed
into
the
pierre
pushed
his
way
forward
and
approached
that
very
captain
who
as
the
corporal
had
assured
him
was
ready
to
do
anything
for
the
captain
was
also
in
marching
and
on
his
cold
face
appeared
that
same
it
which
pierre
had
recognized
in
the
words
and
in
the
roll
of
the
pass
the
captain
frowning
and
looking
at
the
prisoners
who
thronged
past
pierre
went
up
to
though
he
knew
his
attempt
would
be
the
officer
asked
with
a
cold
look
as
if
not
recognizing
pierre
told
him
about
the
sick
manage
to
devil
take
said
the
pass
he
continued
without
looking
at
he
is
pierre
again
so
shouted
the
frowning
rattled
the
and
pierre
understood
that
this
mysterious
force
completely
controlled
these
men
and
that
it
was
now
useless
to
say
any
the
officer
prisoners
were
separated
from
the
soldiers
and
told
to
march
in
there
were
about
thirty
with
pierre
among
and
about
three
hundred
the
who
had
come
from
the
other
were
all
strangers
to
pierre
and
much
better
dressed
than
they
looked
at
him
and
at
his
shoes
as
at
an
not
far
from
him
walked
a
fat
major
with
a
angry
who
was
wearing
a
kazan
dressing
gown
tied
round
with
a
and
who
evidently
enjoyed
the
respect
of
his
fellow
he
kept
one
in
which
he
clasped
his
tobacco
inside
the
bosom
of
his
dressing
gown
and
held
the
stem
of
his
pipe
firmly
with
the
panting
and
the
major
grumbled
and
growled
at
everybody
because
he
thought
he
was
being
pushed
and
that
they
were
all
hurrying
when
they
had
nowhere
to
hurry
to
and
were
all
surprised
at
something
when
there
was
nothing
to
be
surprised
a
thin
little
was
speaking
to
conjecturing
where
they
were
now
being
taken
and
how
far
they
would
get
that
an
official
in
felt
boots
and
wearing
a
commissariat
uniform
ran
round
from
side
to
side
and
gazed
at
the
ruins
of
loudly
announcing
his
observations
as
to
what
had
been
burned
down
and
what
this
or
that
part
of
the
city
was
that
they
could
a
third
who
by
his
accent
was
a
disputed
with
the
commissariat
arguing
that
he
was
mistaken
in
his
identification
of
the
different
wards
of
are
you
disputing
said
the
major
does
it
matter
whether
it
is
nicholas
or
you
see
burned
and
an
end
of
what
are
you
pushing
the
road
wide
said
turning
to
a
man
behind
him
who
was
not
pushing
him
at
what
have
they
the
prisoners
on
one
side
and
another
were
heard
saying
as
they
gazed
on
the
charred
beyond
the
and
and
in
the
just
not
half
of
it
i
told
whole
quarter
beyond
the
and
so
it
you
know
so
the
use
of
said
the
as
they
passed
near
a
church
in
the
khamovniki
of
the
few
unburned
quarters
of
the
whole
mass
of
prisoners
suddenly
started
to
one
side
and
exclamations
of
horror
and
disgust
were
the
what
so
he
and
smeared
with
pierre
too
drew
near
the
church
where
the
thing
was
that
evoked
these
and
dimly
made
out
something
leaning
against
the
palings
surrounding
the
from
the
words
of
his
comrades
who
saw
better
than
he
he
found
that
this
was
the
body
of
a
set
upright
against
the
palings
with
its
face
smeared
with
what
the
go
thirty
thousand
the
convoy
guards
began
cursing
and
the
french
with
fresh
drove
away
with
their
swords
the
crowd
of
prisoners
who
were
gazing
at
the
dead
chapter
xiv
through
the
cross
streets
of
the
khamovniki
quarter
the
prisoners
followed
only
by
their
escort
and
the
vehicles
and
wagons
belonging
to
that
but
when
they
reached
the
supply
stores
they
came
among
a
huge
and
closely
packed
train
of
artillery
mingled
with
private
at
the
bridge
they
all
waiting
for
those
in
front
to
get
from
the
bridge
they
had
a
view
of
endless
lines
of
moving
baggage
trains
before
and
behind
to
the
where
the
kaluga
road
turns
near
endless
rows
of
troops
and
carts
stretched
away
into
the
these
were
troops
of
corps
which
had
started
before
any
of
the
along
the
riverside
and
across
the
stone
were
troops
and
in
whose
charge
were
the
were
crossing
the
crimean
bridge
and
some
were
already
debouching
into
the
kaluga
but
the
baggage
trains
stretched
out
so
that
the
last
of
train
had
not
yet
got
out
of
moscow
and
reached
the
kaluga
road
when
the
vanguard
of
army
was
already
emerging
from
the
great
ordynka
when
they
had
crossed
the
crimean
bridge
the
prisoners
moved
a
few
steps
and
again
moved
and
from
all
sides
vehicles
and
men
crowded
closer
and
closer
they
advanced
the
few
hundred
paces
that
separated
the
bridge
from
the
kaluga
taking
more
than
an
hour
to
do
and
came
out
upon
the
square
where
the
streets
of
the
transmoskva
ward
and
the
kaluga
road
and
the
prisoners
jammed
close
together
had
to
stand
for
some
hours
at
that
from
all
like
the
roar
of
the
were
heard
the
rattle
of
the
tramp
of
and
incessant
shouts
of
anger
and
pierre
stood
pressed
against
the
wall
of
a
charred
listening
to
that
noise
which
mingled
in
his
imagination
with
the
roll
of
the
to
get
a
better
several
officer
prisoners
climbed
onto
the
wall
of
the
house
against
which
pierre
was
just
look
at
the
loaded
goods
even
on
the
look
those
are
they
see
what
the
blackguards
have
see
what
that
one
has
behind
in
the
those
are
settings
taken
from
some
by
the
see
how
that
fellow
has
loaded
himself
he
can
hardly
good
even
grabbed
those

there
sitting
on

on

with

you
just
no

they
in
how
comfortably
settled
as
at
the
church
in
a
wave
of
general
curiosity
bore
all
the
prisoners
forward
onto
the
and
thanks
to
his
saw
over
the
heads
of
the
others
what
so
attracted
their

three
carriages
involved
among
the
munition
closely
squeezed
sat
women
with
rouged
dressed
in
glaring
who
were
shouting
something
in
shrill
from
the
moment
pierre
had
recognized
the
appearance
of
the
mysterious
force
nothing
had
seemed
to
him
strange
or
neither
the
corpse
smeared
with
soot
for
fun
nor
these
women
hurrying
away
nor
the
burned
ruins
of
all
that
he
now
witnessed
scarcely
made
an
impression
on
if
his
making
ready
for
a
hard
refused
to
receive
impressions
that
might
weaken
the
vehicles
drove
behind
them
came
more
gun
ammunition
more
and
now
and
then
pierre
did
not
see
the
people
as
individuals
but
saw
their
all
these
people
and
horses
seemed
driven
forward
by
some
invisible
during
the
hour
pierre
watched
them
they
all
came
flowing
from
the
different
streets
with
one
and
the
same
desire
to
get
on
they
all
jostled
one
began
to
grow
angry
and
to
white
teeth
brows
ever
the
same
words
of
abuse
flew
from
side
to
and
all
the
faces
bore
the
same
swaggeringly
resolute
and
coldly
cruel
expression
that
had
struck
pierre
that
morning
on
the
face
when
the
drums
were
it
was
not
till
nearly
evening
that
the
officer
commanding
the
escort
collected
his
men
and
with
shouts
and
quarrels
forced
his
way
in
among
the
baggage
and
the
hemmed
in
on
all
emerged
onto
the
kaluga
they
marched
very
without
and
halted
only
when
the
sun
began
to
the
baggage
carts
drew
up
close
together
and
the
men
began
to
prepare
for
their
they
all
appeared
angry
and
for
a
long
angry
and
fighting
could
be
heard
from
all
a
carriage
that
followed
the
escort
ran
into
one
of
the
carts
and
knocked
a
hole
in
it
with
its
several
soldiers
ran
toward
the
cart
from
different
some
beat
the
carriage
horses
on
their
turning
them
others
fought
among
and
pierre
saw
that
one
german
was
badly
wounded
on
the
head
by
a
it
seemed
that
all
these
now
that
they
had
stopped
amid
fields
in
the
chill
dusk
of
the
autumn
experienced
one
and
the
same
feeling
of
unpleasant
awakening
from
the
hurry
and
eagerness
to
push
on
that
had
seized
them
at
the
once
at
a
standstill
they
all
seemed
to
understand
that
they
did
not
yet
know
where
they
were
and
that
much
that
was
painful
and
difficult
awaited
them
on
this
during
this
halt
the
escort
treated
the
prisoners
even
worse
than
they
had
done
at
the
it
was
here
that
the
prisoners
for
the
first
time
received
horseflesh
for
their
meat
from
the
officer
down
to
the
lowest
soldier
they
showed
what
seemed
like
personal
spite
against
each
of
the
in
unexpected
contrast
to
their
former
friendly
this
spite
increased
still
more
on
calling
over
the
roll
of
it
was
found
that
in
the
bustle
of
leaving
moscow
one
russian
who
had
pretended
to
suffer
from
had
pierre
saw
a
frenchman
beat
a
russian
soldier
cruelly
for
straying
too
far
from
the
and
heard
his
friend
the
captain
reprimand
and
threaten
to
martial
a
noncommissioned
officer
on
account
of
the
escape
of
the
to
the
noncommissioned
excuse
that
the
prisoner
was
ill
and
could
not
the
officer
replied
that
the
order
was
to
shoot
those
who
lagged
pierre
felt
that
that
fatal
force
which
had
crushed
him
during
the
but
which
he
had
not
felt
during
his
now
again
controlled
his
it
was
but
he
felt
that
in
proportion
to
the
efforts
of
that
fatal
force
to
crush
there
grew
and
strengthened
in
his
soul
a
power
of
life
independent
of
he
ate
his
supper
of
buckwheat
soup
with
horseflesh
and
chatted
with
his
neither
pierre
nor
any
of
the
others
spoke
of
what
they
had
seen
in
or
of
the
roughness
of
their
treatment
by
the
or
of
the
order
to
shoot
them
which
had
been
announced
to
as
if
in
reaction
against
the
worsening
of
their
position
they
were
all
particularly
animated
and
they
spoke
of
personal
of
amusing
scenes
they
had
witnessed
during
the
and
avoided
all
talk
of
their
present
the
sun
had
set
long
bright
stars
shone
out
here
and
there
in
the
a
red
glow
as
of
a
conflagration
spread
above
the
horizon
from
the
rising
full
and
that
vast
red
ball
swayed
strangely
in
the
gray
it
grew
the
evening
was
but
the
night
had
not
yet
pierre
got
up
and
left
his
new
crossing
between
the
campfires
to
the
other
side
of
the
road
where
he
had
been
told
the
common
soldier
prisoners
were
he
wanted
to
talk
to
on
the
road
he
was
stopped
by
a
french
sentinel
who
ordered
him
pierre
turned
not
to
his
companions
by
the
but
to
an
unharnessed
cart
where
there
was
tucking
his
legs
under
him
and
dropping
his
head
he
sat
down
on
the
cold
ground
by
the
wheel
of
the
cart
and
remained
motionless
a
long
while
sunk
in
suddenly
he
burst
out
into
a
fit
of
his
so
loud
that
men
from
various
sides
turned
with
surprise
to
see
what
this
strange
and
evidently
solitary
laughter
could
laughed
and
he
said
aloud
to
soldier
did
not
let
me
they
took
me
and
shut
me
they
hold
me
my
immortal
and
he
laughed
till
tears
started
to
his

man
got
up
and
came
to
see
what
this
queer
big
fellow
was
laughing
at
all

pierre

got

farther
away
from
the
inquisitive
and
looked
around
the
endless
bivouac
that
had
previously
resounded
with
the
crackling
of
campfires
and
the
voices
of
many
men
had
grown
the
red
campfires
were
growing
paler
and
dying
high
up
in
the
light
sky
hung
the
full
forests
and
fields
beyond
the
unseen
were
now
visible
in
the
and
farther
beyond
those
forests
and
the
limitless
distance
lured

to

up
at
the
sky
and
the
twinkling
stars
in
its
faraway
all
that
is
all
that
is
within
and
it
is

they
caught
all
that

put
it
into

after

been

to
attack
by
a
strange
this
which
turned
out
to
be
a
most
difficult
and
important
was
entrusted
to
same
modest
little
dokhturov
whom
no
one
had
described
to
us
as
drawing
up
plans
of
dashing
about
in
front
of
showering
crosses
on
and
so
and
who
was
thought
to
be
and
was
spoken
of
as
undecided
and
whom
we
find
commanding
wherever
the
position
was
most
difficult
all
through
the
wars
from
austerlitz
to
the
year
at
austerlitz
he
remained
last
at
the
augezd
rallying
the
saving
what
was
possible
when
all
were
flying
and
perishing
and
not
a
single
general
was
left
in
the
rear
ill
with
fever
he
went
to
smolensk
with
twenty
thousand
men
to
defend
the
town
against
whole
in
at
the
malakhov
he
had
hardly
dozed
off
in
a
paroxysm
of
fever
before
he
was
awakened
by
the
bombardment
of
the
smolensk
held
out
all
day
at
the
battle
of
when
bagration
was
killed
and
nine
tenths
of
the
men
of
our
left
flank
had
fallen
and
the
full
force
of
the
french
artillery
fire
was
directed
against
the
man
sent
there
was
this
same
irresolute
and
undiscerning
hastening
to
rectify
a
mistake
he
had
made
by
sending
someone
else
there
and
the
quiet
little
dokhturov
rode
and
borodino
became
the
greatest
glory
of
the
russian
many
heroes
have
been
described
to
us
in
verse
and
but
of
dokhturov
scarcely
a
word
has
been
it
was
dokhturov
again
whom
they
sent
to
forminsk
and
from
there
to
the
place
where
the
last
battle
with
the
french
was
fought
and
where
the
obvious
disintegration
of
the
french
army
and
we
are
told
of
many
geniuses
and
heroes
of
that
period
of
the
but
of
dokhturov
nothing
or
very
little
is
said
and
that
and
this
silence
about
dokhturov
is
the
clearest
testimony
to
his
it
is
natural
for
a
man
who
does
not
understand
the
workings
of
a
machine
to
imagine
that
a
shaving
that
has
fallen
into
it
by
chance
and
is
interfering
with
its
action
and
tossing
about
in
it
is
its
most
important
the
man
who
does
not
understand
the
construction
of
the
machine
cannot
conceive
that
the
small
connecting
cogwheel
which
revolves
quietly
is
one
of
the
most
essential
parts
of
the
and
not
the
shaving
which
merely
harms
and
hinders
the
on
the
tenth
of
october
when
dokhturov
had
gone
halfway
to
forminsk
and
stopped
at
the
village
of
preparing
faithfully
to
execute
the
orders
he
had
the
whole
french
army
in
its
convulsive
reached
position
apparently
in
order
to
give
suddenly
without
any
reason
turned
off
to
the
left
onto
the
new
kaluga
road
and
began
to
enter
where
only
broussier
had
been
till
at
that
time
dokhturov
had
under
his
besides
the
two
small
guerrilla
detachments
of
figner
and
on
the
evening
of
october
11
seslavin
came
to
the

headquarters
with
a
french
guardsman
he
had
the
prisoner
said
that
the
troops
that
had
entered
forminsk
that
day
were
the
vanguard
of
the
whole
that
napoleon
was
there
and
the
whole
army
had
left
moscow
four
days
that
same
evening
a
house
serf
who
had
come
from
borovsk
said
he
had
seen
an
immense
army
entering
the
some
cossacks
of
detachment
reported
having
sighted
the
french
guards
marching
along
the
road
to
from
all
these
reports
it
was
evident
that
where
they
had
expected
to
meet
a
single
division
there
was
now
the
whole
french
army
marching
from
moscow
in
an
unexpected

was
unwilling
to
undertake
any
as
it
was
not
clear
to
him

what
he
ought
to
he
had
been
ordered
to

only

been
there
at
that

now
the

french
army
was

to
act
on
his

dokhturov
insisted
that
he
must

it
was
decided
to
send
a
dispatch

the

this
purpose
a

was
to

the
whole

in

the

in

was
lifted
at

resolute
face
with
cheeks
flushed
by

still
remained
for
an
instant
a
faraway
dreamy
expression
remote
from

but
then
he
suddenly
started
and
his
face
assumed
its
habitual
calm
and
firm
what

asked
immediately
but
without
blinking
at
the
while
listening
to
the
report
konovnitsyn
broke
the
seal
and
read
the
hardly

he
done
so
before
he
lowered
his
legs
in
their
woolen
stockings
to

get

let
us
go
to
his
konovnitsyn
had
understood
at
once
that
the
news
brought
was
of
great
importance
and
that
no
time
must
be
he
did
not
consider
or
ask
himself
whether
the
news
was
good
or
that
did
not
interest
he
regarded
the
whole
business
of
the
war
not
with
his
intelligence
or
his
reason
but
by
something
there
was
within
him
a
deep
unexpressed
conviction
that
all
would
be
but
that
one
must
not
trust
to
this
and
still
less
speak
about
but
must
only
attend
to
own
and
he
did
his
giving
his
whole
strength
to
the
peter
petrovich
like
seems
to
have
been
included
merely
for
sake
in
the
list
of
the
heroes
of
and
like
dokhturov
he
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
man
of
very
limited
capacity
and
and
like
dokhturov
he
never
made
plans
of
battle
but
was
always
found
where
the
situation
was
most
since
his
appointment
as
general
on
duty
he
had
always
slept
with
his
door
giving
orders
that
every
messenger
should
be
allowed
to
wake
him
in
battle
he
was
always
under
so
that
kutuzov
reproved
him
for
it
and
feared
to
send
him
to
the
and
like
dokhturov
he
was
one
of
those
unnoticed
cogwheels
without
clatter
or
constitute
the
most
essential
part
of
the
coming
out
of
the
hut
into
the
dark
night
konovnitsyn
partly
from
an
increased
pain
in
his
head
and
partly
at
the
unpleasant
thought
that
occurred
to
of
how
all
that
nest
of
influential
men
on
the
staff
would
be
stirred
up
by
this
especially
who
ever
since
tarutino
had
been
at
daggers
drawn
with
and
how
they
would
make
issue
and
rescind
and
this
premonition
was
disagreeable
to
him
though
he
knew
it
could
not
be
and
in
fact
to
whom
he
went
to
communicate
the
immediately
began
to
expound
his
plans
to
a
general
sharing
his
until
who
listened
in
weary
reminded
him
that
they
must
go
to
see
his
chapter
xvii
kutuzov
like
all
old
people
did
not
sleep
much
at
he
often
fell
asleep
unexpectedly
in
the
but
at
lying
on
his
bed
without
he
generally
remained
awake
so
he
lay
now
on
his
supporting
his
scarred
head
on
his
plump
with
his
one
eye
meditating
and
peering
into
the
since
who
corresponded
with
the
emperor
and
had
more
influence
than
anyone
else
on
the
had
begun
to
avoid
kutuzov
was
more
at
ease
as
to
the
possibility
of
himself
and
his
troops
being
obliged
to
take
part
in
useless
aggressive
the
lesson
of
the
tarutino
battle
and
of
the
day
before
which
kutuzov
remembered
with
he
have
some
effect
on
others
must
understand
that
we
can
only
lose
by
taking
the
patience
and
time
are
my
my
thought
he
knew
that
an
apple
should
not
be
plucked
while
it
is
it
will
fall
of
itself
when
but
if
picked
unripe
the
apple
is
the
tree
is
and
your
teeth
are
set
on
like
an
experienced
sportsman
he
knew
that
the
beast
was
and
wounded
as
only
the
whole
strength
of
russia
could
have
wounded
but
whether
it
was
mortally
wounded
or
not
was
still
an
undecided
now
by
the
fact
of
lauriston
and
barthelemi
having
been
and
by
the
reports
of
the
kutuzov
was
almost
sure
that
the
wound
was
but
he
needed
further
proofs
and
it
was
necessary
to
want
to
run
to
see
how
they
have
wounded
wait
and
we
shall
continual
continual
thought
only
to
distinguish
as
if
fighting
were
they
are
like
children
from
whom
one
get
any
sensible
account
of
what
has
happened
because
they
all
want
to
show
how
well
they
can
but
not
what
is
needed
what
ingenious
maneuvers
they
all
propose
to
it
seems
to
them
that
when
they
have
thought
of
two
or
three
remembered
the
general
plan
sent
him
from
have
foreseen
but
the
contingencies
are
the
undecided
question
as
to
whether
the
wound
inflicted
at
borodino
was
mortal
or
not
had
hung
over
head
for
a
whole
on
the
one
hand
the
french
had
occupied
on
the
other
kutuzov
felt
assured
with
all
his
being
that
the
terrible
blow
into
which
he
and
all
the
russians
had
put
their
whole
strength
must
have
been
but
in
any
case
proofs
were
he
had
waited
a
whole
month
for
them
and
grew
more
impatient
the
longer
he
lying
on
his
bed
during
those
sleepless
nights
he
did
just
what
he
reproached
those
younger
generals
for
he
imagined
all
sorts
of
possible
just
like
the
younger
but
with
this
that
he
saw
thousands
of
contingencies
instead
of
two
or
three
and
based
nothing
on
the
longer
he
thought
the
more
contingencies
presented
he
imagined
all
sorts
of
movements
of
the
napoleonic
army
as
a
whole
or
in
or
against
or
to
outflank
he
thought
too
of
the
possibility
he
feared
most
of
that
napoleon
might
fight
him
with
his
own
weapon
and
remain
in
moscow
awaiting
kutuzov
even
imagined
that
army
might
turn
back
through
medyn
and
but
the
one
thing
he
could
not
foresee
was
what
convulsive
stampede
of
army
during
its
first
eleven
days
after
leaving
a
stampede
which
made
possible
what
kutuzov
had
not
yet
even
dared
to
think
complete
extermination
of
the
report
about
the
reports
of
distress
in
rumors
of
preparations
for
leaving
all
confirmed
the
supposition
that
the
french
army
was
beaten
and
preparing
for
but
these
were
only
which
seemed
important
to
the
younger
men
but
not
to
with
his
sixty
experience
he
knew
what
value
to
attach
to
knew
how
apt
people
who
desire
anything
are
to
group
all
news
so
that
it
appears
to
confirm
what
they
and
he
knew
how
readily
in
such
cases
they
omit
all
that
makes
for
the
and
the
more
he
desired
it
the
less
he
allowed
himself
to
believe
this
question
absorbed
all
his
mental
all
else
was
to
him
only
customary
to
such
customary
routine
belonged
his
conversations
with
the
the
letters
he
wrote
from
tarutino
to
madame
de
the
reading
of
the
distribution
of
his
correspondence

so
but
the
destruction
of
the
which
he
alone

his
one
on
the
night
of
the
eleventh
of
october
he
lay
leaning
on
his
arm
and
thinking
of

was
a
stir
in
the
next
room

he
heard
the
steps

moscow
it
had
borne
within
as
it
the
chemical
elements
of
the
members
of
what
had
once
been
an
himself
and
all
his
soldiers
knowing
each
concerned
only
to
make
his
escape
as
quickly
as
possible
from
this
of
the
hopelessness
of
which
they
were
all
more
or
less
vaguely
so
it
came
about
that
at
the
council
at
when
the
generals
pretending
to
confer
together
expressed
various
all
mouths
were
closed
by
the
opinion
uttered
by
the
soldier
mouton
speaking
said
what
they
all
that
the
one
thing
needful
was
to
get
away
as
quickly
as
and
no
not
even
could
say
anything
against
that
truth
which
they
all
but
though
they
all
realized
that
it
was
necessary
to
get
there
still
remained
a
feeling
of
shame
at
admitting
that
they
must
an
external
shock
was
needed
to
overcome
that
and
this
shock
came
in
due
it
was
what
the
french
called
hourra
de
the
day
after
the
council
at
napoleon
rode
out
early
in
the
morning
amid
the
lines
of
his
army
with
his
suite
of
marshals
and
an
on
the
pretext
of
inspecting
the
army
and
the
scene
of
the
previous
and
of
the
impending
some
cossacks
on
the
prowl
for
booty
fell
in
with
the
emperor
and
very
nearly
captured
if
the
cossacks
did
not
capture
napoleon
what
saved
him
was
the
very
thing
that
was
destroying
the
french
the
booty
on
which
the
cossacks
here
as
at
tarutino
they
went
after
leaving
the
disregarding
napoleon
they
rushed
after
the
plunder
and
napoleon
managed
to
when
les
enfants
du
don
might
so
easily
have
taken
the
emperor
himself
in
the
midst
of
his
it
was
clear
that
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
fly
as
fast
as
possible
along
the
familiar
napoleon
with
his
stomach
understood
that
not
feeling
his
former
agility
and
and
under
the
influence
of
the
fright
the
cossacks
had
given
him
he
at
once
agreed
with
mouton
and
issued
as
the
historians
tell
retreat
by
the
smolensk
that
napoleon
agreed
with
and
that
the
army
does
not
prove
that
napoleon
caused
it
to
but
that
the
forces
which
influenced
the
whole
army
and
directed
it
along
the
mozhaysk
the
road
acted
simultaneously
on
him
chapter
xix
a
man
in
motion
always
devises
an
aim
for
that
to
be
able
to
go
a
thousand
miles
he
must
imagine
that
something
good
awaits
him
at
the
end
of
those
thousand

must
have
the
prospect
of
a
promised
land
to
have
the
strength
to
the
promised
land
for
the
french
during
their
advance
had
been
during
their
retreat
it
was
their
native
but
that
native
land
was
too
far
and
for
a
man
going
a
thousand
miles
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
set
aside
his
final
goal
and
to
say
to
i
shall
get
to
a
place
miles
off
where
i
shall
rest

spend

during
the
first
journey
that
resting
place
eclipses
his
ultimate
goal
and
attracts
all
his
hopes

and
the
impulses
felt
by
a
single
person
are
always
magnified
in

the
final

their
immediate
goal
was
toward
which
all
their
desires
and
enormously
intensified
in
the
urged
them
it
was
not
that
they
knew
that
much
food
and
fresh
troops
awaited
them
in
nor
that
they
were
told
so
the
contrary
their
superior
and
napoleon
knew
that
provisions
were
scarce
but
because
this
alone
could
give
them
strength
to
move
on
and
endure
their
present
so
both
those
who
knew
and
those
who
did
not
know
deceived
and
pushed
on
to
smolensk
as
to
a
promised
coming
out
onto
the
highroad
the
french
fled
with
surprising
energy
and
rapidity
toward
the
goal
they
had
fixed
besides
the
common
impulse
which
bound
the
whole
crowd
of
french
into
one

nothing
more
than
to
give
himself
up

from

this
horror

on

the

to

on
the

such
pretexts
did
not

i
the
battle
of
with
the
occupation
of
moscow
that
followed
it
and
the
flight
of
the
french
without
further
is
one
of
the
most
instructive
phenomena
in
all
historians
agree
that
the
external
activity
of
states
and
nations
in
their
conflicts
with
one
another
is
expressed
in
and
that
as
a
direct
result
of
greater
or
less
success
in
war
the
political
strength
of
states
and
nations
increases
or
strange
as
may
be
the
historical
account
of
how
some
king
or
having
quarreled
with
collects
an
fights
his
gains
a
victory
by
killing
or
ten
thousand
and
subjugates
a
kingdom
and
an
entire
nation
of
several
all
the
facts
of
history
far
as
we
know
confirm
the
truth
of
the
statement
that
the
greater
or
lesser
success
of
one
army
against
another
is
the
or
at
least
an
essential
of
an
increase
or
decrease
in
the
strength
of
the
though
it
is
unintelligible
why
the
defeat
of
an
hundredth
part
of
a
oblige
that
whole
nation
to
an
army
gains
a
and
at
once
the
rights
of
the
conquering
nation
have
increased
to
the
detriment
of
the
an
army
has
suffered
and
at
once
a
people
loses
its
rights
in
proportion
to
the
severity
of
the

if
its
army
suffers
a
complete
defeat
the
nation
is
quite
so
according
to
history
it
has
been
found
from
the
most
ancient
and
so
it
is
to
our
own
all
wars
serve
to
confirm
this

to
the
defeat
of
the
austrian
army
austria
loses
its

the

after
with
no
further
it
is
not
russia
that
ceases
to
but
the
french
army
of
six
hundred
and
then
napoleonic
france
to
strain
the
facts
to
fit
the
rules
of
to
say
that
the
field
of
battle
at
borodino
remained
in
the
hands
of
the
or
that
after
moscow
there
were
other
battles
that
destroyed

after
the
french
victory
at
borodino
there
was
no
general
engagement
nor
any
that
were
at
all
yet
the
french
army
ceased
to
what
does
this
if
it
were
an
example
taken
from
the
history
of
we
might
say
that
it
was
not
an
historic
phenomenon
is
the
usual
expedient
when
anything
does
not
fit
their
if
the
matter
concerned
some
brief
conflict
in
which
only
a
small
number
of
troops
took
we
might
treat
it
as
an
but
this
event
occurred
before
our
and
for
them
it
was
a
question
of
the
life
or
death
of
their
and
it
happened
in
the
greatest
of
all
known
the
period
of
the
campaign
of
1812
from
the
battle
of
borodino
to
the
expulsion
of
the
french
proved
that
the
winning
of
a
battle
does
not
produce
a
conquest
and
is
not
even
an
invariable
indication
of
it
proved
that
the
force
which
decides
the
fate
of
peoples
lies
not
in
the
nor
even
in
armies
and
but
in
something
the
french
describing
the
condition
of
the
french
army
before
it
left
affirm
that
all
was
in
order
in
the
grand
except
the
the
and
the
was
no
forage
for
the
horses
or
the
that
was
a
misfortune
no
one
could
for
the
peasants
of
the
district
burned
their
hay
rather
than
let
the
french
have
the
victory
gained
did
not
bring
the
usual
results
because
the
peasants
karp
and
vlas
after
the
french
had
evacuated
moscow
drove
in
their
carts
to
pillage
the
and
in
general
personally
failed
to
manifest
any
heroic
and
the
whole
innumerable
multitude
of
such
did
not
bring
their
hay
to
moscow
for
the
high
price
offered
but
burned
it
let
us
imagine
two
men
who
have
come
out
to
fight
a
duel
with
rapiers
according
to
all
the
rules
of
the
art
of
the
fencing
has
gone
on
for
some
suddenly
one
of
the
feeling
himself
wounded
and
understanding
that
the
matter
is
no
joke
but
concerns
his
throws
down
his
and
seizing
the
first
cudgel
that
comes
to
hand
begins
to
brandish
then
let
us
imagine
that
the
combatant
who
so
sensibly
employed
the
best
and
simplest
means
to
attain
his
end
was
at
the
same
time
influenced
by
traditions
of
chivalry
desiring
to
conceal
the
facts
of
the
insisted
that
he
had
gained
his
victory
with
the
rapier
according
to
all
the
rules
of
one
can
imagine
what
confusion
and
obscurity
would
result
from
such
an
account
of
the
the
fencer
who
demanded
a
contest
according
to
the
rules
of
fencing
was
the
french
his
opponent
who
threw
away
the
rapier
and
snatched
up
the
cudgel
was
the
russian
those
who
try
to
explain
the
matter
according
to
the
rules
of
fencing
are
the
historians
who
have
described
the
after
the
burning
of
smolensk
a
war
began
which
did
not
follow
any
previous
traditions
of
the
burning
of
towns
and
the
retreats
after
the
blow
dealt
at
borodino
and
the
renewed
the
burning
of
the
capture
of
the
seizure
of
and
the
guerrilla
war
were
all
departures
from
the
napoleon
felt
and
from
the
time
he
took
up
the
correct
fencing
attitude
in
moscow
and
instead
of
his
rapier
saw
a
cudgel
raised
above
his
he
did
not
cease
to
complain
to
kutuzov
and
to
the
emperor
alexander
that
the
war
was
being
carried
on
contrary
to
all
the
if
there
were
any
rules
for
killing
in
spite
of
the
complaints
of
the
french
as
to
the
nonobservance
of
the
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
to
some
highly
placed
russians
it
seemed
rather
disgraceful
to
fight
with
a
cudgel
and
they
wanted
to
assume
a
pose
en
quarte
or
en
tierce
according
to
all
the
and
to
make
an
adroit
thrust
en
and
so
cudgel
of
the
war
was
lifted
with
all
its
menacing
and
majestic
and
without
consulting
tastes
or
rules
and
regardless
of
anything
it
rose
and
fell
with
stupid
but
and
belabored
the
french
till
the
whole
invasion
had
and
it
is
well
for
a
people
who
do
the
french
did
in
salute
according
to
all
the
rules
of
presenting
the
hilt
of
their
rapier
gracefully
and
hand
it
to
their
magnanimous
but
at
the
moment
of
without
asking
what
rules
others
have
adopted
in
similar
simply
and
easily
pick
up
the
first
cudgel
that
comes
to
hand
and
strike
with
it
till
the
feeling
of
resentment
and
revenge
in
their
soul
yields
to
a
feeling
of
contempt
and
chapter
ii
one
of
the
most
obvious
and
advantageous
departures
from
the
laws
of
war
is
the
action
of
scattered
groups
against
men
pressed
together
in
a
such
action
always
occurs
in
wars
that
take
on
a
national
in
such
instead
of
two
crowds
opposing
each
the
men
attack
run
away
when
attacked
by
stronger
but
again
attack
when
opportunity
this
was
done
by
the
guerrillas
in
by
the
mountain
tribes
in
the
and
by
the
russians
in
people
have
called
this
kind
of
war
and
assume
that
by
so
calling
it
they
have
explained
its
but
such
a
war
does
not
fit
in
under
any
rule
and
is
directly
opposed
to
a
rule
of
tactics
which
is
accepted
as
that
rule
says
that
an
attacker
should
concentrate
his
forces
in
order
to
be
stronger
than
his
opponent
at
the
moment
of
guerrilla
war
as
history
directly
infringes
that
this
contradiction
arises
from
the
fact
that
military
science
assumes
the
strength
of
an
army
to
be
identical
with
its
military
science
says
that
the
more
troops
the
greater
the
les
gros
bataillons
ont
toujours
large
battalions
are
always
for
military
science
to
say
this
is
like
defining
momentum
in
mechanics
by
reference
to
the
mass
stating
that
momenta
are
equal
or
unequal
to
each
other
simply
because
the
masses
involved
are
equal
or
momentum
of
is
the
product
of
mass
and
in
military
affairs
the
strength
of
an
army
is
the
product
of
its
mass
and
some
unknown
military
seeing
in
history
innumerable
instances
of
the
fact
that
the
size
of
any
army
does
not
coincide
with
its
strength
and
that
small
detachments
defeat
larger
obscurely
admits
the
existence
of
this
unknown
factor
and
tries
to
discover
in
a
geometric
now
in
the
equipment
and
most
in
the
genius
of
the
but
the
assignment
of
these
various
meanings
to
the
factor
does
not
yield
results
which
accord
with
the
historic
yet
it
is
only
necessary
to
abandon
the
false
view
to
gratify
the
of
the
efficacy
of
the
directions
issued
in
wartime
by
in
order
to
find
this
unknown
that
unknown
quantity
is
the
spirit
of
the
that
is
to
the
greater
or
lesser
readiness
to
fight
and
face
danger
felt
by
all
the
men
composing
an
quite
independently
of
whether
they
or
are
fighting
under
the
command
of
a
in
with
cudgels
or
with
rifles
that
repeat
thirty
times
a
men
who
want
to
fight
will
always
put
themselves
in
the
most
advantageous
conditions
for
the
spirit
of
an
army
is
the
factor
which
multiplied
by
the
mass
gives
the
resulting
to
define
and
express
the
significance
of
this
unknown
spirit
of
an
a
problem
for
this
problem
is
only
solvable
if
we
cease
arbitrarily
to
substitute
for
the
unknown
x
itself
the
conditions
under
which
that
force
becomes
as
the
commands
of
the
the
equipment
and
so
these
for
the
real
significance
of
the
and
if
we
recognize
this
unknown
quantity
in
its
entirety
as
being
the
greater
or
lesser
desire
to
fight
and
to

only
expressing
known
historic
facts
by
equations
and
comparing
the
relative
significance
of
this

we
hope
to
define

kill

take

on

side
four

on

this

not

gives
us
a

exist

be
the
tactical
rule
that
an
army
should
act
in
masses
when
and
in
smaller
groups
in
unconsciously
confirms
the
truth
that
the
strength
of
an
army
depends
on
its
to
lead
men
forward
under
fire
more
discipline
only
by
movement
in
is
needed
than
is
needed
to
resist
but
this
rule
which
leaves
out
of
account
the
spirit
of
the
army
continually
proves
incorrect
and
is
in
particularly
striking
contrast
to
the
facts
when
some
strong
rise
or
fall
in
the
spirit
of
the
troops
as
in
all
national
the
retreating
in
according
to
tactics
they
should
have
separated
into
detachments
to
defend
into
a
mass
because
the
spirit
of
the
army
had
so
fallen
that
only
the
mass
held
the
army
the
on
the
ought
according
to
tactics
to
have
attacked
in
but
in
fact
they
split
up
into
small
because
their
spirit
had
so
risen
that
separate
without
dealt
blows
at
the
french
without
needing
any
compulsion
to
induce
them
to
expose
themselves
to
hardships
and
chapter
iii
the
partisan
war
began
with
the
entry
of
the
french
into
before
partisan
warfare
had
been
officially
recognized
by
the
thousands
of
enemy
and
foragers
had
been
destroyed
by
the
cossacks
and
the
who
killed
them
off
as
instinctively
as
dogs
worry
a
stray
mad
dog
to
denis
with
his
russian
was
the
first
to
recognize
the
value
of
this
terrible
cudgel
which
regardless
of
the
rules
of
military
science
destroyed
the
and
to
him
belongs
the
credit
for
taking
the
first
step
toward
regularizing
this
method
of
on
august
24
first
partisan
detachment
was
formed
and
then
others
were
the
further
the
campaign
progressed
the
more
numerous
these
detachments
the
irregulars
destroyed
the
great
army
they
gathered
the
fallen
leaves
that
dropped
of
themselves
from
that
withered
french
sometimes
shook
that
tree
by
when
the
french
were
fleeing
toward
there
were
hundreds
of
such
of
various
sizes
and
there
were
some
that
adopted
all
the
army
methods
and
had
and
the
comforts
of
others
consisted
solely
of
cossack
there
were
also
small
scratch
groups
of
foot
and
and
groups
of
peasants
and
landowners

party
which
captured
several
hundred
prisoners

the
course
of
a

there
was
the

of
a
village
who
slew
hundreds
of
the
the
partisan
warfare
flamed
up
most
fiercely
in
the
latter
days
of
its
first
period
had
when
the
partisans
amazed
at
their
own
feared
every
minute
to
be
surrounded
and
captured
by
the
and
hid
in
the
forests
without
hardly
daring
to
dismount
and
always
expecting
to
be
by
the
end
of
october
this
kind
of
warfare
had
taken
definite
it
had
become
clear
to
all
what
could
be
ventured
against
the
french
and
what
could
now
only
the
commanders
of
detachments
with
and
moving
according
to
rules
at
a
distance
from
the
still
regarded
many
things
as
the
small
bands
that
had
started
their
activities
long
before
and
had
already
observed
the
french
closely
considered
things
possible
which
the
commanders
of
the
big
detachments
did
not
dare
to
the
cossacks
and
peasants
who
crept
in
among
the
french
now
considered
everything
on
october
denisov
was
one
of
the
was
with
his
group
at
the
height
of
the
guerrilla
since
early
morning
he
and
his
party
had
been
on
the
all
day
long
he
had
been
watching
from
the
forest
that
skirted
the
highroad
a
large
french
convoy
of
cavalry
baggage
and
russian
prisoners
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
was
learned
from
spies
and
moving
under
a
strong
escort
to
besides
denisov
and
dolokhov
also
led
a
small
party
and
moved
in
the
commanders
of
some
large
divisions
with
staffs
also
knew
of
this
convoy
as
denisov
expressed
were
sharpening
their
teeth
for
two
of
the
commanders
of
large
a
pole
and
the
other
a
invitations
to
denisov
almost
requesting
him
to
join
up
with
their
divisions
to
attack
the
i
have
gwown
mustaches
said
denisov
on
reading
these
and
he
wrote
to
the
german
despite
his
heartfelt
desire
to
serve
under
so
valiant
and
renowned
a
he
had
to
forgo
that
pleasure
because
he
was
already
under
the
command
of
the
polish
to
the
polish
general
he
replied
to
the
same
informing
him
that
he
was
already
under
the
command
of
the
having
arranged
matters
denisov
and
dolokhov
without
reporting
matters
to
the
higher
to
attack
and
seize
that
convoy
with
their
own
small
on
october
22
it
was
moving
from
the
village
of
mikulino
to
that
of
to
the
left
of
the
road
between
mikulino
and
shamshevo
there
were
large
extending
in
some
places
up
to
the
road
itself
though
in
others
a
mile
or
more
back
from
through
these
forests
denisov
and
his
party
rode
all
sometimes
keeping
well
back
in
them
and
sometimes
coming
to
the
very
but
never
losing
sight
of
the
moving
that
cossacks
of
party
had
seized
and
carried
off
into
the
forest
two
wagons
loaded
with
cavalry
which
had
stuck
in
the
mud
not
far
from
mikulino
where
the
forest
ran
close
to
the
since
and
until
the
party
had
watched
the
movements
of
the
french
without
it
was
necessary
to
let
the
french
reach
shamshevo
quietly
without
alarming
them
and
after
joining
dolokhov
who
was
to
come
that
evening
to
a
consultation
at
a
hut
in
the
forest
less
than
a
mile
from
to
surprise
the
french
at
falling
like
an
avalanche
on
their
heads
from
two
and
rout
and
capture
them
all
at
one
in
their
more
than
a
mile
from
mikulino
where
the
forest
came
right
up
to
the
six
cossacks
were
posted
to
report
if
any
fresh
columns
of
french
should
show
beyond
dolokhov
was
to
observe
the
road
in
the
same
to
find
out
at
what
distance
there
were
other
french
they
reckoned
that
the
convoy
had
fifteen
hundred
denisov
had
two
and
dolokhov
might
have
as
many
but
the
disparity
of
numbers
did
not
deter
all
that
he
now
wanted
to
know
was
what
troops
these
were
and
to
learn
that
he
had
to
capture
a
a
man
from
the
enemy
that
attack
on
the
wagons
had
been
made
so
hastily
that
the
frenchmen
with
the
wagons
had
all
been
only
a
little
drummer
boy
had
been
taken
and
as
he
was
a
straggler
he
could
tell
them
nothing
definite
about
the
troops
in
that
denisov
considered
it
dangerous
to
make
a
second
attack
for
fear
of
putting
the
whole
column
on
the
so
he
sent
tikhon
a
peasant
of
his
to
shamshevo
to
try
and
seize
at
least
one
of
the
french
quartermasters
who
had
been
sent
on
in
chapter
iv
it
was
a
warm
rainy
autumn
the
sky
and
the
horizon
were
both
the
color
of
muddy
at
times
a
sort
of
mist
and
then
suddenly
heavy
slanting
rain
came
denisov
in
a
felt
cloak
and
a
sheepskin
cap
from
which
the
rain
ran
down
was
riding
a
thin
thoroughbred
horse
with
sunken
like
his
which
turned
its
head
and
laid
its
ears
he
shrank
from
the
driving
rain
and
gazed
anxiously
before
his
thin
face
with
its
thick
black
beard
looked
beside
denisov
rode
an
fellow
also
in
felt
cloak
and
sheepskin
and
riding
a
large
sleek
don
a
captain
of
esaul
lovayski
the
third
was
a
tall
man
as
straight
as
an
with
narrow
light
eyes
and
with
calm
satisfaction
in
his
face
and
though
it
was
impossible
to
say
in
what
the
peculiarity
of
the
horse
and
rider
yet
at
first
glance
at
the
esaul
and
denisov
one
saw
that
the
latter
was
wet
and
uncomfortable
and
was
a
man
mounted
on
a
while
looking
at
the
esaul
one
saw
that
he
was
as
comfortable
and
as
much
at
ease
as
always
and
that
he
was
not
a
man
who
had
mounted
a
but
a
man
who
was
one
with
his
a
being
consequently
possessed
of
twofold
a
little
ahead
of
them
walked
a
peasant
wet
to
the
skin
and
wearing
a
gray
peasant
coat
and
a
white
knitted
a
little
on
a
lean
kirghiz
mount
with
an
enormous
tail
and
mane
and
a
bleeding

a
young
officer
in
a
blue
french
beside
him
rode
an

a
boy
in
a
tattered
french
uniform
and
blue
cap
behind
him
on
the
crupper
of
his
the
boy
held
on
to
the
hussar
with
red

raising
his
eyebrows
gazed
about
him
with
this

the
french
drummer
boy
captured
that
behind
them
along
the
cutup
forest
road
came
hussars
in
threes

and
then
some
in

some

some

the

huddled
up
trying
not
to
so
as
to
warm
the
water
that
had
trickled
to
their
bodies

not

the

cold

was
leaking

he
struck

times

his

his

out
of
sorts
both
because
of
the
rain
and
also
from
hunger
of
them
had
eaten
anything
since
and
yet
more
because
he
still
had
no
news
from
dolokhov
and
the
man
sent
to
capture
a
had
not
hardly
be
another
such
chance
to
fall
on
a
transport
as
too
risky
to
attack
them
by
and
if
we
put
it
off
till
another
day
one
of
the
big
guerrilla
detachments
will
snatch
the

from

peering

to
see
a

from

coming
to

as
soon

petya
brightened

began
telling
him
how
he

how
a
certain
hussar
had
distinguished

denisov
told
the
esaul

the
dispatch

repetition

the

of

i
sent
him
to
capture
a
said
nodding
at
the
first
words
denisov
uttered
as
if
he
understood
it
though
he
really
did
not
understand
anything
of
tikhon
shcherbaty
was
one
of
the
most
indispensable
men
in
their
he
was
a
peasant
from
near
the
river
when
denisov
had
come
to
pokrovsk
at
the
beginning
of
his
operations
and
had
as
usual
summoned
the
village
elder
and
asked
him
what
he
knew
about
the
the
as
though
shielding
had
as
all
village
elders
that
he
had
neither
seen
nor
heard
anything
of
but
when
denisov
explained
that
his
purpose
was
to
kill
the
and
asked
if
no
french
had
strayed
that
the
elder
replied
that
some
had
really
been
at
their
but
that
tikhon
shcherbaty
was
the
only
man
who
dealt
with
such
denisov
had
tikhon
called
having
praised
him
for
his
said
a
few
words
in
the
presence
about
loyalty
to
the
tsar
and
the
country
and
the
hatred
of
the
french
that
all
sons
of
the
fatherland
should
do
the
french
any
said
evidently
frightened
by
only
fooled
about
with
the
lads
for
you
we
killed
a
score
or
so
of
but
we
did
no
harm
next
day
when
denisov
had
left
having
quite
forgotten
about
this
it
was
reported
to
him
that
tikhon
had
attached
himself
to
their
party
and
asked
to
be
allowed
to
remain
with
denisov
gave
orders
to
let
him
do
who
at
first
did
rough
laying
fetching
flaying
dead
and
so
soon
showed
a
great
liking
and
aptitude
for
partisan
at
night
he
would
go
out
for
booty
and
always
brought
back
french
clothing
and
and
when
told
to
would
bring
in
french
captives
denisov
then
relieved
him
from
drudgery
and
began
taking
him
with
him
when
he
went
out
on
expeditions
and
had
him
enrolled
among
the
tikhon
did
not
like
and
always
went
on
never
lagging
behind
the
he
was
armed
with
a
musketoon
he
carried
rather
as
a
a
pike
and
an
which
latter
he
used
as
a
wolf
uses
its
with
equal
ease
picking
fleas
out
of
its
fur
or
crunching
thick
tikhon
with
equal
accuracy
would
split
logs
with
blows
at
or
holding
the
head
of
the
ax
would
cut
thin
little
pegs
or
carve
in
party
he
held
a
peculiar
and
exceptional
when
anything
particularly
difficult
or
nasty
had
to
be
to
push
a
cart
out
of
the
mud
with
pull
a
horse
out
of
a
swamp
by
its
skin
slink
in
among
the
or
walk
more
than
thirty
miles
in
a
pointed
laughingly
at
hurt
that
as
strong
as
a
they
said
of
once
a
frenchman
tikhon
was
trying
to
capture
fired
a
pistol
at
him
and
shot
him
in
the
fleshy
part
of
the
that
wound
tikhon
treated
only
with
internal
and
external
applications
of
was
the
subject
of
the
liveliest
jokes
by
the
whole
in
which
tikhon
readily
never
gave
you
a
the
cossacks
would
banter
and
purposely
writhing
and
making
pretended
to
be
angry
and
swore
at
the
french
with
the
funniest
the
only
effect
of
this
incident
on
tikhon
was
that
after
being
wounded
he
seldom
brought
in
he
was
the
bravest
and
most
useful
man
in
the
no
one
found
more
opportunities
for
no
one
captured
or
killed
more
and
consequently
he
was
made
the
buffoon
of
all
the
cossacks
and
hussars
and
willingly
accepted
that
now
he
had
been
sent
by
denisov
overnight
to
shamshevo
to
capture
a
but
whether
because
he
had
not
been
content
to
take
only
one
frenchman
or
because
he
had
slept
through
the
he
had
crept
by
day
into
some
bushes
right
among
the
french
as
denisov
had
witnessed
from
had
been
detected
by
chapter
vi
after
talking
for
some
time
with
the
esaul
about
next
which
seeing
how
near
they
were
to
the

seemed
to
have
definitely
decided
denisov

horse

said
to

they
approached
the
watchhouse

into

long
legs
and
swinging
wearing
a
short
bast
and
a
kazan

light
he
had
a
musketoon
over
his
shoulder

an
ax

in
his
when

espied
denisov

hastily
threw
something
into
the

his
sodden
hat
by
its
floppy
and
approached
his

was
his
wrinkled
and
pockmarked
face
and
narrow
little
eyes
beamed
with

his
head
high

as

the
first

his
back
with
one

and
his
head

suddenly
his
whole
face
expanded
into
a
foolish
disclosing
a
gap
where
he
had
lost
a
tooth
was
why
he
was
called
denisov
and
petya
burst
into
a
peal
of
merry
laughter
in
which
tikhon
himself
but
he
was
a
regular
said

and
rode
all
the
way
to
the
watchhouse
in
silence
and
frowning
tikhon
followed
behind
and
petya
heard
the
cossacks
laughing
with
him
and
at
about
some
pair
of
boots
he
had
thrown
into
the
when
the
fit
of
laughter
that
had
seized
him
at
words
and
smile
had
passed
and
petya
realized
for
a
moment
that
this
tikhon
had
killed
a
he
felt
he
looked
round
at
the
captive
drummer
boy
and
felt
a
pang
in
his
but
this
uneasiness
lasted
only
a
he
felt
it
necessary
to
hold
his
head
to
brace
and
to
question
the
esaul
with
an
air
of
importance
about
that
he
might
not
be
unworthy
of
the
company
in
which
he
found
the
officer
who
had
been
sent
to
inquire
met
denisov
on
the
way
with
the
news
that
dolokhov
was
soon
coming
and
that
all
was
well
with
denisov
at
once
cheered
up
calling
petya
to
tell
me
about
chapter
vii
having
left
his
people
after
their
departure
from
joined
his
regiment
and
was
soon
taken
as
orderly
by
a
general
commanding
a
large
guerrilla
from
the
time
he
received
his
and
especially
since
he
had
joined
the
active
army
and
taken
part
in
the
battle
of
petya
had
been
in
a
constant
state
of
blissful
excitement
at
being
and
in
a
perpetual
ecstatic
hurry
not
to
miss
any
chance
to
do
something
really
he
was
highly
delighted
with
what
he
saw
and
experienced
in
the
but
at
the
same
time
it
always
seemed
to
him
that
the
really
heroic
exploits
were
being
performed
just
where
he
did
not
happen
to
and
he
was
always
in
a
hurry
to
get
where
he
was
when
on
the
of
october
his
general
expressed
a
wish
to
send
somebody
to
petya
begged
so
piteously
to
be
sent
that
the
general
could
not
but
when
dispatching
him
he
recalled
mad
action
at
the
battle
of
where
instead
of
riding
by
the
road
to
the
place
to
which
he
had
been
he
had
galloped
to
the
advanced
line
under
the
fire
of
the
french
and
had
there
twice
fired
his
so
now
the
general
explicitly
forbade
his
taking
part
in
any
action
whatever
of
that
was
why
petya
had
blushed
and
grown
confused
when
denisov
asked
him
whether
he
could
before
they
had
ridden
to
the
outskirts
of
the
forest
petya
had
considered
he
must
carry
out
his
instructions
strictly
and
return
at
but
when
he
saw
the
french
and
saw
tikhon
and
learned
that
there
would
certainly
be
an
attack
that
he
with
the
rapidity
with
which
young
people
change
their
that
the
whom
he
had
greatly
respected
till
was
a
rubbishy
that
denisov
was
a
the
esaul
a
and
tikhon
a
hero
and
that
it
would
be
shameful
for
him
to
leave
them
at
a
moment
of
it
was
already
growing
dusk
when
and
the
esaul
rode
up
to
the
in
the
twilight
saddled
horses
could
be
and
cossacks
and
hussars
who
had
rigged
up
rough
shelters
in
the
glade
and
were
kindling
glowing
fires
in
a
hollow
of
the
forest
where
the
french
could
not
see
the
in
the
passage
of
the
small
watchhouse
a
cossack
with
sleeves
rolled
up
was
chopping
some
in
the
room
three
officers
of
band
were
converting
a
door
into
a
petya
took
off
his
wet
gave
them
to
be
and
at
once
began
helping
the
officers
to
fix
up
the
dinner
in
ten
minutes
the
table
was
ready
and
a
napkin
spread
on
on
the
table
were
a
flask
of
white
roast
and
sitting
at
table
with
the
officers
and
tearing
the
fat
savory
mutton
with
his
down
which
the
grease
petya
was
in
an
ecstatic
childish
state
of
love
for
all
and
consequently
of
confidence
that
others
loved
him
in
the
same
then
what
do

said
he
to
all

my
staying
a
day

not
waiting

a

petya
ran
out
into
the
passage
to
his
cossack
and
brought
back
some
bags
which
contained
about
five
pounds
of
have
want

then
dismayed
lest
he
had
said
too
petya
stopped
and
he
tried
to
remember
whether
he
had
not
done
anything
else
that
was
and
running
over
the
events
of
the
day
he
remembered
the
french
drummer
capital
for
us
but
what
of
where
have
they
put
have
they
fed
they
hurt
his
he
but
having
caught
himself
saying
too
much
about
the
he
was
now
afraid
to
speak
might
he
a
boy
himself
and
so
he
pities
the
show
them
tomorrow
whether
a
will
it
seem
odd
if
i
petya
never
and
blushing
and
looking
anxiously
at
the
officers
to
see
if
they
appeared
he
i
call
in
that
boy
who
was
taken
prisoner
and
give
him
something
to
a
poor
little
said
who
evidently
saw
nothing
shameful
in
this
him
his
name
is
vincent
have
him
call
said
call
a
poor
little
denisov
petya
was
standing
at
the
door
when
denisov
said
he
slipped
in
between
the
came
close
to
and
me
kiss
dear
old
how
how
and
having
kissed
denisov
he
ran
out
of
the
petya
stopping
outside
the
do
you
asked
a
voice
in
the
petya
replied
that
he
wanted
the
french
lad
who
had
been
captured
that
said
a
the
had
already
been
changed
by
the
cossacks
into
vesenny
and
into
vesenya
by
the
peasants
and
in
both
these
adaptations
the
reference
to
spring
matched
the
impression
made
by
the
young
is
warming
himself
there
by
the
laughing
voices
were
heard
calling
to
one
another
in
the
a
smart
said
an
hussar
standing
near
gave
him
something
to
eat
a
while
he
was
awfully
the
sound
of
bare
feet
splashing
through
the
mud
was
heard
in
the
and
the
drummer
boy
came
to
the
said
pas
on
ne
vous
fera
pas
de
he
added
shyly
and
touching
the
do
you
want
something
to
be
they
hurt
come
said
the
drummer
boy
in
a
trembling
almost
childish
and
he
began
scraping
his
dirty
feet
on
the
there
were
many
things
petya
wanted
to
say
to
the
drummer
but
did
not
dare
he
stood
irresolutely
beside
him
in
the
then
in
the
darkness
he
took
the
hand
and
pressed
come
he
repeated
in
a
gentle
what
can
i
do
for
he
and
opening
the
door
he
let
the
boy
pass
in
when
the
boy
had
entered
the
petya
sat
down
at
a
distance
from
considering
it
beneath
his
dignity
to
pay
attention
to
but
he
fingered
the
money
in
his
pocket
and
wondered
whether
it
would
seem
ridiculous
to
give
some
to
the
drummer
chapter
viii
the
arrival
of
dolokhov
diverted
attention
from
the

to
whom
denisov
had
had
some
mutton
and
vodka
and
whom
he
had
had
dressed
in
a
russian
coat
so
that
he
might
be
kept
with
their
band
and
not
sent
away
with
the
other
petya
had
heard
in
the
army
many
stories
of
extraordinary
bravery
and
of
his
cruelty
to
the
so
from
the
moment
he
entered
the
hut
petya
did
not
take
his
eyes
from
but
braced
himself
up
more
and
more
and
held
his
head
that
he
might
not
be
unworthy
even
of
such
appearance
amazed
petya
by
its
denisov
wore
a
cossack
had
a
had
an
icon
of
nicholas
the
on
his
and
his
way
of
speaking
and
everything
he
did
indicated
his
unusual
but
who
in
moscow
had
worn
a
persian
had
now
the
appearance
of
a
most
correct
officer
of
the
he
was
and
wore
a
padded
coat
with
an
order
of
george
at
his
buttonhole
and
a
plain
forage
cap
set
straight
on
his
he
took
off
his
wet
felt
cloak
in
a
corner
of
the
and
without
greeting
anyone
went
up
to
denisov
and
began
questioning
him
about
the
matter
in
denisov
told
him
of
the
designs
the
large
detachments
had
on
the
of
the
message
petya
had
and
his
own
replies
to
both
then
he
told
him
all
he
knew
of
the
french
but
we
must
know
what
troops
they
are
and
their
said
will
be
necessary
to
go
we
start
the
affair
without
knowing
for
certain
how
many
there
i
like
to
work
here
one
of
these
gentlemen
like
to
ride
over
to
the
french

no
need
for

go
at
said
addressing
as
for

let
him
go
on
any
like
exclaimed
i
you
must
excuse
i
shall
and
take
he
turning
to
dolokhov
answered
scrutinizing
the
face
of
the
french
drummer
you
had
that
youngster
with
you
he
asked

taken
today
but
he
knows
keeping
him
with
and
where
do
you
put
the
inquired
i
send
them
away
and
take
a
weceipt
for
shouted
suddenly
i
say
boldly
that
i
have
not
a
single
life
on
my
would
it
be
difficult
for
you
to
send
thirty
or
thwee
hundwed
men
to
town
under
instead
of
speak
staining
the
honor
of
a
kind
of
amiable
talk
would
be
suitable
from
this
young
count
of
said
dolokhov
with
cold
time
for
you
to
drop
not
said
i
only
say
that
certainly
go
with
said
petya
for
you
and
old
time
to
drop
these
continued
as
if
he
found
particular
pleasure
in
speaking
of
this
subject
which
irritated
why
have
you
kept
this
he
went
swaying
his
you
are
sorry
for
we
know
those
of
you
send
a
hundred
men
and
thirty
get
the
rest
either
starve
or
get
so
it
all
the
same
not
to
send
the
screwing
up
his
nodded
not
the
not
going
to
discuss
the
i
do
not
wish
to
take
it
on
my
you
say
all
only
not
by
my
dolokhov
began
has
told
them
not
to
capture
me
these
twenty
times
but
if
they
did
catch
me
string
me
up
to
an
aspen
and
with
all
your
chivalry
just
the
he
we
must
get
to
tell
the
cossack
to
fetch
my
i
have
two
french
uniforms
in
are
you
coming
with
he
asked
cried
blushing
almost
to
tears
and
glancing
at
while
dolokhov
had
been
disputing
with
denisov
what
should
be
done
with
petya
had
once
more
felt
awkward
and
but
again
he
had
no
time
to
grasp
fully
what
they
were
talking
distinguished
men
think
it
must
be
necessary
and
thought
above
all
denisov
must
not
dare
to
imagine
that
obey
him
and
that
he
can
order
me
i
will
certainly
go
to
the
french
camp
with
if
he
so
can
and
to
all
petya
replied
that
he
too
was
accustomed
to
do
everything
accurately
and
not
just
and
that
he
never
considered
personal
admit
that
if
we
know
for
sure
how
many
of
them
there
hundreds
of
lives
may
depend
on
while
there
are
only
two
of
i
want
to
go
very
much
and
certainly
will
so

chapter
ix
having
put
on
french
greatcoats
and
petya
and
dolokhov
rode
to
the
clearing
from
which
denisov
had
reconnoitered
the
french
and
emerging
from
the
forest
in
pitch
darkness
they
descended
into
the
on
reaching
the
dolokhov
told
the
cossacks
accompanying
him
to
await
him
there
and
rode
on
at
a
quick
trot
along
the
road
to
the
his
heart
in
his
mouth
with

by
his
i
be
taken
i
have
a
whispered
talk
said
dolokhov
in
a
hurried
and
at
that
very
moment
they
heard
through
the
darkness
the
and
the
click
of
a
goes
the
blood
rushed
to
face
and
he
grasped
his

neither
hastening
nor
slackening

of
the

the
black
figure
of
a
sentinel
stood
on
the

reined
in
his
horse
and
advanced
at
a

repeated
the
barring

not
un

dolokhov
suddenly
flaring
up
and
riding

at

an

making
his
sentinels
ask
him
for

i
am
asking
you
if
the
colonel
is
and
without
waiting
for
an
answer
from
the
who
had
stepped
dolokhov
rode
up
the
incline
at
a
noticing
the
black
outline
of
a
man
crossing
the
dolokhov
stopped
him
and
inquired
where
the
commander
and
officers
the
a
soldier
with
a
sack
over
his
came
close
up
to
touched
it
with
his
and
explained
simply
and
in
a
friendly
way
that
the
commander
and
the
officers
were
higher
up
the
hill
to
the
right
in
the
courtyard
of
the
as
he
called
the
having
ridden
up
the
on
both
sides
of
which
french
talk
could
be
heard
around
the
dolokhov
turned
into
the
courtyard
of
the
having
ridden
he
dismounted
and
approached
a
big
blazing
around
which
sat
several
men
talking
something
was
boiling
in
a
small
cauldron
at
the
edge
of
the
fire
and
a
soldier
in
a
peaked
cap
and
blue
lit
up
by
the
was
kneeling
beside
it
stirring
its
contents
with
a
a
hard
nut
to
said
one
of
the
officers
who
was
sitting
in
the
shadow
at
the
other
side
of
the
make
them
get
a
move
those
said
both
fell
peering
out
through
the
darkness
at
the
sound
of
and
steps
as
they
advanced
to
the
fire
leading
their
said
dolokhov
loudly
and
there
was
a
stir
among
the
officers
in
the
shadow
beyond
the
and
one
walking
round
the
came
up
to
that
he
the
noticing
his
he
broke
off
short
with
a
greeted
dolokhov
as
a
asking
what
he
could
do
for
dolokhov
said
that
he
and
his
companion
were
trying
to
overtake
their
and
addressing
the
company
in
general
asked
whether
they
knew
anything
of
the
6th
none
of
them
knew
and
petya
thought
the
officers
were
beginning
to
look
at
him
and
dolokhov
with
hostility
and
for
some
seconds
all
were
you
were
counting
on
the
evening
you
have
come
too
said
a
voice
from
behind
the
fire
with
a
repressed
dolokhov
replied
that
they
were
not
hungry
and
must
push
on
farther
that
he
handed
the
horses
over
to
the
soldier
who
was
stirring
the
pot
and
squatted
down
on
his
heels
by
the
fire
beside
the
officer
with
the
long
that
officer
did
not
take
his
eyes
from
dolokhov
and
again
asked
to
what
regiment
he
as
if
he
had
not
heard
the
did
not
but
lighting
a
short
french
pipe
which
he
took
from
his
pocket
began
asking
the
officer
in
how
far
the
road
before
them
was
safe
from
brigands
are
replied
an
officer
from
behind
the
dolokhov
remarked
that
the
cossacks
were
a
danger
only
to
stragglers
such
as
his
companion
and
probably
they
would
not
dare
to
attack
large
he
added
no
one
now
come
petya
thought
every
moment
as
he
stood
by
the
campfire
listening
to
the
but
dolokhov
restarted
the
conversation
which
had
dropped
and
began
putting
direct
questions
as
to
how
many
men
there
were
in
the
how
many
and
how
many
asking
about
the
russian
prisoners
with
that
dolokhov
horrid
business
dragging
these
corpses
about
with
it
would
be
better
to
shoot
such
and
burst
into
loud
so
strange
that
petya
thought
the
french
would
immediately
detect
their
and
involuntarily
took
a
step
back
from
the
no
one
replied
a
word
to
and
a
french
officer
whom
they
could
not
see
lay
wrapped
in
a
rose
and
whispered
something
to
a
dolokhov
got
up
and
called
to
the
soldier
who
was
holding
their
they
bring
our
horses
or
thought
instinctively
drawing
nearer
to
the
horses

petya
wished
to
say
but
could
not
utter
a
the
officers
were
whispering
dolokhov
was
a
long
time
mounting
his
horse
which
would
not
stand
then
he
rode
out
of
the
yard
at
a
petya
rode
beside
longing
to
look
round
to
see
whether
or
not
the
french
were
running
after
but
not
daring
coming
out
onto
the
road
dolokhov
did
not
ride
back
across
the
open
but
through
the
at
one
spot
he
stopped
and
you
he
petya
recognized
the
sound
of
russian
voices
and
saw
the
dark
figures
of
russian
prisoners
round
their
when
they
had
descended
to
the
bridge
petya
and
dolokhov
rode
past
the
who
without
saying
a
word
paced
morosely
up
and
down
then
they
descended
into
the
hollow
where
the
cossacks
awaited
tell
the
first
shot
at

dolokhov
and
was
about
to
ride
but
petya
seized
hold
of
he
are
such
a
how
how
how
i
love
all
said
but
petya
did
not
let
go
of
him
and
dolokhov
saw
through
the
gloom
that
petya
was
bending
toward
him
and
wanted
to
kiss
dolokhov
kissed
turned
his
and
vanished
into

sat
awhile
in
the
hut
joyfully
recalling
the
details
of
his
expedition
and
vividly
picturing
to
himself
what
would
happen
next
noticing
that
denisov
was

rose
and
went
out
of
it
was
still
quite
dark
the
rain
was
but
drops
were
still
falling
from
the
near
the
hut
the
black
shapes
of
the
shanties
and
of
horses

together

be

in

dying
campfire
gleamed
not
all

and
hussars
were
here
and
amid
the
sounds
of
falling
drops
and
the
munching
of
the
horses
near
could
be
heard
low
voices
which
seemed
to
be
petya
came
peered
into
the
and
went
up
to
the
someone
was
snoring
under
and
around
them
stood
saddled
horses
munching
their
in
the
dark
petya
recognized
his
own
which
he
called
though
it
was
of

went
up
to
do
some
service
said
sniffing
its
nostrils
and
kissing

a
cossack

was
sitting
under

your
do
you
know
i
have
only
just
come
been
into
the
french
and
petya
gave
the
cossack
a
detailed
account
not
only
of
his
ride
but
also
of
his
and
why
he
considered
it
better
to
risk
his
life
than
to
act
you
should
get
some
sleep
said
the
i
am
used
to
said
the
flints
in

i
brought
some
with

to
get
a
closer

am
accustomed
to
doing
everything

i
likhachev
got
rummaged
in
his
and
soon
petya
heard
the
warlike
sound
of
steel
on
he
climbed
onto
the
wagon
and
sat
on
its
the
cossack
was
sharpening
the
saber
under
the
are
the
lads
asked
and
some
and
that
thrown
himself
down
there
in
the
fast
asleep
after
his
he
was
that
after
that
petya
remained
silent
for
a
long
listening
to
the
he
heard
footsteps
in
the
darkness
and
a
black
figure
are
you
asked
a
man
coming
up
to
the
this
said
the
whom
petya
took
to
be
an
the
cup
left
by
the
the
hussar
took
the
must
be
daylight
said
and
went
petya
ought
to
have
known
that
he
was
in
a
forest
with
guerrilla
less
than
a
mile
from
the
sitting
on
a
wagon
captured
from
the
french
beside
which
horses
were
that
under
it
likhachev
was
sitting
sharpening
a
saber
for
that
the
big
dark
blotch
to
the
right
was
the
and
the
red
blotch
below
to
the
left
was
the
dying
embers
of
a
that
the
man
who
had
come
for
the
cup
was
an
hussar
who
wanted
a
but
he
neither
knew
nor
waited
to
know
anything
of
all
he
was
in
a
fairy
kingdom
where
nothing
resembled
the
big
dark
blotch
might
really
be
the
hut
or
it
might
be
a
cavern
leading
to
the
very
depths
of
the
perhaps
the
red
spot
was
a
or
it
might
be
the
eye
of
an
enormous
perhaps
he
was
really
sitting
on
a
but
it
might
very
well
be
that
he
was
not
sitting
on
a
wagon
but
on
a
terribly
high
tower
from
if
he
he
would
have
to
fall
for
a
whole
day
or
a
whole
or
go
on
falling
and
never
reach
the
perhaps
it
was
just
the
who
was
sitting
under
the
but
it
might
be
the
most
most
splendid
man
in
the
whom
no
one
knew
it
might
really
have
been
that
the
hussar
came
for
water
and
went
back
into
the
but
perhaps
he
had
simply
altogether
and
dissolved
into
nothing
petya
could
have
seen
now
would
have
surprised
he
was
in
a
fairy
kingdom
where
everything
was
he
looked
up
at
the
and
the
sky
was
a
fairy
realm
like
the
it
was
and
over
the
tops
of
the
trees
clouds
were
swiftly
sailing
as
if
unveiling
the
sometimes
it
looked
as
if
the
clouds
were
and
a
clear
black
sky
sometimes
it
seemed
as
if
the
black
spaces
were
sometimes
the
sky
seemed
to
be
rising
high
and
then
it
seemed
to
sink
so
low
that
one
could
touch
it
with
eyes
began
to
close
and
he
swayed
a
the
trees
were
quiet
talking
was
the
horses
neighed
and
jostled
one
someone
hissed
the
saber
against
the
and
suddenly
petya
heard
an
harmonious
orchestra
playing
some
sweetly
solemn
petya
was
as
musical
as
natasha
and
more
so
than
but
had
never
learned
music
or
thought
about
and
so
the
melody
that
unexpectedly
came
to
his
mind
seemed
to
him
particularly
fresh
and
the
music
became
more
and
more
the
melody
grew
and
passed
from
one
instrument
to
and
what
was
played
was
a
petya
had
not
the
least
conception
of
what
a
fugue
each
resembling
a
violin
and
now
a
but
better
and
clearer
than
violin
or
its
own
and
before
it
had
finished
the
melody
merged
with
another
instrument
that
began
almost
the
same
and
then
with
a
third
and
a
and
they
all
blended
into
one
and
again
became
separate
and
again
now
into
solemn
church
now
into
something
dazzlingly
brilliant
and
that
was
in
a
petya
said

the

lashed
his

galloped

at

became

as

with
from

of

galloped
and
the

thing
he

galloped
up
the

already
late
flashed
through

he
galloped
on
to
the

from
which
the
rapid
firing
could
be
the
shots
came
from
the
yard
of
the
house

had
visited

there
behind
a

in

thickly
overgrown
with

were
firing
at

crowded
at
the

he
approached
the

saw
whose
face
was
of
a
shouting
to
his
wait
for
the
he
exclaimed
as
petya
rode
up
to
shouted
and
without
pausing
a
moment
galloped
to
the
place
whence
came
the
sounds
of
firing
and
where
the
smoke
was
a
volley
was
and
some
bullets
whistled
while
others
plashed
against

of

down
their

ran
down

along

jerked
rapidly

his
head
was

pierced

speaking
to

to

if
the

afforded
him

symptoms
of
disorder
that

had
noticed
at
their
first
halting

after
leaving
moscow
had
now
reached
the
utmost
the
road
along
which
they
moved
was
bordered
on
both
sides
by
dead
ragged
men
who
had
fallen

regiments

times
during

false
alarms
had
been
given
and
the
soldiers
of
the
escort
had
raised
their
and
run
crushing

but
had
afterwards
reassembled
and
abused
each

for
their

groups
traveling

the

of

constituted
a
separate
and
united
though
each
of
the
groups
was
rapidly
melting
of
the
artillery

which
had
consisted
of
a
hundred
and
twenty
not
more
than
sixty
now
the
rest
had
been
captured
or
left
some
of
wagons
also
had
been
captured
or
three
wagons
had
been
raided
and
robbed
by
stragglers
from
from
the
talk
of
the
germans
pierre
learned
that
a
larger
guard
had
been
allotted
to
that
baggage
train
than
to
the
and
that
one
of
their
a
german
had
been
shot
by
the
own
order
because
a
silver
spoon
belonging
to
the
marshal
had
been
found
in
his
the
group
of
prisoners
had
melted
away
most
of
of
the
three
hundred
and
thirty
men
who
had
set
out
from
moscow
fewer
than
a
hundred
now
the
prisoners
were
more
burdensome
to
the
escort
than
even
the
cavalry
saddles
or
they
understood
that
the
saddles
and
spoon
might
be
of
some
but
that
cold
and
hungry
soldiers
should
have
to
stand
and
guard
equally
cold
and
hungry
russians
who
froze
and
lagged
behind
on
the
road
which
case
the
order
was
to
shoot
was
not
merely
incomprehensible
but
and
the
as
if
in
the
grievous
condition
they
themselves
were
of
giving
way
to
the
pity
they
felt
for
the
prisoners
and
so
rendering
their
own
plight
still
treated
them
with
particular
moroseness

after
the
third
stage

had
rejoined
karataev
and
the
dog
that
had
chosen
karataev
for
its
on
the
third
day
after
leaving
moscow
karataev
again
fell
ill
with
the
fever
he
had
suffered
from
in
the
hospital
in
and
as
he
grew
gradually
weaker
pierre
kept
away
from
pierre
did
not
know
but
since
karataev
had
begun
to
grow
weaker
it
had
cost
him
an
effort
to
go
near
when
he
did
so
and
heard
the
subdued
moaning
with
which
karataev
generally
lay
down
at
the
halting
and
when
he
smelled
the
odor
emanating
from
him
which
was
now
stronger
than
pierre
moved
farther
away
and
did
not
think
about
while
imprisoned
in
the
shed
pierre
had
learned
not
with
his
intellect
but
with
his
whole
by
life
that
man
is
created
for
that
happiness
is
within
in
the
satisfaction
of
simple
human
and
that
all
unhappiness
arises
not
from
privation
but
from
and
now
during
these
last
three
weeks
of
the
march
he
had
learned
still
another
consolatory
nothing
in
this
world
is
he
had
learned
that
as
there
is
no
condition
in
which
man
can
be
happy
and
entirely
so
there
is
no
condition
in
which
he
need
be
unhappy
and
lack
he
learned
that
suffering
and
freedom
have
their
limits
and
that
those
limits
are
very
near
that
the
person
in
a
bed
of
roses
with
one
crumpled
petal
suffered
as
keenly
as
he
sleeping
on
the
bare
damp
earth
with
one
side
growing
chilled
while
the
other
was
and
that
when
he
had
put
on
tight
dancing
shoes
he
had
suffered
just
as
he
did
now
when
he
walked
with
bare
feet
that
were
covered
with
footgear
having
long
since
fallen
to
he
discovered
that
when
he
had
married
his
his
own
free
will
as
it
had
seemed
to
had
been
no
more
free
than
now
when
they
locked
him
up
at
night
in
a
of
all
that
he
himself
subsequently
termed
his
but
which
at
the
time
he
scarcely
the
worst
was
the
state
of
his
and
horseflesh
was
appetizing
and
the
saltpeter
flavor
of
the
gunpowder
they
used
instead
of
salt
was
even
there
was
no
great
it
was
always
warm
walking
in
the
and
at
night
there
were
the
the
lice
that
devoured
him
warmed
his
the
one
thing
that
was
at
first
hard
to
bear
was
his
after
the
second
march
having
examined
his
feet
by
the
thought
it
would
be
impossible
to
walk
on
but
when
everybody
got
up
he
went
when
he
had
warmed
walked
without
feeling
the
though
at
night
his
feet
were
more
terrible
to
look
at
than
he
did
not
look
at
them
but
thought
of
other
only
now
did
pierre
realize
the
full
strength
of
life
in
man
and
the
saving
power
he
has
of
transferring
his
attention
from
one
thing
to
which
is
like
the
safety
valve
of
a
boiler
that
allows
superfluous
steam
to
blow
off
when
the
pressure
exceeds
a
certain
he
did
not
see
and
did
not
hear
how
they
shot
the
prisoners
who
lagged
though
more
than
a
hundred
perished
in
that
he
did
not
think
of
karataev
who
grew
weaker
every
day
and
evidently
would
soon
have
to
share
that
still
less
did
pierre
think
about
the
harder
his
position
became
and
the
more
terrible
the
the
more
independent
of
that
position
in
which
he
found
himself
were
the
joyful
and
comforting
and
imaginings
that
came
to
chapter
xiii
at
midday
on
the
of
october
pierre
was
going
uphill
along
the
slippery
looking
at
his
feet
and
at
the
roughness
of
the
occasionally
he
glanced
at
the
familiar
crowd
around
him
and
then
again
at
his
the
former
and
the
latter
were
alike
familiar
and
his
the
bandy
legged
dog
ran
merrily
along
the
side
of
the
sometimes
in
proof
of
its
agility
and
lifting
one
hind
leg
and
hopping
along
on
and
then
again
going
on
all
four
and
rushing
to
bark
at
the
crows
that
sat
on
the
the
dog
was
merrier
and
sleeker
than
it
had
been
in
all
around
lay
the
flesh
of
different
men
to
various
stages
of
and
as
the
wolves
were
kept
off
by
the
passing
men
the
dog
could
eat
all
it
it
had
been
raining
since
morning
and
had
seemed
as
if
at
any
moment
it
might
cease
and
the
sky
but
after
a
short
break
it
began
raining
harder
than
the
saturated
road
no
longer
absorbed
the
which
ran
along
the
ruts
in
pierre
walked
looking
from
side
to
counting
his
steps
in
and
reckoning
them
off
on
his
mentally
addressing
the
he
now
go
pelt
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
thinking
of
but
far
down
and
deep
within
him
his
soul
was
occupied
with
something
important
and
this
something
was
a
most
subtle
spiritual
deduction
from
a
conversation
with
karataev
the
day
at
their
halting
feeling
chilly
by
a
dying
pierre
had
got
up
and
gone
to
the
next
which
was
burning
there
platon
karataev
was
sitting
covered
and
his
greatcoat
as
if
it
were
a
telling
the
soldiers
in
his
effective
and
pleasant
though
now
feeble
voice
a
story
pierre
it
was
already
past
the
hour
when
karataev
was
usually
free
of
his
fever
and
particularly
when
pierre
reached
the
fire
and
heard
voice
enfeebled
by
and
saw
his
pathetic
face
brightly
lit
up
by
the
he
felt
a
painful
prick
at
his
his
feeling
of
pity
for
this
man
frightened
him
and
he
wished
to
go
but
there
was
no
other
and
pierre
sat
trying
not
to
look
at
how
are
he
am
if
we
grumble
at
god
grant
us
replied
and
at
once
resumed
the
story
he
had
he
with
a
smile
on
his
pale
emaciated
face
and
a
particularly
happy
light
in
his
pierre
had
long
been
familiar
with
that
karataev
had
told
it
to
him
alone
some
times
and
always
with
a
specially
joyful
but
well
as
he
knew
pierre
now
listened
to
that
tale
as
to
something
and
the
quiet
rapture
karataev
evidently
felt
as
he
told
it
communicated
itself
also
to
the
story

of
an
old
merchant
who
lived
a
good
and

throat
a
bloodstained
knife
was
found
under
the
old

was
and
his
nostrils
having
been
torn
in
due
as
karataev
put
he
was
sent
to
hard
labor

at
this
point

old

doing
no

one
night
the
convicts
were
gathered
just

he
had
taken

he
wept
bitter
and
what
do
you
dear
karataev
his
face
brightening
more
and
more
with
a
rapturous
smile
as
if
what
he
now
had
to
tell
contained
the
chief
charm
and
the
whole
meaning
of
his
do

confessed
and
it
was
all
written
down
and
the
papers
sent
off
in
due
the
place
was
a
long
way
and
while
they
were
what
with
one
thing
and
filling
in
the
papers
all
in
due
authorities
i
the
affair
reached
the
after
a
while
the
decree
to
set
the
merchant
free
and
give
him
a
compensation
that
had
been
the
paper
arrived
and
they
began
to
look
for
the
old
is
the
old
man
who
has
been
suffering
innocently
and
in
a
paper
has
come
from
the
so
they
began
looking
for
here
lower
jaw
god
had
already
forgiven
was
how
it
dear
karataev
concluded
and
sat
for
a
long
time
gazing
before
him
with
a
and
soul
was
dimly
but
joyfully
filled
not
by
the
story
itself
but
by
its
mysterious
by
the
rapturous
joy
that
lit
up
face
as
he
told
and
the
mystic
significance
of
that
chapter
xiv
vos
suddenly
cried
a
your
a
pleasant
feeling
of
excitement
and
an
expectation
of
something
joyful
and
solemn
was
aroused
among
the
soldiers
of
the
convoy
and
the
from
all
sides
came
shouts
of
and
from
the
left
came
smartly
dressed
cavalrymen
on
good
passing
the
prisoners
at
a
the
expression
on
all
faces
showed
the
tension
people
feel
at
the
approach
of
those
in
the
prisoners
thronged
together
and
were
pushed
off
the
the
convoy
formed
the
the
the
and
hardly
had
the
sleek
cavalry
before
a
carriage
drawn
by
six
gray
horses
rattled
pierre
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
man
in
a
hat
with
a
tranquil
look
on
his
white
it
was
one
of
the
his
eye
fell
on
large
and
striking
and
in
the
expression
with
which
he
frowned
and
looked
away
pierre
thought
he
detected
sympathy
and
a
desire
to
conceal
that
the
general
in
charge
of
the
stores
galloped
after
the
carriage
with
a
red
and
frightened
whipping
up
his
skinny
several
officers
formed
a
group
and
some
soldiers
crowded
round
their
faces
all
looked
excited
and
did
he
what
did
he
pierre
heard
them
while
the
marshal
was
the
prisoners
had
huddled
together
in
a
and
pierre
saw
karataev
whom
he
had
not
yet
seen
that
he
sat
in
his
short
overcoat
leaning
against
a
birch
on
his
besides
the
look
of
joyful
emotion
it
had
worn
yesterday
while
telling
the
tale
of
the
merchant
who
suffered
there
was
now
an
expression
of
quiet
karataev
looked
at
pierre
with
his
kindly
round
eyes
now
filled
with
evidently
wishing
him
to
come
near
that
he
might
say
something
to
but
pierre
was
not
sufficiently
sure
of
he
made
as
if
he
did
not
notice
that
look
and
moved
hastily
when
the
prisoners
again
went
forward
pierre
looked
karataev
was
still
sitting
at
the
side
of
the
road
under
the
birch
tree
and
two
frenchmen
were
talking
over
his
pierre
did
not
look
round
again
but
went
limping
up
the
from
where
karataev
had
been
came
the
sound
of
a
pierre
heard
it
but
at
that
moment
he
remembered
that
he
had
not
yet
finished
reckoning
up
how
many
stages
still
remained
to
calculation
he
had
begun
before
the
marshal
went
and
he
again
started
two
french
soldiers
ran
past
one
of
whom
carried
a
lowered
and
smoking
they
both
looked
and
in
the
expression
on
their
of
them
glanced
timidly
at
there
was
something
resembling
what
he
had
seen
on
the
face
of
the
young
soldier
at
the
pierre
looked
at
the
soldier
and
remembered
two
days
that
man
had
burned
his
shirt
while
drying
it
at
the
fire
and
how
they
had
laughed
at
behind
where
karataev
had
been
the
dog
began
to
a
stupid
why
is
it
thought
his
the
prisoner
soldiers
walking
beside
avoided
looking
back
at
the
place
where
the
shot
had
been
fired
and
the
dog
was
just
as
pierre
but
there
was
a
set
look
on
all
their
chapter
xv
the
the
and
the
baggage
train
stopped
at
the
village
of
the
men
crowded
together
round
the
pierre
went
up
to
the
ate
some
roast
lay
down
with
his
back
to
the
and
immediately
fell
he
again
slept
as
he
had
done
at
mozhaysk
after
the
battle
of
again
real
events
mingled
with
dreams
and
again
he
or
gave
expression
to
his
and
even
to
the
same
thoughts
that
had
been
expressed
in
his
dream
at
is
life
is
everything
changes
and
moves
and
that
movement
is
and
while
there
is
life
there
is
joy
in
consciousness
of
the
to
love
life
is
to
love
harder
and
more
blessed
than
all
else
is
to
love
this
life
in
in
innocent
came
to
and
suddenly
he
saw
vividly
before
him
a
kindly
old
man
who
had
given
him
geography
lessons
in
a
said
the
old
and
showed
pierre
a
this
globe
was
vibrating
ball
without
fixed
its
whole
surface
consisted
of
drops
closely
pressed
and
all
these
drops
moved
and
changed
sometimes
several
of
them
merging
into
sometimes
one
dividing
into
each
drop
tried
to
spread
out
and
occupy
as
much
space
as
but
others
striving
to
do
the
same
compressed
sometimes
destroyed
and
sometimes
merged
with
is
said
the
old
simple
and
clear
it
thought
is
it
i
did
not
know
it
is
in
the
and
each
drop
tries
to
expand
so
as
to
reflect
him
to
the
greatest
and
it
disappears
from
the
sinks
to
the
and
again
there
karataev
has
spread
out
and
do
you
my
said
the
you
damn
shouted
a
and
pierre
woke
he
lifted
himself
and
sat
a
frenchman
who
had
just
pushed
a
russian
soldier
away
was
squatting
by
the
engaged
in
roasting
a
piece
of
meat
stuck
on
a
his
sleeves
were
rolled
up
and
his
red
hands
with
their
short
fingers
deftly
turned
the
his
brown
morose
face
with
frowning
brows
was
clearly
visible
by
the
glow
of
the
all
the
same
to
he
turning
quickly
to
a
soldier
who
stood
behind
get
and
twisting
the
ramrod
he
looked
gloomily
at
who
turned
away
and
gazed
into
the
a
the
russian
soldier
the
frenchman
had
pushed
was
sitting
near
the
fire
patting
something
with
his
looking
more
closely
pierre
recognized
the
sitting
beside
the
wagging
its
said
he
but
did
not
suddenly
and
simultaneously
a
crowd
of
memories
awoke
in
his
the
look
platon
had
given
him
as
he
sat
under
the
of
the
shot
heard
from
that
of
the
of
the
guilty
faces
of
the
two
frenchmen
as
they
ran
past
of
the
lowered
and
smoking
and
of
absence
at
this
he
was
on
the
point
of
realizing
that
karataev
had
been
but
just
at
that
he
knew
not
the
recollection
came
to
his
mind
of
a
summer
evening
he
had
spent
with
a
beautiful
polish
lady
on
the
veranda
of
his
house
in
and
without
linking
up
the
events
of
the
day
or
drawing
a
conclusion
from
pierre
closed
his
seeing
a
vision
of
the
country
in
summertime
mingled
with
memories
of
bathing
and
of
the
vibrating
and
he
sank
into
water
so
that
it
closed
over
his
before
sunrise
he
was
awakened
by
shouts
and
loud
and
rapid
french
soldiers
were
running
past
one
of
them
and
a
moment
later
a
crowd
of
russians
surrounded
for
a
long
time
he
could
not
understand
what
was
happening
to
all
around
he
heard
his
comrades
sobbing
with
dear
old
soldiers
as
they
embraced
cossacks
and
the
hussars
and
cossacks
crowded
round
the
one
offered
them
another
and
a
third

he
sat
among

could
not
utter

talking
loudly
among
but
as
they
passed
dolokhov
who
gently
switched
his
boots
with
his
whip
and
watched
them
with
cold
glassy
eyes
that
boded

became

the
opposite

counting
the

marking
off

a

asked
the
second
replied
the
dolokhov
kept
having
adopted
this
expression
from
the
and
when
his
eyes
met
those
of
the
prisoners
they
flashed
with
a
cruel
get
bareheaded
and
with
a
gloomy
walked
behind
some
cossacks
who
were
carrying
the
body
of
petya
rostov
to
a
hole
that
had
been
dug
in
the
chapter
xvi
after
the
of
october
when
the
frosts
the
flight
of
the
french
assumed
a
still
more
tragic
with
men
or
roasting
themselves
to
death
at
the
while

with
people
dressed
in
furs
continued
to
drive
carrying
away

property
that
had
been
stolen
by

the
movements
of
the
russian
and
french
armies
during
the
campaign
from
moscow
back
to
the
niemen
were
like
those
in
a
game
of
russian
in
which
two
players
are
blindfolded
and
one
of
them
occasionally
rings
a
little
bell
to
inform
the
catcher
of
his
first
he
rings
his
bell
but
when
he
gets
into
a
tight
place
he
runs
away
as
quietly
as
he
and
often
thinking
to
escape
runs
straight
into
his
at
first
while
they
were
still
moving
along
the

made
their
presence
but
later
when
they
reached
the
smolensk
road
they
ran
holding
the
clapper
of
their
bell
often
thinking
they
were
escaping
ran
right
into
the
owing
to
the
rapidity
of
the
french
flight
and
the
russian
pursuit
and
the
consequent
exhaustion
of

of
approximately

a

of
the

by
each
even
what
information
was

could
not
be
delivered
in
if
news
was
received
one
day
that
the

had
been
in
a
certain
position
the
day
by
the

day
when
something
could
have
been
that

was
already

farther
on

in
quite
another
one
army
fled
and
the
other
beyond
smolensk
there
were
several
different
roads
available
for
the

would
have
thought
that
during
their
stay
of
four
days
they
might
have
learned
where
the
enemy
might
have
arranged
some
more
advantageous
plan
and
undertaken
something
but
after

four
halt
the
with
no

or
again
began
running
along

beaten
neither
to
the

nor
to

along

through

would
have

have
been

by
the
historians
about
this

are

what
reading
the
account
of
the
last
part
of
the
campaign
of
has
not
experienced
an
uncomfortable
feeling
of
and
who
has
not
asked
himself
how
it
is
that
the
french
were
not
all
captured
or
destroyed
when
our
three
armies
surrounded
them
in
superior
when
the
disordered
hungry
and
surrendered
in
and
when
the
historians
the
aim
of
the
russians
was
to
stop
the
to
cut
them
and
capture
them
how
was
it
that
the
russian
which
when
numerically
weaker
than
the
french
had
given
battle
at
did
not
achieve
its
purpose
when
it
had
surrounded
the
french
on
three
sides
and
when
its
aim
was
to
capture
can
the
french
be
so
enormously
superior
to
us
that
when
we
had
surrounded
them
with
superior
forces
we
could
not
beat
how
could
that
history
what
is
called
by
that
replying
to
these
questions
says
that
this
occurred
because
kutuzov
and
tormasov
and
and
this
man
and
that
did
not
execute
such
and
such
but
why
did
they
not
execute
those
and
why
if
they
were
guilty
of
not
carrying
out
a
prearranged
plan
were
they
not
tried
and
but
even
if
we
admitted
that
and
others
were
the
cause
of
the
russian
it
is
still
incomprehensible
the
position
of
the
russian
army
being
what
it
was
at
krasnoe
and
at
the
berezina
both
cases
we
had
superior
the
french
army
with
its
and
emperor
was
not
if
that
was
what
the
russians
aimed
the
explanation
of
this
strange
fact
given
by
russian
military
historians
the
effect
that
kutuzov
hindered
an
is
for
we
know
that
he
could
not
restrain
the
troops
from
attacking
at
vyazma
and
why
was
the
russian
with
inferior
forces
had
withstood
the
enemy
in
full
strength
at
at
krasnoe
and
the
berezina
by
the
disorganized
crowds
of
the
french
when
it
was
numerically
if
the
aim
of
the
russians
consisted
in
cutting
off
and
capturing
napoleon
and
his
that
aim
was
not
merely
frustrated
but
all
attempts
to
attain
it
were
most
shamefully
this
last
period
of
the
campaign
is
quite
rightly
considered
by
the
french
to
be
a
series
of
and
quite
wrongly
considered
victorious
by
russian
the
russian
military
historians
in
so
far
as
they
submit
to
claims
of
logic
must
admit
that
and
in
spite
of
their
lyrical
rhapsodies
about
and
so
must
reluctantly
admit
that
the
french
retreat
from
moscow
was
a
series
of
victories
for
napoleon
and
defeats
for
but
putting
national
vanity
entirely
aside
one
feels
that
such
a
conclusion
involves
a
since
the
series
of
french
victories
brought
the
french
complete
while
the
series
of
russian
defeats
led
to
the
total
destruction
of
their
enemy
and
the
liberation
of
their
the
source
of
this
contradiction
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
historians
studying
the
events
from
the
letters
of
the
sovereigns
and
the
from
and
so
have
attributed
to
this
last
period
of
the
war
of
1812
an
aim
that
never
namely
that
of
cutting
off
and
capturing
napoleon
with
his
marshals
and
his
there
never
was
or
could
have
been
such
an
for
it
would
have
been
senseless
and
its
attainment
quite
it
would
have
been
first
because
disorganized
army
was
flying
from
russia
with
all
possible
that
is
to
was
doing
just
what
every
russian
so
what
was
the
use
of
performing
various
operations
on
the
french
who
were
running
away
as
fast
as
they
possibly
it
would
have
been
senseless
to
block
the
passage
of
men
whose
whole
energy
was
directed
to
it
would
have
been
senseless
to
sacrifice
own
troops
in
order
to
destroy
the
french
which
without
external
interference
was
destroying
itself
at
such
a
rate
though
its
path
was
not
it
could
not
carry
across
the
frontier
more
than
it
actually
did
in
namely
a
hundredth
part
of
the
original
it
would
have
been
senseless
to
wish
to
take
captive
the
and
capture
would
have
been
in
the
highest
degree
embarrassing
for
the
as
the
most
adroit
diplomatists
of
the
time
de
maistre
and
still
more
senseless
would
have
been
the
wish
to
capture
army
corps
of
the
when
our
own
army
had
melted
away
to
half
before
reaching
krasnoe
and
a
whole
division
would
have
been
needed
to
convoy
the
corps
of
and
when
our
men
were
not
always
getting
full
rations
and
the
prisoners
already
taken
were
perishing
of
all
the
profound
plans
about
cutting
off
and
capturing
napoleon
and
his
army
were
like
the
plan
of
a
market
gardener
when
driving
out
of
his
garden
a
cow
that
had
trampled
down
the
beds
he
had
should
run
to
the
gate
and
hit
the
cow
on
the
the
only
thing
to
be
said
in
excuse
of
that
gardener
would
be
that
he
was
very
but
not
even
that
could
be
said
for
those
who
drew
up
this
for
it
was
not
they
who
had
suffered
from
the
trampled
but
besides
the
fact
that
cutting
off
napoleon
with
his
army
would
have
been
it
was
it
was
impossible
first
experience
shows
that
a
movement
of
columns
on
a
battlefield
never
coincides
with
the
probability
of
and
wittgenstein
effecting
a
junction
on
time
at
an
appointed
place
was
so
remote
as
to
be
tantamount
to
as
in
fact
thought
who
when
he
received
the
plan
remarked
that
diversions
planned
over
great
distances
do
not
yield
the
desired
secondly
it
was
because
to
paralyze
the
momentum
with
which
army
was
incomparably
greater
forces
than
the
russians
possessed
would
have
been
thirdly
it
was
because
the
military
term
cut
has
no
one
can
cut
off
a
slice
of
but
not
an
to
cut
off
an
bar
its
quite
for
there
is
always
plenty
of
room
to
avoid
capture
and
there
is
the
night
when
nothing
can
be
as
the
military
scientists
might
convince
themselves
by
the
example
of
krasnoe
and
of
the
it
is
only
possible
to
capture
prisoners
if
they
agree
to
be
just
as
it
is
only
possible
to
catch
a
swallow
if
it
settles
on
men
can
only
be
taken
prisoners
if
they
surrender
according
to
the
rules
of
strategy
and
as
the
germans
but
the
french
troops
quite
rightly
did
not
consider
that
this
suited
since
death
by
hunger
and
cold
awaited
them
in
flight
or
captivity
fourthly
and
chiefly
it
was
because
never
since
the
world
began
has
a
war
been
fought
under
such
conditions
as
those
that
obtained
in
and
the
russian
army
in
its
pursuit
of
the
french
strained
its
strength
to
the
utmost
and
could
not
have
done
more
without
destroying
during
the
movement
of
the
russian
army
from
tarutino
to
krasnoe
it
lost
fifty
thousand
sick
or
that
is
a
number
equal
to
the
population
of
a
large
provincial
half
the
men
fell
out
of
the
army
without
a
and
it
is
of
this
period
of
the
the
army
lacked
boots
and
sheepskin
was
short
of
provisions
and
without
and
was
camping
out
at
night
for
months
in
the
snow
with
fifteen
degrees
of
when
there
were
only
seven
or
eight
hours
of
daylight
and
the
rest
was
night
in
which
the
influence
of
discipline
cannot
be
when
men
were
taken
into
that
region
of
death
where
discipline
not
for
a
few
hours
only
as
in
a
but
for
where
they
were
every
moment
fighting
death
from
hunger
and
when
half
the
army
perished
in
a
single
is
of
this
period
of
the
campaign
that
the
historians
tell
us
how
miloradovich
should
have
made
a
flank
march
to
such
and
such
a
tormasov
to
another
and
chichagov
should
have
crossed

how

the

so

so
the
half
of
whom
did
all
that
could
and
should
have
been
done
to
attain
an
end
worthy
of
the
and
they
are
not
to
blame
because
other
sitting
in
warm
proposed
that
they
should
do
what
was
all
that
strange
contradiction
now
difficult
to
understand
between
the
facts
and
the
historical
accounts
only
arises
because
the
historians
dealing
with
the
matter
have
written
the
history
of
the
beautiful
words
and
sentiments
of
various
and
not
the
history
of
the
to
them
the
words
of
miloradovich
seem
very
and
so
do
their
surmises
and
the
rewards
this
or
that
general
but
the
question
of
those
fifty
thousand
men
who
were
left
in
hospitals
and
in
graves
does
not
even
interest
for
it
does
not
come
within
the
range
of
their
yet
one
need
only
discard
the
study
of
the
reports
and
general
plans
and
consider
the
movement
of
those
hundreds
of
thousands
of
men
who
took
a
direct
part
in
the
and
all
the
questions
that
seemed
insoluble
easily
and
simply
receive
an
immediate
and
certain
the
aim
of
cutting
off
napoleon
and
his
army
never
existed
except
in
the
imaginations
of
a
dozen
it
could
not
exist
because
it
was
senseless
and
the
people
had
a
single
to
free
their
land
from
that
aim
was
attained
in
the
first
place
of
as
the
french
ran
and
so
it
was
only
necessary
not
to
stop
their
secondly
it
was
attained
by
the
guerrilla
warfare
which
was
destroying
the
and
thirdly
by
the
fact
that
a
large
russian
army
was
following
the
ready
to
use
its
strength
in
case
their
movement
the
russian
army
had
to
act
like
a
whip
to
a
running
and
the
experienced
driver
knew
it
was
better
to

with
still
greater
purity
and
clearness
what
they
were
both
but
pure
and
complete
sorrow
is
as
impossible
as
pure
and
complete
princess
in
her
position
as
absolute
and
independent
arbiter
of
her
own
fate
and
guardian
and
instructor
of
her
was
the
first
to
be
called
back
to
life
from
that
realm
of
sorrow
in
which
she
had
dwelt
for
the
first
she
received
letters
from
her
relations
to
which
she
had
to
the
room
in
which
little
nicholas
had
been
put
was
damp
and
he
began
to
alpatych
came
to
yaroslavl
with
reports
on
the
state
of
their
affairs
and
with
advice
and
suggestions
that
they
should
return
to
moscow
to
the
house
on
the
vozdvizhenka
which
had
remained
uninjured
and
needed
only
slight
life
did
not
stand
still
and
it
was
necessary
to
hard
as
it
was
for
princess
mary
to
emerge
from
the
realm
of
secluded
contemplation
in
which
she
had
lived
till
and
sorry
and
almost
ashamed
as
she
felt
to
leave
natasha
yet
the
cares
of
life
demanded
her
attention
and
she
involuntarily
yielded
to
she
went
through
the
accounts
with
conferred
with
dessalles
about
her
and
gave
orders
and
made
preparations
for
the
journey
to
natasha
remained
alone
from
the
time
princess
mary
began
making
preparations
for
held
aloof
from
her
princess
mary
asked
the
countess
to
let
natasha
go
with
her
to
and
both
parents
gladly
accepted
this
for
they
saw
their
daughter
losing
strength
every
day
and
thought
that
a
change
of
scene
and
the
advice
of
moscow
doctors
would
be
good
for
am
not
going
natasha
replied
when
this
was
proposed
to
please
just
leave
me
and
she
ran
out
of
the
with
difficulty
refraining
from
tears
of
vexation
and
irritation
rather
than
of
after
she
felt
herself
deserted
by
princes
mary
and
alone
in
her
natasha
spent
most
of
the
time
in
her
room
by
sitting
huddled
up
feet
and
all
in
the
corner
of
the
tearing
and
twisting
something
with
her
slender
nervous
fingers
and
gazing
intently
and
fixedly
at
whatever
her
eyes
chanced
to
fall
this
solitude
exhausted
and
tormented
her
but
she
was
in
absolute
need
of
as
soon
as
anyone
entered
she
got
up
changed
her
position
and
and
picked
up
a
book
or
some
evidently
waiting
impatiently
for
the
intruder
to
she
felt
all
the
time
as
if
she
might
at
any
moment
penetrate
that
on
a
terrible
questioning
too
great
for
her
spiritual
gaze
was
one
day
toward
the
end
of
december
pale
and
dressed
in
a
black
woolen
her
plaited
hair
negligently
twisted
into
a
was
crouched
feet
and
all
in
the
corner
of
her
nervously
crumpling
and
smoothing
out
the
end
of
her
sash
while
she
looked
at
a
corner
of
the
she
was
gazing
in
the
direction
in
which
he
had
the
other
side
of
and
that
other
side
of
of
which
she
had
never
before
thought
and
which
had
formerly
seemed
to
her
so
far
away
and
was
now
nearer
and
more
akin
and
more
comprehensible
than
this
side
of
where
everything
was
either
emptiness
and
desolation
or
suffering
and
she
was
gazing
where
she
knew
him
to
but
she
could
not
imagine
him
otherwise
than
as
he
had
been
she
now
saw
him
again
as
he
had
been
at
at
and
at
she
saw
his
heard
his
repeated
his
words
and
her
and
sometimes
devised
other
words
they
might
have
there
he
is
lying
back
in
an
armchair
in
his
velvet
leaning
his
head
on
his
thin
pale
his
chest
is
dreadfully
hollow
and
his
shoulders
his
lips
are
firmly
his
eyes
and
a
wrinkle
comes
and
goes
on
his
pale
one
of
his
legs
twitches
just
but
natasha
knows
that
he
is
struggling
with
terrible
is
that
pain
why
does
he
have
that
what
does
he
how
does
it
hurt
thought
he
noticed
her
watching
raised
his
and
began
to
speak
thing
would
be
said
bind
oneself
forever
to
a
suffering
it
would
be
continual
and
he
looked
searchingly
at
natasha
as
usual
answered
before
she
had
time
to
think
what
she
would
she
go
you
will
get
quite
she
now
saw
him
from
the
commencement
of
that
scene
and
relived
what
she
had
then
she
recalled
his
long
sad
and
severe
look
at
those
words
and
understood
the
meaning
of
the
rebuke
and
despair
in
that
protracted
natasha
now
said
to
it
would
be
dreadful
if
he
always
continued
to
i
said
it
then
only
because
it
would
have
been
dreadful
for
but
he
understood
it
he
thought
it
would
be
dreadful
for
he
then
still
wished
to
live
and
feared
and
i
said
it
so
awkwardly
and
i
did
not
say
what
i
i
thought
quite
had
i
said
what
i
i
should
have
even
if
he
had
to
go
on
to
die
continually
before
my
i
should
have
been
happy
compared
with
what
i
am
now
there
is
did
he
know
he
did
not
and
never
will
know
and
now
it
will
never
be
possible
to
put
it
and
now
he
again
seemed
to
be
saying
the
same
words
to
only
in
her
imagination
natasha
this
time
gave
him
a
different
she
stopped
him
and
for
but
not
for
you
know
that
for
me
there
is
nothing
in
life
but
and
to
suffer
with
you
is
the
greatest
happiness
for
and
he
took
her
hand
and
pressed
it
as
he
had
pressed
it
that
terrible
evening
four
days
before
his
and
in
her
imagination
she
said
other
tender
and
loving
words
which
she
might
have
said
then
but
only
spoke
love
i
she
convulsively
pressing
her
hands
and
setting
her
teeth
with
a
desperate
she
was
overcome
by
sweet
sorrow
and
tears
were
already
rising
in
her
then
she
suddenly
asked
herself
to
whom
she
was
saying
again
everything
was
shrouded
in
dry
and
again
with
a
strained
frown
she
peered
toward
the
world
where
he
and
now
it
seemed
to
her
she
was
penetrating
the
but
at
the
instant
when
it
seemed
that
the
incomprehensible
was
revealing
itself
to
her
a
loud
rattle
of
the
door
handle
struck
painfully
on
her
her
entered
the
room
quickly
and
abruptly
with
a
frightened
look
on
her
face
and
showing
no
concern
for
her
to
your
papa
at
said
she
with
a
excited
about
peter
a
she
finished
with
a
chapter
ii
besides
a
feeling
of
aloofness
from
everybody
natasha
was
feeling
a
special
estrangement
from
the
members
of
her
own
all
of
her
and
so
near
to
so
so
that
all
their
words
and
feelings
seemed
an
insult
to
the
world
in
which
she
had
been
living
of
and
she
felt
not
merely
indifferent
to
them
but
regarded
them
with
she
heard
words
about
peter
ilynich
and
a
but
did
not
grasp
what
misfortune
can
happen
to
they
just
live
their
own
and
commonplace
thought
as
she
entered
the
ballroom
her
father
was
hurriedly
coming
out
of
her
his
face
was
puckered
up
and
wet
with
he
had
evidently
run
out
of
that
room
to
give
vent
to
the
sobs
that
were
choking
when
he
saw
natasha
he
waved
his
arms
despairingly
and
burst
into
convulsively
painful
sobs
that
distorted
his
soft
round
is
and
weeping
like
a
child
and
quickly
shuffling
on
his
feeble
legs
to
a
he
almost
fell
into
covering
his
face
with
his
suddenly
an
electric
shock
seemed
to
run
through
whole
terrible
anguish
struck
her
she
felt
a
dreadful
ache
as
if
something
was
being
torn
inside
her
and
she
were
but
the
pain
was
immediately
followed
by
a
feeling
of
release
from
the
oppressive
constraint
that
had
prevented
her
taking
part
in
the
sight
of
her
the
terribly
wild
cries
of
her
mother
that
she
heard
through
the
made
her
immediately
forget
herself
and
her
own
she
ran
to
her
but
he
feebly
waved
his
pointing
to
her
princess
pale
and
with
quivering
came
out
from
that
room
and
taking
natasha
by
the
arm
said
something
to
natasha
neither
saw
nor
heard
she
went
in
with
rapid
pausing
at
the
door
for
an
instant
as
if
struggling
with
and
then
ran
to
her
the
countess
was
lying
in
an
armchair
in
a
strange
and
awkward
stretching
out
and
beating
her
head
against
the
sonya
and
the
maids
were
holding
her
cried
the
not
not
she
pushing
those
around
her
all
of
not
not
natasha
put
one
knee
on
the
stooped
over
her
embraced
and
with
unexpected
strength
raised
turned
her
face
toward
and
clung
to
i
am
my
dearest
she
kept
on
not
pausing
an
she
did
not
let
go
of
her
mother
but
struggled
tenderly
with
demanded
a
pillow
and
hot
and
unfastened
and
tore
open
her
dearest
my
she
whispered
kissing
her
her
her
and
feeling
her
own
irrepressible
and
streaming
tears
tickling
her
nose
and
the
countess
pressed
her
closed
her
and
became
quiet
for
a
suddenly
she
sat
up
with
unaccustomed
glanced
vacantly
around
and
seeing
natasha
began
to
press
her
head
with
all
her
then
she
turned
toward
her
face
which
was
wincing
with
pain
and
gazed
long
at
you
love
she
said
in
a
soft
trustful
you
would
not
deceive
tell
me
the
whole
natasha
looked
at
her
with
eyes
full
of
tears
and
in
her
look
there
was
nothing
but
love
and
an
entreaty
for
darling
she
straining
all
the
power
of
her
love
to
find
some
way
of
taking
on
herself
the
excess
of
grief
that
crushed
her
and
again
in
a
futile
struggle
with
reality
her
refusing
to
believe
that
she
could
live
when
her
beloved
boy
was
killed
in
the
bloom
of
escaped
from
reality
into
a
world
of
natasha
did
not
remember
how
that
day
passed
nor
that
nor
the
next
day
and
she
did
not
sleep
and
did
not
leave
her
her
persevering
and
patient
love
seemed
completely
to
surround
the
countess
every
not
explaining
or
but
recalling
her
to
during
the
third
night
the
countess
kept
very
quiet
for
a
few
and
natasha
rested
her
head
on
the
arm
of
her
chair
and
closed
her
but
opened
them
again
on
hearing
the
bedstead
the
countess
was
sitting
up
in
bed
and
speaking
glad
i
am
you
have
you
are
you
have
some
natasha
went
up
to
have
improved
in
looks
and
grown
more
continued
the
taking
her
what
are
you
he
is
no
no
and
embracing
her
the
countess
began
to
weep
for
the
first
chapter
iii
princess
mary
postponed
her
sonya
and
the
count
tried
to
replace
natasha
but
could
they
saw
that
she
alone
was
able
to
restrain
her
mother
from
unreasoning
for
three
weeks
natasha
remained
constantly
at
her
sleeping
on
a
lounge
chair
in
her
making
her
eat
and
and
talking
to
her
incessantly
because
the
mere
sound
of
her
caressing
tones
soothed
her
the
wounded
spirit
could
not
death
had
torn
from
her
half
her
when
the
news
of
death
had
come
she
had
been
a
fresh
and
vigorous
woman
of
but
a
month
later
she
left
her
room
a
listless
old
woman
taking
no
interest
in
but
the
same
blow
that
almost
killed
the
this
second
restored
natasha
to
a
spiritual
wound
produced
by
a
rending
of
the
spiritual
body
is
like
a
physical
wound
strange
as
it
may
just
as
a
deep
wound
may
heal
and
its
edges
physical
and
spiritual
wounds
alike
can
yet
heal
completely
only
as
the
result
of
a
vital
force
from
wound
healed
in
that
she
thought
her
life
was
but
her
love
for
her
mother
unexpectedly
showed
her
that
the
essence
of
still
active
within
love
awoke
and
so
did
prince
last
days
had
bound
princess
mary
and
natasha
this
new
sorrow
brought
them
still
closer
to
one
princess
mary
put
off
her
and
for
three
weeks
looked
after
natasha
as
if
she
had
been
a
sick
the
last
weeks
passed
in
her
bedroom
had
strained
physical
one
afternoon
noticing
natasha
shivering
with
princess
mary
took
her
to
her
own
room
and
made
her
lie
down
on
the
natasha
lay
but
when
princess
mary
had
drawn
the
blinds
and
was
going
away
she
called
her
want
to
sit
by
me
a
are
to
why
did
you
bring
me
she
will
be
asking
for
is
much
she
spoke
so
well
said
princess
natasha
lay
on
the
bed
and
in
the
semidarkness
of
the
room
scanned
princess
she
like
thought
like
and
yet
not
but
she
is
quite
and
and
she
loves
what
is
in
her
all
that
is
but
what
is
her
mind
what
does
she
think
about
she
is
she
said
drawing
princess
hand
to
you
think
me
mary
how
i
love
let
us
be
quite
and
embracing
began
kissing
her
face
and
making
princess
mary
feel
shy
but
happy
by
this
demonstration
of
her
from
that
day
a
tender
and
passionate
friendship
such
as
exists
only
between
women
was
established
between
princess
mary
and
they
were
continually
kissing
and
saying
tender
things
to
one
another
and
spent
most
of
their
time
when
one
went
out
the
other
became
restless
and
hastened
to
rejoin
together
they
felt
more
in
harmony
with
one
another
than
either
of
them
felt
with
herself
when
a
feeling
stronger
than
friendship
sprang
up
between
an
exclusive
feeling
of
life
being
possible
only
in
each
sometimes
they
were
silent
for
sometimes
after
they
were
already
in
bed
they
would
begin
talking
and
go
on
till
they
spoke
most
of
what
was
long
princess
mary
spoke
of
her
of
her
her
and
her
and
who
with
a
passive
lack
of
understanding
had
formerly
turned
away
from
that
life
of
and
the
poetry
of
christian
now
feeling
herself
bound
to
princess
mary
by
learned
to
love
her
past
too
and
to
understand
a
side
of
life
previously
incomprehensible
to
she
did
not
think
of
applying
submission
and
to
her
own
for
she
was
accustomed
to
seek
other
but
she
understood
and
loved
in
another
those
previously
incomprehensible
for
princess
listening
to
tales
of
childhood
and
early
there
also
opened
out
a
new
and
hitherto
uncomprehended
side
of
belief
in
life
and
its
just
as
they
never
mentioned
him
so
as
not
to
lower
they
their
exalted
feelings
by
but
this
silence
about
him
had
the
effect
of
making
them
gradually
begin
to
forget
him
without
being
conscious
of
natasha
had
grown
thin
and
pale
and
physically
so
weak
that
they
all
talked
about
her
and
this
pleased
but
sometimes
she
was
suddenly
overcome
by
fear
not
only
of
death
but
of
and
loss
of
good
and
involuntarily
she
examined
her
bare
arm
surprised
at
its
and
in
the
morning
noticed
her
drawn
as
it
seemed
to
piteous
face
in
her
it
seemed
to
her
that
things
must
be
and
yet
it
was
dreadfully
one
day
she
went
quickly
upstairs
and
found
herself
out
of
unconsciously
she
immediately
invented
a
reason
for
going
and
testing
her
ran
upstairs
observing
the
another
time
when
she
called
dunyasha
her
voice
so
she
called
she
could
hear
dunyasha
her
in
the
deep
chest
tones
in
which
she
had
been
wont
to
and
listened
attentively
to
she
did
not
know
and
would
not
have
believed
but
beneath
the
layer
of
slime
that
covered
her
soul
and
seemed
to
her
delicate
young
shoots
of
grass
were
already
which
taking
root
would
so
cover
with
their
living
verdure
the
grief
that
weighed
her
down
that
it
would
soon
no
longer
be
seen
or
the
wound
had
begun
to
heal
from
at
the
end
of
january
princess
mary
left
for
and
the
count
insisted
on
going
with
her
to
consult
the
chapter
iv
after
the
encounter
at
where
kutuzov
had
been
unable
to
hold
back
his
troops
in
their
anxiety
to
overwhelm
and
cut
off
the
enemy
and
so
the
farther
movement
of
the
fleeing
and
of
the
russians
who
pursued
continued
as
far
as
krasnoe
without
a
the
flight
was
so
rapid
that
the
russian
army
pursuing
the
french
could
not
keep
up
with
cavalry
and
artillery
horses
broke
and
the
information
received
of
the
movements
of
the
french
was
never
the
men
in
the
russian
army
were
so
worn
out
by
this
continuous
marching
at
the
rate
of
miles
a
day
that
they
could
not
go
any
to
realize
the
degree
of
exhaustion
of
the
russian
army
it
is
only
necessary
to
grasp
clearly
the
meaning
of
the
fact
while
not
losing
more
than
five
thousand
killed
and
wounded
after
tarutino
and
less
than
a
hundred
the
russian
army
which
left
that
place
a
hundred
thousand
strong
reached
krasnoe
with
only
fifty
the
rapidity
of
the
russian
pursuit
was
just
as
destructive
to
our
army
as
the
flight
of
the
french
was
to
the
only
difference
was
that
the
russian
army
moved
with
no
such
threat
of
destruction
as
hung
over
the
and
that
the
sick
frenchmen
were
left
behind
in
enemy
hands
while
the
sick
russians
left
behind
were
among
their
own
the
chief
cause
of
the
wastage
of
army
was
the
rapidity
of
its
and
a
convincing
proof
of
this
is
the
corresponding
decrease
of
the
russian
kutuzov
as
far
as
was
in
his
instead
of
trying
to
check
the
movement
of
the
french
as
was
desired
in
petersburg
and
by
the
russian
army
directed
his
whole
activity
as
he
had
done
at
tarutino
and
to
hastening
it
on
while
easing
the
movement
of
our
but
besides
since
the
exhaustion
and
enormous
diminution
of
the
army
caused
by
the
rapidity
of
the
advance
had
become
another
reason
for
slackening
the
pace
and
delaying
presented
itself
to
the
aim
of
the
russian
army
was
to
pursue
the
the
road
the
french
would
take
was
and
so
the
closer
our
troops
trod
on
their
heels
the
greater
distance
they
had
to
only
by
following
at
some
distance
could
one
cut
across
the
zigzag
path
of
the
all
the
artful
maneuvers
suggested
by
our
generals
meant
fresh
movements
of
the
army
and
a
lengthening
of
its
whereas
the
only
reasonable
aim
was
to
shorten
those
to
that
end
activity
was
directed
during
the
whole
campaign
from
moscow
to
casually
or
intermittently
but
so
consistently
that
he
never
once
deviated
from
kutuzov
felt
and
by
reasoning
or
science
but
with
the
whole
of
his
russian
every
russian
soldier
that
the
french
were
that
the
enemy
was
flying
and
must
be
driven
but
at
the
same
time
he
like
the
soldiers
realized
all
the
hardship
of
this
the
rapidity
of
which
was
unparalleled
for
such
a
time
of
the
but
to
the
especially
the
foreign
ones
in
the
russian
who
wished
to
distinguish
to
astonish
and
for
some
reason
to
capture
a
king
or
a
seemed
that
any
battle
must
be
horrible
and
the
very
time
to
fight
and
conquer
kutuzov
merely
shrugged
his
shoulders
when
one
after
another
they
presented
projects
of
maneuvers
to
be
made
with
those
insufficiently
and
half
within
a
month
and
without
fighting
a
battle
had
dwindled
to
half
their
and
who
at
the
best
if
the
flight
continued
would
have
to
go
a
greater
distance
than
they
had
already
before
they
reached
the
this
longing
to
distinguish
to
to
and
to
cut
off
showed
itself
particularly
whenever
the
russians
stumbled
on
the
french
so
it
was
at
where
they
expected
to
find
one
of
the
three
french
columns
and
stumbled
instead
on
napoleon
himself
with
sixteen
thousand
despite
all
efforts
to
avoid
that
ruinous
encounter
and
to
preserve
his
the
massacre
of
the
broken
mob
of
french
soldiers
by
russians
continued
at
krasnoe
for
three
toll
wrote
a
first
column
will
march
to
so
and
and
as
usual
nothing
happened
in
accord
with
the
prince
eugene
of
wurttemberg
fired
from
a
hill
over
the
french
crowds
that
were
running
and
demanded
reinforcements
which
did
not
the
avoiding
the
dispersed
and
hid
themselves
in
the
forest
by
making
their
way
round
as
best
they
and
continued
their
who
said
he
did
not
want
to
know
anything
about
the
commissariat
affairs
of
his
and
could
never
be
found
when
he
was
chevalier
sans
peur
et
sans
reproche
as
he
styled
was
fond
of
parleys
with
the
sent
envoys
demanding
their
wasted
and
did
not
do
what
he
was
ordered
to
knight
without
fear
and
without
give
you
that
he
riding
up
to
the
troops
and
pointing
out
the

the

spurs
and

urging
on
horses
that
could
scarcely
trotted
with
much
effort
to
the
column
presented
to
is
to
to
a
crowd
of
frenchmen
stark
with
and
the
column
that
had
been
presented
to
them
threw
down
its
arms
and
surrendered
as
it
had
long
been
anxious
to
at
krasnoe
they
took
thousand
several
hundred
and
a
stick
called
a
and
disputed

to
who
had
distinguished
himself
and
were
pleased
with
their
though
they
much
regretted
not
having
taken
or
at
least
a
marshal
or
a
hero
of
some
and
reproached
one
another
and
especially
kutuzov
for
having
failed
to
do
these
carried
away
by
their
were
but
blind
tools
of
the
most
melancholy
law
of
but
considered
themselves
heroes
and
imagined
that
they
were
accomplishing
a
most
noble
and
honorable
they
blamed
kutuzov
and
said
that
from
the
very
beginning
of
the
campaign
he
had
prevented
their
vanquishing
that
he
thought
of
nothing
but
satisfying
his
passions
and
would
not
advance
from
the
linen
factories
because
he
was
comfortable
that
at
krasnoe
he
checked
the
advance
because
on
learning
that
napoleon
was
there
he
had
quite
lost
his
and
that
it
was
probable
that
he
had
an
understanding
with
napoleon
and
had
been
bribed
by
and
so
and
so
not
only
did
his
carried
away
by
their
talk
in
this
but
posterity
and
history
have
acclaimed
napoleon
as
while
kutuzov
is
described
by
foreigners
as
a
weak
old
and
by
russians
as
something
sort
of
puppet
useful
only
because
he
had
a
russian
chapter
v
in
1812
and
1813
kutuzov
was
openly
accused
of
the
emperor
was
dissatisfied
with
and
in
a
history
recently
written
by
order
of
the
highest
authorities
it
is
said
that
kutuzov
was
a
cunning
court
frightened
of
the
name
of
and
that
by
his
blunders
at
krasnoe
and
the
berezina
he
deprived
the
russian
army
of
the
glory
of
complete
victory
over
the
history
of
the
year
the
character
of
kutuzov
and
reflections
on
the
unsatisfactory
results
of
the
battles
at
by
such
is
the
fate
not
of
great
men
whom
the
russian
mind
does
not
but
of
those
rare
and
always
solitary
individuals
discerning
the
will
of
submit
their
personal
will
to
the
hatred
and
contempt
of
the
crowd
punish
such
men
for
discerning
the
higher
for
russian
strange
and
terrible
to
most
insignificant
tool
of
history
who
never
even
in
showed
human
is
the
object
of
adulation
and
he
is
but
man
who
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
his
activity
in
never
once
swerving
by
word
or
deed
from
borodino
to
presented
an
example
exceptional
in
history
of
and
a
present
consciousness
of
the
future
importance
of
what
was
kutuzov
seems
to
them
something
indefinite
and
and
when
speaking
of
him
and
of
the
year
1812
they
always
seem
a
little
and
yet
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
an
historical
character
whose
activity
was
so
unswervingly
directed
to
a
single
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
any
aim
more
worthy
or
more
consonant
with
the
will
of
the
whole
still
more
difficult
would
it
be
to
find
an
instance
in
history
of
the
aim
of
an
historical
personage
being
so
completely
accomplished
as
that
to
which
all
efforts
were
directed
in
kutuzov
never
talked
of
centuries
looking
down
from
the
of
the
sacrifices
he
offered
for
the
or
of
what
he
intended
to
accomplish
or
had
in
general
he
said
nothing
about
adopted
no
always
appeared
to
be
the
simplest
and
most
ordinary
of
and
said
the
simplest
and
most
ordinary
he
wrote
letters
to
his
daughters
and
to
madame
de
read
liked
the
society
of
pretty
jested
with
and
and
never
contradicted
those
who
tried
to
prove
anything
to
when
count
rostopchin
at
the
yauza
bridge
galloped
up
to
kutuzov
with
personal
reproaches
for
having
caused
the
destruction
of
and
was
it
you
promised
not
to
abandon
moscow
without
a
kutuzov
i
shall
not
abandon
moscow
without
a
though
moscow
was
then
already
when
coming
to
him
from
the
said
that
ermolov
ought
to
be
appointed
chief
of
the
kutuzov
i
was
just
saying
so
though
a
moment
before
he
had
said
quite
the
what
did
it
matter
to
then
alone
amid
a
senseless
crowd
understood
the
whole
tremendous
significance
of
what
was
did
it
matter
to
him
whether
rostopchin
attributed
the
calamities
of
moscow
to
him
or
to
still
less
could
it
matter
to
him
who
was
appointed
chief
of
the
not
merely
in
these
cases
but
continually
did
that
old
by
experience
of
life
had
reached
the
conviction
that
thoughts
and
the
words
serving
as
their
expression
are
not
what
move
quite
meaningless
words
that
happened
to
enter
his
but
that
so
heedless
of
his
did
not
once
during
the
whole
time
of
his
activity
utter
one
word
inconsistent
with
the
single
aim
toward
which
he
moved
throughout
the
whole
obviously
in
spite
of
in
very
diverse
he
repeatedly
expressed
his
real
thoughts
with
the
bitter
conviction
that
he
would
not
be
beginning
with
the
battle
of
from
which
time
his
disagreement
with
those
about
him
he
alone
said
that
the
battle
of
borodino
was
a
and
repeated
this
both
verbally
and
in
his
dispatches
and
reports
up
to
the
time
of
his
he
alone
said
that
the
loss
of
moscow
is
not
the
loss
of
in
reply
to
proposal
of
he
there
can
be
no
for
such
is
the
he
alone
during
the
retreat
of
the
french
said
that
all
our
maneuvers
are
everything
is
being
accomplished
of
itself
better
than
we
could
that
the
enemy
must
be
offered
golden
that
neither
the
the
nor
the
krasnoe
battles
were
that
we
must
keep
some
force
to
reach
the
frontier
and
that
he
would
not
sacrifice
a
single
russian
for
ten
and
this
as
he
is
described
to
who
lies
to
arakcheev
to
please
the
he
thereby
the
in
vilna
that
to
carry
the
war
beyond
the
frontier
is
useless
and
nor
do
words
alone
prove
that
only
he
understood
the
meaning
of
the
his
the
smallest
all
directed
to
one
and
the
same
threefold
to
brace
all
his
strength
for
conflict
with
the
to
defeat
and
to
drive
them
out
of
minimizing
as
far
as
possible
the
sufferings
of
our
people
and
of
our
this
procrastinator
whose
motto
was
and
this
enemy
of
decisive
gave
battle
at
investing
the
preparations
for
it
with
unparalleled
this
kutuzov
who
before
the
battle
of
austerlitz
began
said
that
it
would
be
he
in
contradiction
to
everyone
declared
till
his
death
that
borodino
was
a
despite
the
assurance
of
generals
that
the
battle
was
lost
and
despite
the
fact
that
for
an
army
to
have
to
retire
after
winning
a
battle
was
he
alone
during
the
whole
retreat
insisted
that
which
were
useless
should
not
be
and
that
a
new
war
should
not
be
begun
nor
the
frontiers
of
russia
it
is
easy
now
to
understand
the
significance
of
these
only
we
abstain
from
attributing
to
the
activity
of
the
mass
aims
that
existed
only
in
the
heads
of
a
dozen
the
events
and
results
now
lie
before
but
how
did
that
old
in
opposition
to
the
general
so
truly
discern
the
importance
of
the
view
of
the
events
that
in
all
his
activity
he
was
never
once
untrue
to
the
source
of
that
extraordinary
power
of
penetrating
the
meaning
of
the
events
then
occuring
lay
in
the
national
feeling
which
he
possessed
in
full
purity
and
only
the
recognition
of
the
fact
that
he
possessed
this
feeling
caused
the
people
in
so
strange
a
contrary
to
the
to
select
old
man
in
be
their
representative
in
the
national
and
only
that
feeling
placed
him
on
that
highest
human
pedestal
from
which
the
devoted
all
his
powers
not
to
slaying
and
destroying
men
but
to
saving
and
showing
pity
on
that
and
therefore
truly
figure
could
not
be
cast
in
the
false
mold
of
a
european
supposed
ruler
of
history
has
to
a
lackey
no
man
can
be
for
a
lackey
has
his
own
conception
of
chapter
vi
the
fifth
of
november
was
the
first
day
of
what
is
called
the
battle
of
toward
much
disputing
and
many
mistakes
made
by
generals
who
did
not
go
to
their
proper
and
after
adjutants
had
been
sent
about
with
it
had
become
plain
that
the
enemy
was
everywhere
in
flight
and
that
there
could
and
would
be
no
kutuzov
left
krasnoe
and
went
to
dobroe
whither
his
headquarters
had
that
day
been
the
day
was
clear
and
kutuzov
rode
to
dobroe
on
his
plump
little
white
followed
by
an
enormous
suite
of
discontented
generals
who
whispered
among
themselves
behind
his
all
along
the
road
groups
of
french
prisoners
captured
that
day
were
seven
thousand
of
were
crowding
to
warm
themselves
at
near
dobroe
an
immense
crowd
of
tattered
buzzing
with
talk
and
wrapped
and
bandaged
in
anything
they
had
been
able
to
get
hold
were
standing
in
the
road
beside
a
long
row
of
unharnessed
french
at
the
approach
of
the
the
buzz
of
talk
ceased
and
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
kutuzov
wearing
a
white
cap
with
a
red
band
and
a
padded
overcoat
that
bulged
on
his
round
moved
slowly
along
the
road
on
his
white
one
of
the
generals
was
reporting
to
him
where
the
guns
and
prisoners
had
been
kutuzov
seemed
preoccupied
and
did
not
listen
to
what
the
general
was
he
screwed
up
his
eyes
with
a
dissatisfied
look
as
he
gazed
attentively
and
fixedly
at
these
who
presented
a
specially
wretched
most
of
them
were
disfigured
by
noses
and
and
nearly
all
had
swollen
and
festering
one
group
of
the
french
stood
close
to
the
and
two
of
one
of
whom
had
his
face
covered
with

tearing
a
piece
of
raw
flesh
with
their
there
was
something
horrible
and
bestial
in
the
fleeting
glance
they
threw
at
the
riders
and
in
the
malevolent
expression
with
after
a
glance
at
the
soldier
with
the
sores
immediately
turned
away
and
went
on
with
what
he
was
kutuzov
looked
long
and
intently
at
these
two
he
puckered
his
screwed
up
his
and
pensively
swayed
his
at
another
spot
he
noticed
a
russian
soldier
laughingly
patting
a
frenchman
on
the
saying
something
to
him
in
a
friendly
and
kutuzov
with
the
same
expression
on
his
face
again
swayed
his
were
you
he
asked
the
who
continuing
his
report
directed
the
attention
to
some
standards
captured
from
the
french
and
standing
in
front
of
the
preobrazhensk
the
said
evidently
detaching
himself
with
difficulty
from
the
thoughts
that
preoccupied
he
looked
about
him
thousands
of
eyes
were
looking
at
him
from
all
sides
awaiting
a
word
from
he
stopped
in
front
of
the
preobrazhensk
sighed
and
closed
his
one
of
his
suite
beckoned
to
the
soldiers
carrying
the
standards
to
advance
and
surround
the
with
kutuzov
was
silent
for
a
few
seconds
and
submitting
with
evident
reluctance
to
the
duty
imposed
by
his
raised
his
head
and
began
to
a
throng
of
officers
surrounded
he
looked
attentively
around
at
the
circle
of
recognizing
several
of
thank
you
he
addressing
the
soldiers
and
then
again
the
in
the
stillness
around
him
his
slowly
uttered
words
were
distinctly
thank
you
all
for
your
hard
and
faithful
the
victory
is
complete
and
russia
will
not
forget
honor
to
you
he
paused
and
looked
its
lower

said
to
a
soldier
who
had
accidentally
lowered
the
french
eagle

was
holding
before
the
preobrazhensk

a
rapid
movement

thousands

the
soldiers
were
shouting

leaned
forward
in
his
saddle
and
bowed
his
and
his
eye
lit
up
with
a
mild
and
apparently
ironic
said
he
when
the
shouts
had
and
all
at
once
his
voice
and
the
expression
of
his
face
it
was
no
longer
the
speaking
but
an
ordinary
old
man
who
wanted
to
tell
his
comrades
something
very
there
was
a
stir
among
the
throng
of
officers
and
in
the
ranks
of
the
who
moved
that
they
might
hear
better
what
he
was
going
to
i
know
hard
for
but
it
be
bear
it
be
for
long
see
our
visitors
off
and
then
the
tsar
forget
your
it
is
hard
for
but
still
you
are
at
home
while
see
what
they
have
come

to
the
off
than
our
poorest
while
they
were
strong
we
spare
but
now
we
may
even
pity
they
are
human
beings
it
he
looked
and
in
the
wondering
gaze
fixed
upon
him
he
read
sympathy
with
what
he
had
his
face
grew
brighter
and
brighter
with
an
old
mild
which
drew
the
corners
of
his
lips
and
eyes
into
a
cluster
of
he
ceased
speaking
and
bowed
his
head
as
if
in
after
all
who
asked
them
serves
them
the
bloody
he
suddenly
lifting
his
and
flourishing
his
whip
he
rode
off
at
a
gallop
for
the
first
time
during
the
whole
and
left
the
broken
ranks
of
the
soldiers
laughing
joyfully
and
shouting
words
were
hardly
understood
by
the
no
one
could
have
repeated
the
field
begun
solemnly
and
then
changing
into
an
old
simplehearted
but
the
hearty
sincerity
of
that
the
feeling
of
majestic
triumph
combined
with
pity
for
the
foe
and
consciousness
of
the
justice
of
our
exactly
expressed
by
that
old
was
not
merely
understood
but
lay
in
the
soul
of
every
soldier
and
found
expression
in
their
joyous
and
sustained
afterwards
when
one
of
the
generals
addressed
kutuzov
asking
whether
he
wished
his
caleche
to

was
already
growing

it
had
been
calm
and
frosty

toward

it
began

itself

numbered
only

one
of
the
first
to
arrive
that
night
at
its
halting
village
on
the
the
quartermasters
who
met
the
regiment
announced
that
all
the
huts
were
full
of
sick
and
dead
and
members
of
the

was
only
one
hut
available
for
the
regimental

commander
rode
up
to
his

regiment

through
the
village
and
stacked
its
arms
in
front
of
the
last
like
some
huge
the
regiment
began
to
prepare
its
lair
and
its
one
part
of
it
dispersed
and
waded
through
the
snow
into
a
birch
forest
to
the
right
of
the
and
immediately
the
sound
of
axes
and
the
crashing
of
and
merry
voices
could
be
heard
from
another
section
amid
the
regimental
wagons
and
horses
which
were
standing
in
a
group

busy
getting
out
caldrons
and
rye
and
feeding

third
section
scattered
through
the
village
arranging
quarters
for
the
staff

out

french
corpses
that
were
in

and
dragging
away
dry
and
thatch
from

wattle
fences
to
serve
for
some
fifteen
men
with
merry
shouts
were
shaking
down
the
high
wattle
wall
of
a

had
already
been

the
huge
surface
of

with
snow

seen
swaying
in
the
gloom
of
the
the
lower
stakes
cracked
more
and
more
and
at
last
the
wall
and
with
it
the

and
joyous

up

and
a
pleasant
velvety
voice
began
to
at
the
end
of
the
third
verse
as
the
last
note
died
twenty
voices
roared
out
at
all
heave
but
despite
their
united
efforts
the
wattle
hardly
and
in
the
silence
that
followed
the
heavy
breathing
of
the
men

was
about
five
feet
long

seven

forward
along
the
village

cutting
the
shoulders
of
the
gasping
what

you
stopping
there
merry
senseless
words
of
abuse
flowed
are
you
up
suddenly
came
the
authoritative
voice
of
a
sergeant

came
upon

general

in

frightened
whisper

a
laughing
and
moderating
their
tones
the
men
moved
when
they
were
out
of
the
village
they
began
talking
again
as
loud
as
interlarding
their
talk
with
the
same
aimless
in
the
hut
which
the
men
had
the
chief
officers
had
gathered
and
were
in
animated

place
the
campfires
were
blazing
on
all
sides
ready
for
the
wood
the
snow
was

black
shadows
of
soldiers
flitted

would
have
thought
that
under
the
almost
incredibly
wretched
conditions

russian
soldiers
were
in
at
that

and
sheepskin
without
a
roof

very
sad
and
depressing
on
the
the
army
had
never
under
the
best
material
conditions
presented
a
more
cheerful
and
animated
this
was
because
all
who
began
to
grow
depressed
or
who
lost
strength
were
sifted
out
of
the
army
day
by
all
the
physically
or
morally
weak

long
since

left
behind

and
more

collected
behind
the
wattle
fence
of
the
eighth
company
than
anywhere
two
sergeants
major
were
sitting
with
them
and
their
campfire
blazed
brighter
than
for
leave
to
sit
by
their
wattle

demanded

he
to
another
this
man
was
neither
a
sergeant
nor
a

being
robust
he
ordered
about
those
weaker
than
the
soldier
they
called
a
thin
little
fellow
with
a
sharp
rose
obediently
and
was
about
to
go
but
at
that
instant
there
came
into
the
light
of
the
fire
the
handsome
figure
of
a
young
soldier
carrying
a
load
of
it
they
split
up

down
on

the
men
drew
nearer
and
lit
their
the
handsome
young
soldier
who
had
brought
the
setting
his
arms
began
stamping
his
cold
feet
rapidly
and
deftly
on
the
spot
where

threw
it
on

that
when
finished
hammering
to
receive
double
that
son
of
a
bitch
petrov
has
lagged
behind
after
it
said
one
sergeant
had
an
eye
on
him
this
long
said
the
a
poor
sort
of
in
the
third
company
they
say
nine
men
were
missing
all
very
but
when
a
feet
are
frozen
how
can
he
talk
said
a
sergeant
you
want
to
be
doing
the
said
an
old
turning
reproachfully
to
the
man
who
had
spoken
of
frozen
you
said
the
man
they
called
jackdaw

a
squeaky
and
unsteady
raising
himself
at
the
other
side
of

with
sudden
resolution
turning
to
the
sergeant

to
send
me
to
aching
all
anyway
i
be
able
to
keep
replied
the
sergeant
major
the
soldier
said
no
more
and
the
talk
went
a
lot
of
those
frenchies
were
taken
and
the
fact
is
that
not
one
of
them
had
what
you
might
call
real
boots
said
a
starting
a
new
were
no
more
than
cossacks
have
taken
their
they
were
clearing
the
hut
for
the
colonel
and
carried
them
it
was
pitiful
to
see
put
in
the
they
turned
them
over
one
seemed
still
alive
would
you
believe
he
jabbered
something
in
their
a
clean
the
first
man
went
was
as
white
as
some
of
them
are
such
fine
you
might
think
they
were
what
do
you
they
make
soldiers
of
all
classes
they
understand
our
talk
at
said
the
dancer
with
a
puzzled
asked
him
whose
subject
he
and
he
jabbered
in
his
own
a
queer
continued
the
man
who
had
wondered
at
their
peasants
at
mozhaysk
were
saying
that
when
they
began
burying
the
the
battle
was
you
those
dead
had
been
lying
there
for
nearly
a
and
says
the
lie
as
white
as
and
not
as
much

as
a
puff
of
powder
it
from
the
asked
a
clever
from
the
cold
it
was
if
it
had
been
from
the
ours
would
not
have
rotted
he
up
to
ours
and
they
are
all
rotten
and
he
tie
our
faces
up
with
kerchiefs
and
turn
our
heads
away
as
we
drag
them
we
can
hardly
do
but
he
white
as
paper
and
not
so
much
smell
as
a
whiff
of
all
were
must
be
from
their
said
the
sergeant
used
to
gobble
the
same
food
as
the
no
one
contradicted
peasant
near
mozhaysk
where
the
battle
was
said
the
men
were
all
called
up
from
ten
villages
around
and
they
carted
for
twenty
days
and
still
finish
carting
the
dead
and
as
for
the
he
was
a
real
said
an
old
the
only
one
worth
but
since

you
the
day
before
yesterday
we
ran
at
them

let
us
get
near
before

just
threw
down
their
muskets
and
went
on
their
they
only
one

himself
but
he

the
right

catches
him

a
bird
in
his
hands

no

killing
him
a
when

into
my
when

in
the
ground

an
aspen
stake
to
fix
him
what
a
lot
of
men

going
to
end

come
here
remarked
the
old
the
conversation
and
the
soldiers
began
settling
down
to
at
the
wonderful
how
they
you
would
think
the
women
had
spread
out
their
said
one
of
the
gazing
with
admiration
at

fire
only
for
look
how
in
the
silence
that
the
snoring
of
those
who
had
fallen
asleep
could
be
others
turned
over
and
warmed
now
and
again
exchanging
a
few
from
a
campfire
a
hundred
paces
off
came
a
sound
of
merry
at
them
roaring
there
in
the
fifth
said
one
of
the
what
a
lot
of
them
there
one
of
the
men
got
up
and
went
over
to
the
fifth
having
such
said
coming
frenchies
have
turned
quite
frozen
and
the
an
awful
singing
go
across
and
have
a
and
several
of
the
men
went
over
to
the
fifth
chapter
ix
the
fifth
company
was
bivouacking
at
the
very
edge
of
the
a
huge
campfire
was
blazing
brightly
in
the
midst
of
the
lighting
up
the
branches
of
trees
heavy
with
about
midnight
they
heard
the
sound
of
steps
in
the
snow
of
the
and
the
crackling
of
dry
said
one
of
the
they
all
raised
their
heads
to
and
out
of
the
forest
into
the
bright
firelight
stepped
two
strangely
clad
human
figures
clinging
to
one
these
were
two
frenchmen
who
had
been
hiding
in
the
they
came
up
to
the
hoarsely
uttering
something
in
a
language
our
soldiers
did
not
one
was
taller
than
the
he
wore
an
hat
and
seemed
quite
on
approaching
the
fire
he
had
been
going
to
sit
but
the
a
short
sturdy
soldier
with
a
shawl
tied
round
his
was
he
raised
his
companion
and
said
pointing
to
his
the
soldiers
surrounded
the
spread
a
greatcoat
on
the
ground
for
the
sick
and
brought
some
buckwheat
porridge
and
vodka
for
both
of
the
exhausted
french
officer
was
ramballe
and
the
man
with
his
head
wrapped
in
the
shawl
was
his
when
morel
had
drunk
some
vodka
and
finished
his
bowl
of
porridge
he
suddenly
became
unnaturally
merry
and
chattered
incessantly
to
the
who
could
not
understand
ramballe
refused
food
and
resting
his
head
on
his
elbow
lay
silent
beside
the
looking
at
the
russian
soldiers
with
red
and
vacant
occasionally
he
emitted
a
groan
and
then
again
became
pointing
to
his
tried
to
impress
on
the
soldiers
the
fact
that
ramballe
was
an
officer
and
ought
to
be
a
russian
officer
who
had
come
up
to
the
fire
sent
to
ask
his
colonel
whether
he
would
not
take
a
french
officer
into
his
hut
to
warm
and
when
the
messenger
returned
and
said
that
the
colonel
wished
the
officer
to
be
brought
to
ramballe
was
told
to
he
rose
and
tried
to
but
staggered
and
would
have
fallen
had
not
a
soldier
standing
by
held
him
do
it
said
one
of
the
winking
and
turning
mockingly
to
you
why
talk
lout
that
you
real
came
rebukes
from
all
sides
addressed
to
the
jesting
they
surrounded
lifted
him
on
the
crossed
arms
of
two
and
carried
him
to
the
ramballe
put
his
arms
around
their
necks
while
they
carried
him
and
began
wailing
you
fine
my
kind
these
are
my
kind
and
he
leaned
his
head
against
the
shoulder
of
one
of
the
men
like
a
meanwhile
morel
was
sitting
in
the
best
place
by
the
surrounded
by
the
a
short
sturdy
frenchman

inflamed
and
streaming

wearing
a
cloak
and
had
a
shawl
tied
woman
fashion
round
his
head
over
his

was
evidently
and
was
singing
a
french
song
in
a
hoarse
broken
with
an
arm
thrown
round
the
nearest
the
soldiers
simply
held
their
sides
as
they
watched
now
teach
us
how
it
soon
pick
it
how
is
said
the
singer

chapter
x
the
french
army
melted
away
at
the
uniform
rate
of
a
mathematical
and
that
crossing
of
the
berezina
about
which
so
much
has
been
written
was
only
one
intermediate
stage
in
its
and
not
at
all
the
decisive
episode
of
the
if
so
much
has
been
and
still
is
written
about
the
on
the
french
side
this
is
only
because
at
the
broken
bridge
across
that
river
the
calamities
their
army
had
been
previously
enduring
were
suddenly
concentrated
at
one
moment
into
a
tragic
spectacle
that
remained
in
every
and
on
the
russian
side
merely
because
in
from
the
seat
of
plan
one
of
had
been
devised
to
catch
napoleon
in
a
strategic
trap
at
the
berezina
everyone
assured
himself
that
all
would
happen
according
to
and
therefore
insisted
that
it
was
just
the
crossing
of
the
berezina
that
destroyed
the
french
in
reality
the
results
of
the
crossing
were
much
less
disastrous
to
the
guns
and
men
krasnoe
had
as
the
figures
the
sole
importance
of
the
crossing
of
the
berezina
lies
in
the
fact
that
it
plainly
and
indubitably
proved
the
fallacy
of
all
the
plans
for
cutting
off
the
retreat
and
the
soundness
of
the
only
possible
line
of
one
kutuzov
and
the
general
mass
of
the
army
simply
to
follow
the
enemy
the
french
crowd
fled
at
a
continually
increasing
speed
and
all
its
energy
was
directed
to
reaching
its
it
fled
like
a
wounded
animal
and
it
was
impossible
to
block
its
this
was
shown
not
so
much
by
the
arrangements
it
made
for
crossing
as
by
what
took
place
at
the
when
the
bridges
broke
unarmed
people
from
moscow
and
women
with
children
who
were
with
the
french
on
by
vis
pressed
forward
into
boats
and
into
the
water
and
did
that
impulse
was
the
condition
of
fugitives
and
of
pursuers
was
equally
as
long
as
they
remained
with
their
own
people
each
might
hope
for
help
from
his
fellows
and
the
definite
place
he
held
among
but
those
who
while
remaining
in
the
same
pitiful
would
be
on
a
lower
level
to
claim
a
share
in
the
necessities
of
the
french
did
not
need
to
be
informed
of
the
fact
that
half
the
whom
the
russians
did
not
know
what
to
of
cold
and
hunger
despite
their
desire
to
save
they
felt
that
it
could
not

most
compassionate

favorable
to
the

nothing
for

perished
from
the
conditions
to
which
the
russian

was
itself
it
was
impossible
to
take
bread
and
clothes
from
our
hungry
and
indispensable
soldiers
to
give
to
the
french
though
not

were
simply
some

even
did
but
they
were
certain
destruction

behind
the
french

in

there
was

been
there
was
no
salvation
save
in
collective
and
on
that
the
whole
strength
of
the
french
was
the
farther
they
fled
the
more
wretched
became
the
plight
of
the
especially
after
the
on
which
consequence
of
the
petersburg
special
hopes
had
been
placed
by
the
and
the
keener
grew
the
passions
of
the
russian
who
blamed

another

of
anticipation
that
the
failure
of
the
petersburg
berezina
plan
would
be
attributed
to

led
to
and
more
and
more
strongly
the
ridicule
and
contempt
were
of
course
expressed
in
a
respectful
making
it
impossible
for
him
to
ask
wherein
he
was
to
they
did
not
talk
seriously
to
when
reporting
to
him
or
asking
for
his
sanction
they
appeared
to
be
fulfilling
a
regrettable
but
they
winked
behind
his
back
and
tried
to
mislead
him
at
every
because
they
could
not
understand
him
all
these
people
assumed
that
it
was
useless
to
talk
to
the
old
that
he
would
never
grasp
the
profundity
of
their
that
he
would
answer
with
his
phrases
they
thought
were
mere
about
a
about
the
impossibility
of
crossing
the
frontier
with
a
crowd
of
and
so
they
had
heard
all
that

all

it
was
necessary
to
await

that
the

had
no
so
while
what
they
proposed

so
complicated

old

stupid

that
the
power

was
supposed
to
hold

no
longer
and
he
understood
this
not
merely
from
the
attitude
of
the
he
saw
on
the
one
hand
that
the
military
business
in
which
he
had
played
his
part
was
ended
and
felt
that
his
mission
was
and
at
the

time

began
to
be
conscious
of
the
physical
weariness
of
his
aged
body

of
the
necessity

of

been
governor
of

that
wealthy
which
had
not
been

found
old
friends
and
besides
the
comforts
of
life
of
which
he
had
so
long
been
and
he
suddenly
turned
from
the
cares
of
army
and
state
as
far
as
the
passions
that
seethed
around
him
immersed
himself
in
the
quiet
life
to
which
he
had
formerly
been
as
if
all
that
was
taking
place
and
all
that
had
still
to
be
done
in
the
realm
of
history
did
not
concern
him
at
one
of
the
most
zealous
and
who
had
first
wanted
to
effect
a
diversion
in
greece
and
then
in
warsaw
but
never
wished
to
go
where
he
was
noted
for
the
boldness
with
which
he
spoke
to
the
and
who
considered
kutuzov
to
be
under
an
obligation
to
him
because
when
he
was
sent
to
make
peace
with
turkey
in
1811
independently
of

found
that
peace
had
already
been

admitted
to
the
emperor
that
the
merit
of
securing
that
peace
was

was
the
first
to
meet
kutuzov
at
the
castle

the
latter
was
to

undress

with
a

holding
his
cap
under

handed
kutuzov
a
garrison

and
the
keys
of
the
the
contemptuously
respectful
attitude
of
the
younger
men
to
the
old
man
in
his
dotage
was
expressed
in
the
highest
degree
by
the
behavior
of
who
knew
of
the
accusations
that
were
being
directed
against
when
speaking
to
kutuzov
incidentally
mentioned
that
the
vehicles
packed
with
china
that
had
been
captured
from
him
at
borisov
had
been
recovered
and
would
be
restored
to
mean
to
imply
that
i
have
nothing
to
eat
out
on
the
i
can
supply
you
with
everything
even
if
you
want
to
give
dinner
warmly
replied
who
tried
by
every
word
he
spoke
to
prove
his
own
rectitude
and
therefore
imagined
kutuzov
to
be
animated
by
the
same

with
his
subtle

merely
to
say
what
i
contrary
to
the
wish
kutuzov
detained
the
greater
part
of
the
army
at
those
about
him
said
that
he
became
extraordinarily
slack
and
physically
feeble
during
his
stay
in
that
he
attended
to
army
affairs
left
everything
to
his
and
while
awaiting
the
arrival
led
a
dissipated
having
left

on
the
seventh
of
december
with
his
prince
and
emperor
reached
vilna
on

in
his
traveling
sleigh
drove

to

of
the
severe

who
galloped
to
the
castle
in
in
a
troyka
with
three
shouted
and
konovnitsyn
rushed
into
the
vestibule
to
inform
who
was
waiting
in
the
hall
little
a
minute
later
the
old
large
stout
figure
in
his
chest
covered
with
orders
and
a
scarf
drawn
round
his
waddled
out
into
the
he
put
on
his
hat
with
its
peaks
to
the
sides
holding
his
gloves
in
his
hand
and
walking
with
an
effort
sideways
down
the
steps
to

of

in
his
hand
the
report
he
had
prepared
for
the
there
was
running
to
and
fro
and
another
troyka
flew
furiously
and
then
all
eyes
were
turned
on
an
approaching
sleigh
in
which
the
figures
of
the
emperor
and
volkonski
could
already
be
from
the
habit
of
fifty
years
all
this
had
a
physically
agitating
effect
on
the
old
he
carefully
and
hastily
felt
himself
all
readjusted
his
and
pulling
himself
together
drew
himself
up
at
the
very
moment
when
the
having
alighted
from
the
lifted
his
eyes
to
handed
him
the
report
and
began
speaking
in
his
ingratiating
the
emperor

a
rapid
glance
scanned
kutuzov
from
head
to
frowned
for
an

immediately
mastering
himself
went
up
to
the
old
extended
his
arms
and
embraced
and
this
embrace
owing
to
a
impression
related
to
his
innermost
had
its
usual
effect
on
kutuzov
and
he
gave
a
the
emperor
greeted
the
officers
and
the
semenov
and
again
pressing
the
old
hand
went
with
him
into
the
when
alone
with
the
field
marshal
the
emperor
expressed
his
dissatisfaction
at
the
slowness
of
the
pursuit
and
at
the
mistakes
made
at
krasnoe
and
the
and
informed
him
of
his
intentions
for
a
future
campaign
kutuzov
made
no
rejoinder
or
the
same
expressionless
look
with
which
he
had
listened
to
the
commands
on
the
field
of
austerlitz
seven
years
before
settled
on
his
face
when
kutuzov
came
out
of
the
study
and
with
lowered
head
was
crossing
the
ballroom
with
his
heavy
waddling
he
was
arrested
by
voice
serene
kutuzov
raised
his
head
and
looked
for
a
long
while
into
the
eyes
of
count
who
stood
before
him
holding
a
silver
salver
on
which
lay
a
small
kutuzov
seemed
not
to
understand
what
was
expected
of
suddenly
he
seemed
to
a
scarcely
perceptible
smile
flashed
across
his
puffy
and
bowing
low
and
respectfully
he
took
the
object
that
lay
on
the
it
was
the
order
of
george
of
the
first
chapter
xi
next
day
the
field
marshal
gave
a
dinner
and
ball
which
the
emperor
honored
by
his
kutuzov
had
received
the
order
of
george
of
the
first
class
and
the
emperor
showed
him
the
highest
but
everyone
knew
of
the
imperial
dissatisfaction
with
the
proprieties
were
observed
and
the
emperor
was
the
first
to
set
that
but
everybody
understood
that
the
old
man
was
blameworthy
and
when
conforming
to
a
custom
of
ordered
the
standards
that
had
been
captured
to
be
lowered
at
the
feet
on
his
entering
the
the
emperor
made
a
wry
face
and
muttered
something
in
which
some
people
caught
the
old
the
displeasure
with
kutuzov
was
specially
increased
at
vilna
by
the
fact
that
kutuzov
evidently
could
not
or
would
not
understand
the
importance
of
the
coming
when
on
the
following
morning
the
emperor
said
to
the
officers
assembled
about
have
not
only
saved
you
have
saved
they
all
understood
that
the
war
was
not
kutuzov
alone
would
not
see
this
and
openly
expressed
his
opinion
that
no
fresh
war
could
improve
the
position
or
add
to
the
glory
of

could
only
spoil

naturally
regarded
as

cutting

to
him
from
the
time
of
his
rescue
till
his
he
remembered
only
the
dull
gray
weather
now
rainy
and
now
internal
physical
and
pains
in
his
feet
and
he
remembered
a
general
impression
of
the
misfortunes
and
sufferings
of
people
and
of
being
worried
by
the
curiosity
of
officers
and
generals
who
questioned
he
also
remembered
his
difficulty
in
procuring
a
conveyance
and
and
above
all
he
remembered
his
incapacity
to
think
and
feel
all
that
on
the
day
of
his
rescue
he
had
seen
the
body
of
petya
that
same
day
he
had
learned
that
prince
after
surviving
the
battle
of
borodino
for
more
than
a
month
had
recently
died
in
the
house
at
and
denisov
who
told
him
this
news
also
mentioned
supposing
that
pierre
had
heard
of
it
long
all
this
at
the
time
seemed
merely
strange
to
he
felt
he
could
not
grasp
its
just
then
he
was
only
anxious
to
get
away
as
quickly
as
possible
from
places
where
people
were
killing
one
to
some
peaceful
refuge
where
he
could
recover
and
think
over
all
the
strange
new
facts
he
had
but
on
reaching
orel
he
immediately
fell
when
he
came
to
himself
after
his
illness
he
saw
in
attendance
on
him
two
of
his
terenty
and
who
had
come
from
and
also
his
cousin
the
eldest
who
had
been
living
on
his
estate
at
elets
and
hearing
of
his
rescue
and
illness
had
come
to
look
after
it
was
only
gradually
during
his
convalescence
that
pierre
lost
the
impressions
he
had
become
accustomed
to
during
the
last
few
months
and
got
used
to
the
idea
that
no
one
would
oblige
him
to
go
anywhere
that
no
one
would
deprive
him
of
his
warm
and
that
he
would
be
sure
to
get
his
and
but
for
a
long
time
in
his
dreams
he
still
saw
himself
in
the
conditions
of
in
the
same
way
little
by
little
he
came
to
understand
the
news
he
had
been
told
after
his
about
the
death
of
prince
the
death
of
his
and
the
destruction
of
the
a
joyous
feeling
of
complete
inalienable
freedom
natural
to
man
which
he
had
first
experienced
at
the
first
halt
outside
filled
soul
during
his
he
was
surprised
to
find
that
this
inner
which
was
independent
of
external
now
had
as
it
were
an
additional
setting
of
external
he
was
alone
in
a
strange
without
no
one
demanded
anything
of
him
or
sent
him
he
had
all
he
the
thought
of
his
wife
which
had
been
a
continual
torment
to
him
was
no
longer
since
she
was
no
how
how
said
he
to
himself
when
a
cleanly
laid
table
was
moved
up
to
him
with
savory
beef
or
when
he
lay
down
for
the
night
on
a
soft
clean
or
when
he
remembered
that
the
french
had
gone
and
that
his
wife
was
no
how
how
and
by
old
habit
he
asked
himself
the
and
what
what
am
i
going
to
and
he
immediately
gave
himself
the
i
shall
how
the
very
question
that
had
formerly
tormented
the
thing
he
had
continually
sought
to
aim
of
longer
existed
for
him
that
search
for
the
aim
of
life
had
not
merely
disappeared
felt
that
it
no
longer
existed
for
him
and
could
not
present
itself
and
this
very
absence
of
an
aim
gave
him
the
joyous
sense
of
freedom
which
constituted
his
happiness
at
this
he
could
not
see
an
for
he
now
had
faith
in
any
kind
of
or
or
but
faith
in
an
formerly
he
had
sought
him
in
aims
he
set
that
search
for
an
aim
had
been
simply
a
search
for
and
suddenly
in
his
captivity
he
had
learned
not
by
words
or
reasoning
but
by
direct
feeling
what
his
nurse
had
told
him
long
that
god
is
here
and
in
his
captivity
he
had
learned
that
in
karataev
god
was
more
infinite
and
unfathomable
than
in
the
architect
of
the
universe
recognized
by
the
he
felt
like
a
man
who
after
straining
his
eyes
to
see
into
the
far
distance
finds
what
he
sought
at
his
very
all
his
life
he
had
looked
over
the
heads
of
the
men
around
when
he
should
have
merely
looked
in
front
of
him
without
straining
his
in
the
past
he
had
never
been
able
to
find
that
great
inscrutable
infinite
he
had
only
felt
that
it
must
exist
somewhere
and
had
looked
for
in
everything
near
and
comprehensible
he
had
only
what
was
and
he
had
equipped
himself
with
a
mental
telescope
and
looked
into
remote
where
petty
worldliness
hiding
itself
in
misty
distance
had
seemed
to
him
great
and
infinite
merely
because
it
was
not
clearly
and
such
had
european
and
philanthropy
seemed
to
but
even
at
moments
of
weakness
as
he
had
accounted
his
mind
had
penetrated
to
those
distances
and
he
had
there
seen
the
same
and
he
had
learned
to
see
the
and
infinite
in
and
see
it
and
enjoy
its
naturally
threw
away
the
telescope
through
which
he
had
till
now
gazed
over
and
gladly
regarded
the
eternally
and
infinite
life
around
and
the
closer
he
looked
the
more
tranquil
and
happy
he
that
dreadful
which
had
formerly
destroyed
all
his
mental
no
longer
existed
for
to
that
a
simple
answer
was
now
always
ready
in
his
there
is
a
that
god
without
whose
will
not
one
hair
falls
from
a
chapter
xiii
in
external
ways
pierre
had
hardly
changed
at
in
appearance
he
was
just
what
he
used
to
as
before
he
was
and
seemed
occupied
not
with
what
was
before
his
eyes
but
with
something
special
of
his
the
difference
between
his
former
and
present
self
was
that
formerly
when
he
did
not
grasp
what
lay
before
him
or
was
said
to
he
had
puckered
his
forehead
painfully
as
if
vainly
seeking
to
distinguish
something
at
a
at
present
he
still
forgot
what
was
said
to
him
and
still
did
not
see
what
was
before
his
but
he
now
looked
with
a
scarcely
perceptible
and
seemingly
ironic
smile
at
what
was
before
him
and
listened
to
what
was
though
evidently
seeing
and
hearing
something
quite
formerly
he
had
appeared
to
be
a
kindhearted
but
unhappy
and
so
people
had
been
inclined
to
avoid
now
a
smile
at
the
joy
of
life
always
played
round
his
and
sympathy
for
shone
in
his
eyes
with
a
questioning
look
as
to
whether
they
were
as
contented
as
he
and
people
felt
pleased
by
his
previously
he
had
talked
a
great
grew
excited
when
he
and
seldom
now
he
was
seldom
carried
away
in
conversation
and
knew
how
to
listen
so
that
people
readily
told
him
their
most
intimate
the
who
had
never
liked
pierre
and
had
been
particularly
hostile
to
him
since
she
had
felt
herself
under
obligations
to
him
after
the
old
now
after
staying
a
short
time
in
she
had
come
intending
to
show
pierre
that
in
spite
of
his
ingratitude
she
considered
it
her
duty
to
nurse
to
her
surprise
and
vexation
that
she
had
become
fond
of
pierre
did
not
in
any
way
seek
her
he
merely
studied
her
with
formerly
she
had
felt
that
he
regarded
her
with
indifference
and
and
so
had
shrunk
into
herself
as
she
did
with
others
and
had
shown
him
only
the
combative
side
of
her
but
now
he
seemed
to
be
trying
to
understand
the
most
intimate
places
of
her
mistrustfully
at
first
but
afterwards
she
let
him
see
the
kindly
sides
of
her
the
most
cunning
man
could
not
have
crept
into
her
confidence
more
evoking
memories
of
the
best
times
of
her
youth
and
showing
sympathy
with
yet
cunning
consisted
simply
in
finding
pleasure
in
drawing
out
the
human
qualities
of
the
and
her
own
proud
he
is
a
very
kind
man
when
he
is
not
under
the
influence
of
bad
people
but
of
people
such
as
thought
his
servants
and
their
own
way
noticed
the
change
that
had
taken
place
in
they
considered
that
he
had
become
much
when
he
had
helped
him
undress
and
wished
him
good
often
lingered
with
his
boots
in
his
hands
and
clothes
over
his
to
see
whether
he
would
not
start
a
and
noticing
that
terenty
wanted
a
generally
kept
him
tell
how
did
you
get
he
would
and
terenty
would
begin
talking
of
the
destruction
of
and
of
the
old
and
would
stand
for
a
long
time
holding
the
clothes
and
or
sometimes
listening
to
and
then
would
go
out
into
the
hall
with
a
pleasant
sense
of
intimacy
with
his
master
and
affection
for
the
doctor
who
attended
pierre
and
visited
him
every
though
he
considered
it
his
duty
as
a
doctor
to
pose
as
a
man
whose
every
moment
was
of
value
to
suffering
would
sit
for
hours
with
pierre
telling
him
his
favorite
anecdotes
and
his
observations
on
the
characters
of
his
patients
in
and
especially
of
the
a
pleasure
to
talk
to
a
man
like
he
is
not
like
our
he
would
there
were
several
prisoners
from
the
french
army
in
and
the
doctor
brought
one
of
a
young
to
see
this
officer
began
visiting
and
the
princess
used
to
make
fun
of
the
tenderness
the
italian
expressed
for
the
italian
seemed
happy
only
when
he
could
come
to
see
talk
with
tell
him
about
his
his
life
at
and
his
and
pour
out
to
him
his
indignation
against
the
french
and
especially
against
all
russians
are
in
the
least
like
it
is
sacrilege
to
fight
such
a
he
said
to
who
have
suffered
so
from
the
do
not
even
feel
animosity
toward
pierre
had
evoked
the
passionate
affection
of
the
italian
merely
by
evoking
the
best
side
of
his
nature
and
taking
a
pleasure
in
so
during
the
last
days
of
stay
in
orel
his
old
masonic
acquaintance
count
who
had
introduced
him
to
the
lodge
in
came
to
see
willarski
was
married
to
a
russian
heiress
who
had
a
large
estate
in
orel
and
he
occupied
a
temporary
post
in
the
commissariat
department
in
that
hearing
that
bezukhov
was
in
though
they
had
never
been
came
to
him
with
the
professions
of
friendship
and
intimacy
that
people
who
meet
in
a
desert
generally
express
for
one
willarski
felt
dull
in
orel
and
was
pleased
to
meet
a
man
of
his
own
circle
as
he
of
similar
but
to
his
surprise
willarski
soon
noticed
that
pierre
had
lagged
much
behind
the
and
had
as
he
expressed
it
to
into
apathy
and
are
letting
yourself
my
dear
he
but
for
all
that
willarski
found
it
pleasanter
now
than
it
had
been
formerly
to
be
with
and
came
to
see
him
every
to
pierre
as
he
looked
at
and
listened
to
it
seemed
strange
to
think
that
he
had
been
like
that
himself
but
a
short
time
willarski
was
a
married
man
with
a
busy
with
his
family
his
and
his
official
he
regarded
all
these
occupations
as
hindrances
to
and
considered
that
they
were
all
contemptible
because
their
aim
was
the
welfare
of
himself
and
his
and
masonic
interests
continually
absorbed
his
and
without
trying
to
change
the
views
and
without
condemning
but
with
the
and
amused
smile
now
habitual
to
was
interested
in
this
strange
though
very
familiar
there
was
a
new
feature
in
relations
with
with
the
with
the
and
with
all
the
people
he
now
which
gained
for
him
the
general
good
this
was
his
acknowledgment
of
the
impossibility
of
changing
a
convictions
by
and
his
recognition
of
the
possibility
of
everyone
and
seeing
things
each
from
his
own
point
of
this
legitimate
peculiarity
of
each
individual
which
used
to
excite
and
irritate
pierre
now
became
a
basis
of
the
sympathy
he
felt
and
the
interest
he
took
other
the
and
sometimes
complete
between
opinions
and
their
and
between
one
man
and
pleased
him
and
drew
from
him
an
amused
and
gentle
in
practical
matters
pierre
unexpectedly
felt
within
himself
a
center
of
gravity
he
had
previously
formerly
all
pecuniary
especially
requests
for
money
to
as
an
extremely
wealthy
he
was
very
produced
in
him
a
state
of
hopeless
agitation
and
give
or
not
to
he
had
asked
have
it
and
he
needs
but
someone
else
needs
it
still
who
needs
it
and
perhaps
they
are
both
in
the
old
days
he
had
been
unable
to
find
a
way
out
of
all
these
surmises
and
had
given
to
all
who
asked
as
long
as
he
had
anything
to
formerly
he
had
been
in
a
similar
state
of
perplexity
with
regard
to
every
question
concerning
his
when
one
person
advised
one
thing
and
another
something
now
to
his
surprise
he
found
that
he
no
longer
felt
either
doubt
or
perplexity
about
these
there
was
now
within
him
a
judge
who
by
some
rule
unknown
to
him
decided
what
should
or
should
not
be
he
was
as
indifferent
as
heretofore
to
money
but
now
he
felt
certain
of
what
ought
and
what
ought
not
to
be
the
first
time
he
had
recourse
to
his
new
judge
was
when
a
french
a
came
to
him
after
talking
a
great
deal
about
his
concluded
by
making
what
amounted
to
a
demand
that
pierre
should
give
him
four
thousand
francs
to
send
to
his
wife
and
pierre
refused
without
the
least
difficulty
or
and
was
afterwards
surprised
how
simple
and
easy
had
been
what
used
to
appear
so
insurmountably
at
the
same
time
that
he
refused
the
demand
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
must
have
recourse
to
artifice
when
leaving
to
induce
the
italian
officer
to
accept
some
money
of
which
he
was
evidently
in
a
further
proof
to
pierre
of
his
own
more
settled
outlook
on
practical
matters
was
furnished
by
his
decision
with
regard
to
his
debts
and
to
the
rebuilding
of
his
houses
in
and
near
his
head
steward
came
to
him
at
orel
and
pierre
reckoned
up
with
him
his
diminished
the
burning
of
moscow
had
cost
according
to
the
head
about
two
million
to
console
pierre
for
these
losses
the
head
steward
gave
him
an
estimate
showing
that
despite
these
losses
his
income
would
not
be
diminished
but
would
even
be
increased
if
he
refused
to
pay
his
debts
which
he
was
under
no
obligation
to
and
did
not
rebuild
his
moscow
house
and
the
country
house
on
his
moscow
which
had
cost
him
eighty
thousand
rubles
a
year
and
brought
in
of
course
said
pierre
with
a
cheerful
need
all
that
at
by
being
ruined
i
have
become
much
but
in
january
savelich
came
from
moscow
and
gave
him
an
account
of
the
state
of
things
and
spoke
of
the
estimate
an
architect
had
made
of
the
cost
of
rebuilding
the
town
and
country
speaking
of
this
as
of
a
settled
about
the
same
time
he
received
letters
from
prince
vasili
and
other
petersburg
acquaintances
speaking
of
his
and
pierre
decided
that
the
proposals
which
had
so
pleased
him
were
wrong
and
that
he
must
go
to
petersburg
and
settle
his
affairs
and
must
rebuild
in
why
this
was
necessary
he
did
not
but
he
knew
for
certain
that
it
was
his
income
would
be
reduced
by
three
but
he
felt
it
must
be
willarski
was
going
to
moscow
and
they
agreed
to
travel
during
the
whole
time
of
his
convalescence
in
orel
pierre
had
experienced
a
feeling
of
and
but
when
during
his
journey
he
found
himself
in
the
open
world
and
saw
hundreds
of
new
that
feeling
was
throughout
his
journey
he
felt
like
a
schoolboy
on
stagecoach
the
the
peasants
on
the
roads
and
in
the
a
new
significance
for
the
presence
and
remarks
of
willarski
who
continually
deplored
the
ignorance
and
poverty
of
russia
and
its
backwardness
compared
with
europe
only
heightened
where
willarski
saw
deadness
pierre
saw
an
extraordinary
strength
and
strength
which
in
that
vast
space
amid
the
snows
maintained
the
life
of
this
and
unique
he
did
not
contradict
willarski
and
even
seemed
to
agree
with
apparent
agreement
being
the
simplest
way
to
avoid
discussions
that
could
lead
to
he
smiled
joyfully
as
he
listened
to
chapter
xiv
it
would
be
difficult
to
explain
why
and
whither
ants
whose
heap
has
been
destroyed
are
some
from
the
heap
dragging
bits
of
and
others
back
to
the
or
why
they
overtake
one
and
and
it
would
be
equally
difficult
to
explain
what
caused
the
russians
after
the
departure
of
the
french
to
throng
to
the
place
that
had
formerly
been
but
when
we
watch
the
ants
round
their
ruined
the
and
immense
number
of
the
delving
insects
prove
that
despite
the
destruction
of
the
something
which
though
intangible
is
the
real
strength
of
the
still
and
though
in
moscow
in
the
month
of
october
there
was
no
government
and
no
or
was
still
the
moscow
it
had
been
in
all
was
except
something
intangible
yet
powerful
and
the
motives
of
those
who
thronged
from
all
sides
to
moscow
after
it
had
been
cleared
of
the
enemy
were
most
diverse
and
and
at
first
for
the
most
part
savage
and
one
motive
only
they
all
had
in
a
desire
to
get
to
the
place
that
had
been
called
to
apply
their
activities
within
a
week
moscow
already
had
fifteen
thousand
in
a
fortnight
and
so
by
the
autumn
of
1813
the
ever
increasing
and
exceeded
what
it
had
been
in
the
first
russians
to
enter
moscow
were
the
cossacks
of
peasants
from
the
adjacent
and
residents
who
had
fled
from
moscow
and
had
been
hiding
in
its
the
russians
who
entered
finding
it
plundered
it
in
their
they
continued
what
the
french
had
trains
of
peasant
carts
came
to
moscow
to
carry
off
to
the
villages
what
had
been
abandoned
in
the
ruined
houses
and
the
the
cossacks
carried
off
what
they
could
to
their
and
the
householders
seized
all
they
could
find
in
other
houses
and
moved
it
to
their
pretending
that
it
was
their
but
the
first
plunderers
were
followed
by
a
second
and
a
third
and
with
increasing
numbers
plundering
became
more
and
more
difficult
and
assumed
more
definite
the
french
found
moscow
abandoned
but
with
all
the
organizations
of
regular
with
diverse
branches
of
commerce
and
with
and
governmental
and
religious
these
forms
were
lifeless
but
still
there
were
market
the
most
part
still
stocked
with
and
there
were
factories
and
palaces
and
wealthy
houses
filled
with
government
and
the
longer
the
french
remained
the
more
these
forms
of
town
life
until
finally
all
was
merged
into
one
lifeless
scene
of
the
more
the
plundering
by
the
french
the
more
both
the
wealth
of
moscow
and
the
strength
of
its
plunderers
was
but
plundering
by
the
with
which
the
reoccupation
of
the
city
had
an
opposite

longer
it
continued
and
the
greater
the
number
of
people
taking
part

of

pierre
went
to
moscow
and
stayed
in
an
annex
of
his
house
which
had
not
been
he
called
on
count
rostopchin
and
on
some
acquaintances
who
were
back
in
and
he
intended
to
leave
for
petersburg
two
days
everybody
was
celebrating
the
everything
was
bubbling
with
life
in
the
ruined
but
reviving
everyone
was
pleased
to
see
everyone
wished
to
meet
and
everyone
questioned
him
about
what
he
had
pierre
felt
particularly
well
disposed
toward
them
but
was
now
instinctively
on
his
guard
for
fear
of
binding
himself
in
any
to
all
questions
put
to
whether
important
or
quite
where
would
he
was
he
going
to
when
was
he
going
to
petersburg
and
would
he
mind
taking
a
parcel
for
think
and
so
he
had
heard
that
the
rostovs
were
at
kostroma
but
the
thought
of
natasha
seldom
occurred
to
if
it
did
it
was
only
as
a
pleasant
memory
of
the
distant
he
felt
himself
not
only
free
from
social
obligations
but
also
from
that
feeling
it
seemed
to
he
had
aroused
in
on
the
third
day
after
his
arrival
he
heard
from
the
drubetskoys
that
princess
mary
was
in
the
and
last
days
of
prince
andrew
had
often
occupied
thoughts
and
now
recurred
to
him
with
fresh
having
heard
at
dinner
that
princess
mary
was
in
moscow
and
living
in
her
had
not
been
vozdvizhenka
he
drove
that
same
evening
to
see
on
his
way
to
the
house
pierre
kept
thinking
of
prince
of
their
of
his
various
meetings
with
and
especially
of
the
last
one
at
it
possible
that
he
died
in
the
bitter
frame
of
mind
he
was
then
is
it
possible
that
the
meaning
of
life
was
not
disclosed
to
him
before
he
thought
he
recalled
karataev
and
his
death
and
involuntarily
began
to
compare
these
two
so
and
yet
so
similar
in
that
they
had
both
lived
and
both
died
and
in
the
love
he
felt
for
both
of
pierre
drove
up
to
the
house
of
the
old
prince
in
a
most
serious
the
house
had
escaped
the
it
showed
signs
of
damage
but
its
general
aspect
was
the
old
who
met
pierre
with
a
stern
face
as
if
wishing
to
make
the
visitor
feel
that
the
absence
of
the
old
prince
had
not
disturbed
the
order
of
things
in
the
informed
him
that
the
princess
had
gone
to
her
own
and
that
she
received
on
perhaps
she
will
see
said
said
the
step
into
the
portrait
a
few
minutes
later
the
footman
returned
with
who
brought
word
from
the
princess
that
she
would
be
very
glad
to
see
pierre
if
he
would
excuse
her
want
of
ceremony
and
come
upstairs
to
her
in
a
rather
low
room
lit
by
one
candle
sat
the
princess
and
with
her
another
person
dressed
in
pierre
remembered
that
the
princess
always
had
lady
but
who
they
were
and
what
they
were
like
he
never
knew
or
must
be
one
of
her
he
glancing
at
the
lady
in
the
black
the
princess
rose
quickly
to
meet
him
and
held
out
her
she
looking
at
his
altered
face
after
he
had
kissed
her
this
is
how
we
meet
he
spoke
of
you
even
at
the
very
she
went
turning
her
eyes
from
pierre
to
her
companion
with
a
shyness
that
surprised
him
for
an
was
so
glad
to
hear
of
your
it
was
the
first
piece
of
good
news
we
had
received
for
a
long
again
the
princess
glanced
round
at
her
companion
with
even
more
uneasiness
in
her
manner
and
was
about
to
add
but
pierre
interrupted
knew
nothing
about
said
thought
he
had
been
all
i
know
i
heard
at
second
hand
from
i
only
know
that
he
fell
in
with
the
what
a
strange
pierre
spoke
rapidly
and
with
he
glanced
once
at
the
saw
her
attentive
and
kindly
gaze
fixed
on
as
often
happens
when
one
is
felt
somehow
that
this
companion
in
the
black
dress
was
a
excellent
creature
who
would
not
hinder
his
conversing
freely
with
princess
but
when
he
mentioned
the
princess
face
expressed
still
greater
she
again
glanced
rapidly
from
face
to
that
of
the
lady
in
the
black
dress
and
you
really
not
recognize
pierre
looked
again
at
the
delicate
face
with
its
black
eyes
and
peculiar
and
something
near
to
long
forgotten
and
more
than
looked
at
him
from
those
attentive
it
he
pale
face
that
looks
so
much
it
cannot
be
it
merely
reminds
me
of
but
at
that
moment
princess
mary
and
with
and
like
the
opening
of
a
door
grown
rusty
on
its
a
smile
appeared
on
the
face
with
the
attentive
and
from
that
opening
door
came
a
breath
of
fragrance
which
suffused
pierre
with
a
happiness
he
had
long
forgotten
and
of
which
he
had
not
even
been
at
that
it
suffused
seized
and
enveloped
him
when
she
smiled
doubt
was
no
longer
it
was
natasha
and
he
loved
at
that
moment
pierre
involuntarily
betrayed
to
to
princess
and
above
all
to
a
secret
of
which
he
himself
had
been
he
flushed
joyfully
yet
with
painful
he
tried
to
hide
his
but
the
more
he
tried
to
hide
it
the
more
than
any
words
could
have
he
betray
to
to
and
to
princess
mary
that
he
loved
only
the
unexpectedness
of
thought
but
as
soon
as
he
tried
to
continue
the
conversation
he
had
begun
with
princess
mary
he
again
glanced
at
and
a
flush
suffused
his
face
and
a
agitation
of
mingled
joy
and
fear
seized
his
he
became
confused
in
his
speech
and
stopped
in
the
middle
of
what
he
was
pierre
had
failed
to
notice
natasha
because
he
did
not
at
all
expect
to
see
her
but
he
had
failed
to
recognize
her
because
the
change
in
her
since
he
last
saw
her
was
she
had
grown
thin
and
but
that
was
not
what
made
her
she
was
unrecognizable
at
the
moment
he
entered
because
on
that
face
whose
eyes
had
always
shone
with
a
suppressed
smile
of
the
joy
of
now
when
he
first
entered
and
glanced
at
her
there
was
not
the
least
shadow
of
a
only
her
eyes
were
kindly
attentive
and
sadly
confusion
was
not
reflected
by
any
confusion
on
but
only
by
the
pleasure
that
just
perceptibly
lit
up
her
whole
chapter
xvi
has
come
to
stay
with
said
princess
count
and
countess
will
be
here
in
a
few
the
countess
is
in
a
dreadful
but
it
was
necessary
for
natasha
herself
to
see
a
they
insisted
on
her
coming
with
is
there
a
family
free
from
sorrow
said
addressing
know
it
happened
the
very
day
we
were
i
saw
what
a
delightful
boy
he
natasha
looked
at
and
by
way
of
answer
to
his
words
her
eyes
widened
and
lit
can
one
say
or
think
of
as
a
said
why
had
such
a
splendid
so
full
of
to
in
these
days
it
would
be
hard
to
live
without
remarked
princess
that
is
really
pierre
hastily
interrupted
is
it
natasha
looking
attentively
into
can
you
ask
said
princess
thought
alone
of
what
natasha
without
waiting
for
princess
mary
to
finish
again
looked
inquiringly
at
pierre
one
who
believes
that
there
is
a
god
ruling
us
can
bear
a
loss
such
as
hers
natasha
had
already
opened
her
mouth
to
speak
but
suddenly
pierre
hurriedly
turned
away
from
her
and
again
addressed
princess
asking
about
his
last
confusion
had
now
almost
but
at
the
same
time
he
felt
that
his
freedom
had
also
completely
he
felt
that
there
was
now
a
judge
of
his
every
word
and
action
whose
judgment
mattered
more
to
him
than
that
of
all
the
rest
of
the
as
he
spoke
now
he
was
considering
what
impression
his
words
would
make
on
he
did
not
purposely
say
things
to
please
but
whatever
he
was
saying
he
regarded
from
her
princess
as
is
usual
in
such
telling
of
the
condition
in
which
she
had
found
prince
but
face
quivering
with
his
questions
and
his
eager
restless
gradually
compelled
her
to
go
into
details
which
she
feared
to
recall
for
her
own
and
pierre
kept
saying
as
he
leaned
toward
her
with
his
whole
body
and
eagerly
listened
to
her
so
he
grew
tranquil
and
with
all
his
soul
he
had
always
sought
one
be
perfectly
he
could
not
be
afraid
of
the
faults
he
he
had
not
of
his
so
he
did
what
a
happy
thing
that
he
saw
you
he
suddenly
turning
to
natasha
and
looking
at
her
with
eyes
full
of
face
she
frowned
and
lowered
her
eyes
for
a
she
hesitated
for
an
instant
whether
to
speak
or
that
was
she
then
said
in
her
quiet
voice
with
its
deep
chest
me
it
certainly
was
she
he
said
he
was
wishing
for
it
at
the
very
moment
i
entered
the
voice
she
pressed
her
clasped
hands
on
her
and
then
controlling
herself
with
an
evident
effort
lifted
her
head
and
began
to
speak
knew
nothing
of
it
when
we
started
from
i
did
not
dare
to
ask
about
then
suddenly
sonya
told
me
he
was
traveling
with
i
had
no
idea
and
could
not
imagine
what
state
he
was
all
i
wanted
was
to
see
him
and
be
with
she
and
breathing
and
not
letting
them
interrupt
her
she
went
on
to
tell
what
she
had
never
yet
mentioned
to
she
had
lived
through
during
those
three
weeks
of
their
journey
and
life
at
pierre
listened
to
her
with
lips
parted
and
eyes
fixed
upon
her
full
of
as
he
listened
he
did
not
think
of
prince
nor
of
nor
of
what
she
was
he
listened
to
her
and
felt
only
pity
for
for
what
she
was
suffering
now
while
she
was
princess
frowning
in
her
effort
to
hold
back
her
sat
beside
and
heard
for
the
first
time
the
story
of
those
last
days
of
her
and
evidently
natasha
needed
to
tell
that
painful
yet
joyful
she
mingling
most
trifling
details
with
the
intimate
secrets
of
her
and
it
seemed
as
if
she
could
never
several
times
she
repeated
the
same
thing
voice
was
heard
outside
the
door
asking
whether
little
nicholas
might
come
in
to
say
good
said
she
got
up
quickly
just
as
nicholas
almost
ran
to
the
door
which
was
hidden
by
struck
her
head
against
and
rushed
from
the
room
with
a
moan
either
of
pain
or
pierre
gazed
at
the
door
through
which
she
had
disappeared
and
did
not
understand
why
he
suddenly
felt
all
alone
in
the
princess
mary
roused
him
from
his
abstraction
by
drawing
his
attention
to
her
nephew
who
had
entered
the
at
that
moment
of
emotional
tenderness
young
which
resembled
his
affected
pierre
so
much
that
when
he
had
kissed
the
boy
he
got
up
took
out
his
and
went
to
the
he
wished
to
take
leave
of
princess
but
she
would
not
let
him
natasha
and
i
sometimes
go
to
sleep
till
after
so
please
i
will
order
go
we
will
come
before
pierre
left
the
room
princess
mary
told
is
the
first
time
she
has
talked
of
him
like
chapter
xvii
pierre
was
shown
into
the
brightly
lit
dining
a
few
minutes
later
he
heard
footsteps
and
princess
mary
entered
with
natasha
was
though
a
severe
and
grave
expression
had
again
settled
on
her
they
all
three
of
them
now
experienced
that
feeling
of
awkwardness
which
usually
follows
after
a
serious
and
heartfelt
it
is
impossible
to
go
back
to
the
same
to
talk
of
trifles
is
and
yet
the
desire
to
speak
is
there
and
silence
seems
like
they
went
silently
to
the
footmen
drew
back
the
chairs
and
pushed
them
up
pierre
unfolded
his
cold
table
napkin
resolving
to
break
the
looked
at
natasha
and
at
princess
they
had
evidently
both
formed
the
same
the
eyes
of
both
shone
with
satisfaction
and
a
confession
that
besides
sorrow
life
also
has
you
take
asked
princess
and
those
words
suddenly
banished
the
shadows
of
the
tell
us
about
said

such
improbable
wonders
about
replied
pierre
with
the
smile
of
mild
irony
now
habitual
to
even
tell
me
wonders
i
myself
never
dreamed
mary
abramovna
invited
me
to
her
house
and
kept
telling
me
what
had
or
ought
to
have
to
stepan
stepanych
also
instructed
me
how
i
ought
to
tell
of
my
in
general
i
have
noticed
that
it
is
very
easy
to
be
an
interesting
man
am
an
interesting
man
people
invite
me
out
and
tell
me
all
about
natasha
smiled
and
was
on
the
point
of
have
been
princess
mary
interrupted
you
lost
two
millions
in
is
that
i
am
three
times
as
rich
as
returned
though
the
position
was
now
altered
by
his
decision
to
pay
his
debts
and
to
rebuild
his
pierre
still
maintained
that
he
had
become
three
times
as
rich
as
i
have
certainly
gained
is
he
began
but
did
not
noticing
that
this
theme
was
too
are
you
savelich
says
i
you
did
not
know
of
the
death
when
you
decided
to
remain
in
asked
princess
mary
and
immediately
noticing
that
her
following
his
mention
of
ascribed
to
his
words
a
meaning
he
had
perhaps
not
answered
evidently
not
considering
awkward
the
meaning
princess
mary
had
given
to
his
heard
of
it
in
orel
and
you
cannot
imagine
how
it
shocked
we
were
not
an
exemplary
he
added
glancing
at
natasha
and
noticing
on
her
face
curiosity
as
to
how
he
would
speak
of
his
her
death
shocked
me
when
two
people
quarrel
they
are
always
both
in
and
own
guilt
suddenly
becomes
terribly
serious
when
the
other
is
no
longer
and
then
such
a
without
friends
and
without
i
am
very
sorry
for
he
and
was
pleased
to
notice
a
look
of
glad
approval
on
and
so
you
are
once
more
an
eligible
said
princess
pierre
suddenly
flushed
crimson
and
for
a
long
time
tried
not
to
look
at
when
he
ventured
to
glance
her
way
again
her
face
was
and
he
fancied
even
did
you
really
see
and
speak
to
as
we
have
been
said
princess
pierre
not
everybody
seems
to
imagine
that
being
taken
prisoner
means
being
not
only
did
i
never
see
him
but
i
heard
nothing
about
was
in
much
lower
supper
was
and
pierre
who
at
first
declined
to
speak
about
his
captivity
was
gradually
led
on
to
do
true
that
you
remained
in
moscow
to
kill
natasha
asked
with
a
slight
guessed
it
then
when
we
met
at
the
sukharev
do
you
pierre
admitted
that
it
was
and
from
that
was
gradually
led
by
princess
questions
and
especially
by
into
giving
a
detailed
account
of
his
at
first
he
spoke
with
the
amused
and
mild
irony
now
customary
with
him
toward
everybody
and
especially
toward
but
when
he
came
to
describe
the
horrors
and
sufferings
he
had
witnessed
he
was
unconsciously
carried
away
and
began
speaking
with
the
suppressed
emotion
of
a
man
in
recollection
strong
impressions
he
has
lived
princess
mary
with
a
gentle
smile
looked
now
at
pierre
and
now
at
in
the
whole
narrative
she
saw
only
pierre
and
his
leaning
on
her
the
expression
of
her
face
constantly
changing
with
the
watched
pierre
with
an
attention
that
never
herself
experiencing
all
that
he
not
only
her
but
her
exclamations
and
the
brief
questions
she
showed
pierre
that
she
understood
just
what
he
wished
to
it
was
clear
that
she
understood
not
only
what
he
said
but
also
what
he
wished
but
could
express
in
the
account
pierre
gave
of
the
incident
with
the
child
and
the
woman
for
protecting
whom
he
was
arrested
was
was
an
awful
some
in
the
one
was
snatched
out
before
my
and
there
were
women
who
had
their
things
snatched
off
and
their
earrings
torn
he
flushed
and
grew
a
patrol
arrived
and
all
the
those
who
were
not
that
and
i
among
am
sure
not
telling
us
i
am
sure
you
did
said
natasha
and
pausing
pierre
when
he
spoke
of
the
execution
he
wanted
to
pass
over
the
horrible
but
natasha
insisted
that
he
should
not
omit
pierre
began
to
tell
about
but
by
this
time
he
had
risen
from
the
table
and
was
pacing
the
natasha
following
him
with
her
then
he
you
understand
what
i
learned
from
that
illiterate
simple
go
said
is
killed
him
almost
before
my
and
his
voice
trembling
went
on
to
tell
of
the
last
days
of
their
of
illness
and
his
he
told
of
his
adventures
as
he
had
never
yet
recalled
he
as
it
saw
a
new
meaning
in
all
he
had
gone
now
that
he
was
telling
it
all
to
natasha
he
experienced
that
pleasure
which
a
man
has
when
women
listen
to
clever
women
who
when
listening
either
try
to
remember
what
they
hear
to
enrich
their
minds
and
when
opportunity
offers
to
retell
or
who
wish
to
adopt
it
to
some
thought
of
their
own
and
promptly
contribute
their
own
clever
comments
prepared
in
their
little
mental
the
pleasure
given
by
real
women
gifted
with
a
capacity
to
select
and
absorb
the
very
best
a
man
shows
of
natasha
without
knowing
it
was
all
she
did
not
lose
a
no
single
quiver
in
no
no
twitch
of
a
muscle
in
his
nor
a
single
she
caught
the
unfinished
word
in
its
flight
and
took
it
straight
into
her
open
divining
the
secret
meaning
of
all
mental
princess
mary
understood
his
story
and
sympathized
with
but
she
now
saw
something
else
that
absorbed
all
her
she
saw
the
possibility
of
love
and
happiness
between
natasha
and
and
the
first
thought
of
this
filled
her
heart
with
it
was
three
in
the
the
footmen
came
in
with
sad
and
stern
faces
to
change
the
but
no
one
noticed
pierre
finished
his
natasha
continued
to
look
at
him
intently
with
and
animated
as
if
trying
to
understand
something
more
which
he
had
perhaps
left
pierre
in
shamefaced
and
happy
confusion
glanced
occasionally
at
and
tried
to
think
what
to
say
next
to
introduce
a
fresh
princess
mary
was
it
occurred
to
none
of
them
that
it
was
three
and
time
to
go
to
speak
of
misfortunes
and
remarked
if
at
this
moment
i
were
you
rather
be
what
you
were
before
you
were
taken
or
go
through
all
this
then
for
sake
let
me
again
have
captivity
and
we
imagine
that
when
we
are
thrown
out
of
our
usual
ruts
all
is
but
it
is
only
then
that
what
is
new
and
good
while
there
is
life
there
is
there
is
much
before
i
say
this
to
he
turning
to
she
answering
something
quite
too
should
wish
nothing
but
to
relive
it
all
from
the
pierre
looked
intently
at
and
nothing
said
not
not
cried
am
not
to
blame
for
being
alive
and
wishing
to
you
suddenly
natasha
bent
her
covered
her
face
with
her
and
began
to
is
said
princess
she
smiled
at
pierre
through
her
it
is
time
for
pierre
rose
and
took
his
princess
mary
and
natasha
met
as
usual
in
the
they
talked
of
what
pierre
had
told
princess
mary
did
not
express
her
opinion
of
pierre
nor
did
natasha
speak
of
good
said
you
i
am
often
afraid
that
by
not
speaking
of
meant
prince
fear
of
not
doing
justice
to
our
we
forget
princess
mary
sighed
deeply
and
thereby
acknowledged
the
justice
of
but
she
did
not
express
agreement
in
it
possible
to
said
did
me
so
much
good
to
tell
all
about
it
it
was
hard
and
but
very
said
am
sure
he
really
loved
that
is
why
i
told
was
it
all
she
suddenly
tell
what
a
splendid
man
he
said
princess
you
natasha
suddenly
said
with
a
mischievous
smile
such
as
princess
mary
had
not
seen
on
her
face
for
a
long
has
somehow
grown
so
and
if
he
had
just
come
out
of
a
russian
do
you
out
of
a
moral
it
replied
princess
has
greatly
a
short
coat
and
his
hair
just
as
just
as
if
he
had
come
straight
from
the
papa
used
understand
why
no
one
so
much
as
said
princess
and
yet
he
is
quite
they
say
men
are
friends
when
they
are
quite
that
must
be
really
he
is
quite
unlike
in
but
good
said
and
the
same
mischievous
smile
lingered
for
a
long
time
on
her
face
as
if
it
had
been
forgotten
chapter
xviii
it
was
a
long
time
before
pierre
could
fall
asleep
that
he
paced
up
and
down
his
now
turning
his
thoughts
on
a
difficult
problem
and
now
suddenly
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
and
now
smiling
he
was
thinking
of
prince
of
and
of
their
at
one
moment
jealous
of
her
then
reproaching
himself
for
that
it
was
already
six
in
the
morning
and
he
still
paced
up
and
down
the
to
be
done
if
it
cannot
be
to
be
evidently
it
has
to
be
said
he
to
and
hastily
undressing
he
got
into
happy
and
agitated
but
free
from
hesitation
or
and
impossible
as
such
happiness
i
must
do
everything
that
she
and
i
may
be
man
and
he
told
a
few
days
previously
pierre
had
decided
to
go
to
petersburg
on
the
when
he
awoke
on
the
savelich
came
to
ask
him
about
packing
for
the
to
what
is
who
is
there
in
he
asked
though
only
to
long
ago
before
this
happened
i
did
for
some
reason
mean
to
go
to
he
but
perhaps
i
shall
what
a
good
fellow
he
is
and
how
and
how
he
remembers
he
looking
at
old
what
a
pleasant
smile
he
do
you
still
not
wish
to
accept
your
pierre
asked
the
good
of
freedom
to
your
we
lived
under
the
late
kingdom
of
heaven
be
we
have
lived
under
you
without
ever
being
your
children
will
live
just
the
with
such
masters
one
can
what
about
my
said
i
suddenly
it
might
he
added
with
an
involuntary
i
may
take
the
your
it
would
be
a
good
easy
he
thinks
thought
know
how
terrible
it
is
and
how
too
soon
or
too
it
is
what
are
your
are
you
starting
asked
put
it
off
for
a
tell
you
you
must
forgive
the
trouble
i
have
put
you
said
and
seeing
savelich
he
how
strange
it
is
that
he
should
not
know
that
now
there
is
no
petersburg
for
and
that
that
must
be
settled
first
of
but
probably
he
knows
it
well
enough
and
is
only
shall
i
have
a
talk
with
him
and
see
what
he
pierre
another
at
breakfast
pierre
told
the
his
that
he
had
been
to
see
princess
mary
the
day
before
and
had
there
do
you
natasha
the
princess
seemed
to
see
nothing
more
extraordinary
in
that
than
if
he
had
seen
anna
you
know
asked
have
seen
the
she
heard
that
they
were
arranging
a
match
for
her
with
young
it
would
be
a
very
good
thing
for
the
they
are
said
to
be
utterly
i
mean
do
you
know
natasha
heard
about
that
affair
of
hers
at
the
it
was
a
great
she
either
understand
or
is
thought
not
say
anything
to
her
the
princess
too
had
prepared
provisions
for
kind
they
all
thought
is
surprising
is
that
they
should
trouble
about
these
things
now
when
it
can
no
longer
be
of
interest
to
and
all
for
on
the
same
day
the
chief
of
police
came
to
inviting
him
to
send
a
representative
to
the
faceted
palace
to
recover
things
that
were
to
be
returned
to
their
owners
that
this
man
thought
looking
into
the
face
of
the
chief
of
a
officer
and
how
fancy
bothering
about
such
trifles
and
they
actually
say
he
is
not
honest
and
takes
what
why
he
take
the
way
he
was
brought
and
everybody
does
but
what
a
pleasant
face
and
how
he
smiles
as
he
looks
at
pierre
went
to
princess
to
as
he
drove
through
the
streets
past
the
houses
that
had
been
burned
he
was
surprised
by
the
beauty
of
those
the
picturesqueness
of
the
chimney
stacks
and
walls
of
the
quarters
of
the
stretching
out
and
concealing
one
reminded
him
of
the
rhine
and
the
the
cabmen
he
met
and
their
the
carpenters
cutting
the
timber
for
new
houses
with
the
women
and
the
all
looked
at
him
with
cheerful
beaming
eyes
that
seemed
to
there
he
see
what
will
come
of
at
the
entrance
to
princess
house
pierre
felt
doubtful
whether
he
had
really
been
there
the
night
before
and
really
seen
natasha
and
talked
to
i
imagined
perhaps
i
shall
go
in
and
find
no
one
but
he
had
hardly
entered
the
room
before
he
felt
her
presence
with
his
whole
being
by
the
loss
of
his
sense
of
she
was
in
the
same
black
dress
with
soft
folds
and
her
hair
was
done
the
same
way
as
the
day
yet
she
was
quite
had
she
been
like
this
when
he
entered
the
day
before
he
could
not
for
a
moment
have
failed
to
recognize
she
was
as
he
had
known
her
almost
as
a
child
and
later
on
as
prince
a
bright
questioning
light
shone
in
her
and
on
her
face
was
a
friendly
and
strangely
roguish
pierre
dined
with
them
and
would
have
spent
the
whole
evening
but
princess
mary
was
going
to
vespers
and
pierre
left
the
house
with
next
day
he
came
and
stayed
the
whole
though
princess
mary
and
natasha
were
evidently
glad
to
see
their
visitor
and
though
all
interest
was
now
centered
in
that
by
the
evening
they
had
talked
over
everything
and
the
conversation
passed
from
one
trivial
topic
to
another
and
repeatedly
broke
he
stayed
so
long
that
princess
mary
and
natasha
exchanged
evidently
wondering
when
he
would
pierre
noticed
this
but
could
not
he
felt
uneasy
and
but
sat
on
because
he
simply
could
not
get
up
and
take
his
princess
foreseeing
no
end
to
rose
and
complaining
of
a
headache
began
to
say
good
you
are
going
to
petersburg
she
i
am
not
pierre
replied
in
a
surprised
tone
and
as
though
to
i
say
i
will
call
round
in
case
you
have
any
commissions
for
said
standing
before
princess
mary
and
turning
but
not
taking
his
natasha
gave
him
her
hand
and
went
princess
mary
on
the
other
hand
instead
of
going
away
sank
into
an
and
looked
sternly
and
intently
at
him
with
her
radiant
the
weariness
she
had
plainly
shown
before
had
now
quite
passed
with
a
deep
and
drawn
sigh
she
seemed
to
be
prepared
for
a
lengthy
when
natasha
left
the
room
confusion
and
awkwardness
immediately
vanished
and
were
replaced
by
eager
he
quickly
moved
an
armchair
toward
princess
i
wanted
to
tell
said
answering
her
look
as
if
she
had
help
what
am
i
to
can
i
my
dear
i
know
it
i
know
i
am
not
worthy
of
i
know
impossible
to
speak
of
it
but
i
want
to
be
a
brother
to
not
i
i
he
paused
and
rubbed
his
face
and
eyes
with
his
he
went
on
with
an
evident
effort
at
and
know
when
i
began
to
love
but
i
have
loved
her
and
her
alone
all
my
and
i
love
her
so
that
i
cannot
imagine
life
without
i
cannot
propose
to
her
at
but
the
thought
that
perhaps
she
might
someday
be
my
wife
and
that
i
may
be
missing
that
that
is
tell
can
i
tell
me
what
i
am
to
dear
he
added
after
a
and
touched
her
hand
as
she
did
not
am
thinking
of
what
you
have
told
answered
princess
is
what
i
will
you
are
right
that
to
speak
to
her
of
love
at
princess
mary
she
was
going
to
say
that
to
speak
of
love
was
but
she
stopped
because
she
had
seen
by
the
sudden
change
in
natasha
two
days
before
that
she
would
not
only
not
be
hurt
if
pierre
spoke
of
his
but
that
it
was
the
very
thing
she
wished
speak
to
her
now
said

sprung

a
frightened
expression

but
it
how
happy

pierre
kept
saying
as
he
kissed
princess
to
that
will
be
and
i
will
write
to
she
go
very
but
i
may
come
again
next
day
pierre
came
to
say
natasha
was
less
animated
than
she
had
been
the
day
but
that
day
as
he
looked
at
her
pierre
sometimes
felt
as
if
he
was
vanishing
and
that
neither
he
nor
she
existed
any
that
nothing
existed
but
it
it
he
told
himself
at
every
and
word
that
filled
his
soul
with
when
on
saying
he
took
her
slender
he
could
not
help
holding
it
a
little
longer
in
his
it
possible
that
this
that
those
all
this
treasure
of
feminine
charm
so
strange
to
me
is
it
possible
that
it
will
one
day
be
mine
as
familiar
to
me
as
i
am
to
she
said
shall
look
forward
very
much
to
your
she
added
in
a
and
these
simple
her
and
the
expression
on
her
face
which
accompanied
formed
for
two
months
the
subject
of
inexhaustible
and
happy
meditations
for
shall
look
forward
very
much
to
your
how
did
she
say
shall
look
forward
very
much
to
your
how
happy
i
what
is
happening
to
how
happy
i
said
pierre
to
chapter
xix
there
was
nothing
in
soul
now
at
all
like
what
had
troubled
it
during
his
courtship
of
he
did
not
repeat
to
himself
with
a
sickening
feeling
of
shame
the
words
he
had
or
why
did
i
not
say
made
me
say
vous
on
the
he
now
repeated
in
imagination
every
word
that
he
or
natasha
had
spoken
and
pictured
every
detail
of
her
face
and
and
did
not
wish
to
diminish
or
add
but
only
to
repeat
it
again
and
there
was
now
not
a
shadow
of
doubt
in
his
mind
as
to
whether
what
he
had
undertaken
was
right
or
only
one
terrible
doubt
sometimes
crossed
his
it
all
a
princess
mary
am
i
not
too
conceited
and
i
believe
all
suddenly
princess
mary
will
tell
and
she
will
be
sure
to
smile
and
he
must
be
deluding
he
know
that
he
is
a
just
a
while
i
am
something
altogether
different
and
that
was
the
only
doubt
often
troubling
he
did
not
now
make
any
the
happiness
before
him
appeared
so
inconceivable
that
if
only
he
could
attain
it
would
be
the
end
of
all
everything
ended
with
a
unexpected
of
which
he
had
thought
himself
possessed
the
whole
meaning
of
for
him
alone
but
for
the
whole
to
him
centered
in
his
love
and
the
possibility
of
being
loved
by
at
times
everybody
seemed
to
him
to
be
occupied
with
one
thing
future
sometimes
it
seemed
to
him
that
other
people
were
all
as
pleased
as
he
was
himself
and
merely
tried
to
hide
that
pleasure
by
pretending
to
be
busy
with
other
in
every
word
and
gesture
he
saw
allusions
to
his
he
often
surprised
those
he
met
by
his
significantly
happy
looks
and
smiles
which
seemed
to
express
a
secret
understanding
between
him
and
and
when
he
realized
that
people
might
not
be
aware
of
his
he
pitied
them
with
his
whole
heart
and
felt
a
desire
somehow
to
explain
to
them
that
all
that
occupied
them
was
a
mere
frivolous
trifle
unworthy
of
when
it
was
suggested
to
him
that
he
should
enter
the
civil
or
when
the
war
or
any
general
political
affairs
were
discussed
on
the
assumption
that
welfare
depended
on
this
or
that
issue
of
he
would
listen
with
a
mild
and
pitying
smile
and
surprise
people
by
his
strange
but
at
this
time
he
saw
those
as
he
understood
the
real
meaning
of
life
what
he
was
and
those
unfortunates
who
evidently
did
not
understand
the
bright
light
of
the
emotion
that
shone
within
and
at
once
without
any
effort
saw
in
everyone
he
met
everything
that
was
good
and
worthy
of
being
when
dealing
with
the
affairs
and
papers
of
his
dead
her
memory
aroused
in
him
no
feeling
but
pity
that
she
had
not
known
the
bliss
he
now
prince
who
having
obtained
a
new
post
and
some
fresh
decorations
was
particularly
proud
at
this
seemed
to
him
a
kindly
old
man
much
to
be
often
in
afterlife
pierre
recalled
this
period
of
blissful
all
the
views
he
formed
of
men
and
circumstances
at
this
time
remained
true
for
him
he
not
only
did
not
renounce
them
but
when
he
was
in
doubt
or
inwardly
at
he
referred
to
the
views
he
had
held
at
this
time
of
his
madness
and
they
always
proved
may
have
appeared
strange
and
queer
he
i
was
not
so
mad
as
i
on
the
contrary
i
was
then
wiser
and
had
more
insight
than
at
any
other
and
understood
all
that
is
worth
understanding
in
because
i
was
insanity
consisted
in
not
as
he
used
to
to
discover
personal
attributes
which
he
termed
in
people
before
loving
his
heart
was
now
overflowing
with
and
by
loving
people
without
cause
he
discovered
indubitable
causes
for
loving
chapter
xx
after
departure
that
first
when
natasha
had
said
to
princess
mary
with
a
gaily
mocking
looks
just
as
if
he
had
come
out
of
a
russian
a
short
coat
and
with
his
hair
something
hidden
and
unknown
to
but
awoke
in
her
and
was
suddenly
to
her
own
surprise
a
power
of
life
and
hope
of
happiness
rose
to
the
surface
and
demanded
from
that
evening
she
seemed
to
have
forgotten
all
that
had
happened
to
she
no
longer
complained
of
her
did
not
say
a
word
about
the
and
no
longer
feared
to
make
happy
plans
for
the
she
spoke
little
of
but
when
princess
mary
mentioned
him
a
light
once
more
kindled
in
her
eyes
and
her
lips
curved
with
a
strange
the
change
that
took
place
in
natasha
at
first
surprised
princess
but
when
she
understood
its
meaning
it
grieved
she
have
loved
my
brother
so
little
as
to
be
able
to
forget
him
so
she
thought
when
she
reflected
on
the
but
when
she
was
with
natasha
she
was
not
vexed
with
her
and
did
not
reproach
the
reawakened
power
of
life
that
had
seized
natasha
was
so
evidently
irrepressible
and
unexpected
by
her
that
in
her
presence
princess
mary
felt
that
she
had
no
right
to
reproach
her
even
in
her
natasha
gave
herself
up
so
fully
and
frankly
to
this
new
feeling
that
she
did
not
try
to
hide
the
fact
that
she
was
no
longer
but
bright
and
when
princess
mary
returned
to
her
room
after
her
nocturnal
talk
with
natasha
met
her
on
the
has
he
has
she
and
a
joyful
yet
pathetic
expression
which
seemed
to
beg
forgiveness
for
her
joy
settled
on
wanted
to
listen
at
the
but
i
knew
you
would
tell
understandable
and
touching
as
the
look
with
which
natasha
gazed
at
her
seemed
to
princess
and
sorry
as
she
was
to
see
her
these
words
pained
her
for
a
she
remembered
her
brother
and
his
to
be
she
help
thought
the
and
with
a
sad
and
rather
stern
look
she
told
natasha
all
that
pierre
had
on
hearing
that
he
was
going
to
petersburg
natasha
was
she
repeated
as
if
unable
to
but
noticing
the
grieved
expression
on
princess
face
she
guessed
the
reason
of
that
sadness
and
suddenly
began
to
said
me
what
i
should
i
am
afraid
of
being
whatever
you
tell
i
will
tell
love
whispered
why
are
you
i
am
happy
for
your
said
princess
who
because
of
those
tears
quite
forgave
be
just
think
what
fun
it
will
be
when
i
am
his
wife
and
you
marry
i
have
asked
you
not
to
speak
of

in

he
behaved
admirably
at
the

acted
badly
by
giving
a
constitution
to
forming

holy
entrusting
power
to
favoring
golitsyn
and
and
afterwards
shishkov
and
he
also
acted
badly
by
concerning
himself
with
the
active
army
and
disbanding
the
semenov
it
would
take
a
dozen
pages
to
enumerate
all
the
reproaches
the
historians
address
to
based
on
their
knowledge
of
what
is
good
for
what
do
these
reproaches
do
not
the
very
actions
for
which
the
historians
praise
alexander
i
liberal
attempts
at
the
beginning
of
his
his
struggle
with
the
firmness
he
displayed
in
1812
and
the
campaign
of
flow
from
the
same
circumstances
of
his
and
made
his
personality
what
it
was
and
from
which
the
actions
for
which
they
blame
him
holy
the
restoration
of
and
the
reaction
of
1820
and
also
in
what
does
the
substance
of
those
reproaches
it
lies
in
the
fact
that
an
historic
character
like
alexander
standing
on
the
highest
possible
pinnacle
of
human
power
with
the
blinding
light
of
history
focused
upon
a
character
exposed
to
those
strongest
of
all
the
and
inseparable
from
a
character
who
at
every
moment
of
his
life
felt
a
responsibility
for
all
that
was
happening
in
and
not
a
fictitious
but
a
live
character
who
like
every
man
had
his
personal
and
impulses
toward
and
this
not
lacking
in
virtue
historians
do
not
accuse
him
of
not
the
same
conception
of
the
welfare
of
humanity
fifty
years
ago
as
a
professor
who
from
his
youth
upwards
has
been
occupied
with
that
with
books
and
lectures
and
with
taking
notes
from
but
even
if
we
assume
that
fifty
years
ago
alexander
i
was
mistaken
in
his
view
of
what
was
good
for
the
we
must
inevitably
assume
that
the
historian
who
judges
alexander
will
also
after
the
lapse
of
some
time
turn
out
to
be
mistaken
in
his
view
of
what
is
good
for
this
assumption
is
all
the
more
natural
and
inevitable
watching
the
movement
of
we
see
that
every
year
and
with
each
new
opinion
as
to
what
is
good
for
mankind
so
that
what
once
seemed
ten
years
later
seems
and
vice
and
what
is
we
find
at
one
and
the
same
time
quite
contradictory
views
as
to
what
is
bad
and
what
is
good
in
some
people
regard
giving
a
constitution
to
poland
and
forming
the
holy
alliance
as
praiseworthy
in
while
others
regard
it
as
the
activity
of
alexander
or
of
napoleon
cannot
be
called
useful
or
for
it
is
impossible
to
say
for
what
it
was
useful
or
if
that
activity
displeases
this
is
only
because
it
does
not
agree
with
his
limited
understanding
of
what
is
whether
the
preservation
of
my
house
in
or
the
glory
of
the
russian
or
the
prosperity
of
the
petersburg
and
other
or
the
freedom
of
poland
or
the
greatness
of
or
the
balance
of
power
in
or
a
certain
kind
of
european
culture
called
appear
to
me
to
be
good
or
i
must
admit
that
besides
these
things
the
action
of
every
historic
character
has
other
more
general
purposes
inaccessible
to
but
let
us
assume
that
what
is
called
science
can
harmonize
all
contradictions
and
possesses
an
unchanging
standard
of
good
and
bad
by
which
to
try
historic
characters
and
let
us
say
that
alexander
could
have
done
everything
let
us
say
that
with
guidance
from
those
who
blame
him
and
who
profess
to
know
the
ultimate
aim

he
might
have
arranged
matters
according
to
the
program
his
present
accusers
would
have
given

cover
the
let
us
assume
that
this
program
was
possible
and
had
then
been
and
that
alexander
had
acted
on
what
would
then
have
become
of
the
activity
of
all
those
who
opposed
the
tendency
that
then
prevailed
in
the
activity

in
the
opinion
of
the
historians
was
good
and
their
activity
would
not
have

the

anything
it
is
impossible
to
explain
the
facts
of
history
without
introducing
the
conceptions
of
chance

if
the
aim
of
the
european
wars
at
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
had
been
the
aggrandizement
of
that
aim
might
have
been
accomplished
without

the

have
accomplished
that
much
better
than
if
the
aim
was
the
progress
of
it
is
easy
to
see
that
there
are
other
ways
of
diffusing
civilization
more
expedient
than
by
the
destruction

of
human
why

it

what

what

the
words
chance
and

do
not
denote
any
really

therefore
cannot
be
those

beyond

not

drives
each

feed

fat

must
seem
to
be
a

it
must
appear
an
astonishing
conjunction
of
genius
with
a
whole
series
of
extraordinary
chances
that
this
who
instead
of
getting
into
the
general
fold
every
evening
goes
into
a
special
enclosure

only
cease
to
suppose
that
all
that

to

happens

for
the
attainment
of
their
sheepish
they
need
only
admit
that
what

to
them
may
also
have
purposes
beyond

they
will
at

perceive
a

to
the

that
was

if
they
do
not

they

they
will
at

know
that
all
that
happened
to
the
ram
did
not
happen
and
will
no
longer
need
the
conceptions
of

or
only
by
renouncing
our
claim
to
discern
a

immediately
intelligible
to
and
admitting
the
ultimate

to
be
beyond

we
discern
the
sequence
of
experiences
in
the

of
historic
characters
and
perceive
the
cause
of
the
effect
they
produce
with
ordinary
human
and
then
the
words

and
genius
become
we
need
only
confess
that
we
do
not
know
the
purpose
of
the
european
convulsions
and
that
we
know
only
the
the
first
in
then
in
in
in
in
in
and
in
that
the
movements
from
the
west
to
the
east
and
from
the
east
to
the
west
form
the
essence
and
purpose
of
these
and
not
only
shall
we
have
no
need
to
see
exceptional
ability
and
genius
in
napoleon
and
but
we
shall
be
unable
to
consider
them
to
be
anything
but
like
other
and
we
shall
not
be
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
chance
for
an
explanation
of
those
small
events
which
made
these
people
what
they
but
it
will
be
clear
that
all
those
small
events
were
by
discarding
a
claim
to
knowledge
of
the
ultimate
we
shall
clearly
perceive
that
just
as
one
cannot
imagine
a
blossom
or
seed
for
any
single
plant
better
suited
to
it
than
those
it
so
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
any
two
people
more
completely
adapted
down
to
the
smallest
detail
for
the
purpose
they
had
to
than
napoleon
and
alexander

the
fundamental
and
essential
significance
of
the
european
events
of
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
lies
in
the
movement
of
the
mass
of
the
european
peoples
from
west
to
east
and
afterwards
from
east
to
the
commencement
of
that
movement
was
the
movement
from
west
to
for
the
peoples
of
the
west
to
be
able
to
make
their
warlike
movement
to
moscow
it
was
that
they
should
form
themselves
into
a
military
group
of
a
size
able
to
endure
a
collision
with
the
warlike
military
group
of
the
that
they
should
abandon
all
established
traditions
and
and
that
during
their
military
movement
they
should
have
at
their
head
a
man
who
could
justify
to
himself
and
to
them
the
and
murders
which
would
have
to
be
committed
during
that
and
beginning
with
the
french
revolution
the
old
inadequately
large
group
was
as
well
as
the
old
habits
and
and
step
by
step
a
group
was
formed
of
larger
dimensions
with
new
customs
and
and
a
man
was
produced
who
would
stand
at
the
head
of
the
coming
movement
and
bear
the
responsibility
for
all
that
had
to
be
a
man
without
without
without
without
a
and
not
even
a
what
seem
the
strangest
among
all
the
seething
french

without

of
them

borne
forward
to
a

ignorance
of

this
man

him
to

times

he
finds
the

in
paris
in
a
process
of
dissolution
in
which
all
those
who
are
in
it
are
inevitably
wiped
out
and
and
by
chance
an
escape
from
this
dangerous
position
presents
itself
in
the

which
subsequently

allows
his
entire
army
to
elude
in

a
whole
series
of
outrages
are
committed
against
the
almost
unarmed
and
the
men
who
commit
these
especially
their
assure
themselves
that
this
is
this
is
resembles
caesar
and
alexander
the
great
and
is
therefore
this
ideal
of
glory
and
consists
not
merely
in
considering
nothing
wrong
that
one
does
but
in
priding
oneself
on
every
crime
one
ascribing
to
it
an
incomprehensible
supernatural
destined
to
guide

man

the

he
has
committed
so
he
reaches
the
dissolution
of
the
republican
which
a
year
earlier
might
have
ruined
has
reached
its
extreme
and
his
presence
there
now
as
a
newcomer
free
from
party
entanglements
can
only
serve
to
exalt
though
he
himself
has
no
he
is
quite
ready
for
his
new
he
had
no
he
was
afraid
of
but
the
parties
snatched
at
him
and
demanded
his
he
his
ideal
of
glory
and
grandeur
developed
in
italy
and
his
insane
his
boldness
in
crime
and
frankness
in
alone
could
justify
what
had
to
be
he
is
needed
for
the
place
that
awaits
and
so
almost
apart
from
his
will
and
despite
his
his
lack
of
a
and
all
his
he
is
drawn
into
a
conspiracy
that
aims
at
seizing
power
and
the
conspiracy
is
crowned
with
he
is
pushed
into
a
meeting
of
the
in
alarm
he
wishes
to
considering
himself
he
pretends
to
fall
into
a
swoon
and
says
senseless
things
that
should
have
ruined
but
the
once
proud
and
shrewd
rulers
of
feeling
that
their
part
is
played
are
even
more
bewildered
than
and
do
not
say
the
words
they
should
have
said
to
destroy
him
and
retain
their
millions
of

all

of

who
recognizes
his
chance
contrives
a
plot
against
him
which
not
only
fails
to
harm
him
but
confirms
his
chance
puts
the
duc
in
his
hands
and
unexpectedly
causes
him
to
kill
convincing
the
mob
more
forcibly
than
in
any
other
way
that
he

never

out
that

unexpectedly
falls
upon

the
who

him
the

by

toward
the
east
several
times
in

in

of

that
had
formed
in

unites
into

the
peoples
of

the
strength
of
the
justification

the

of
the
discredited

oppose
no

ideal
to
the
insensate
napoleonic
ideal

in

died
that

year
as
always
after
the
death
the
family
group
broke
the
events
of
the
previous
the
burning
of
moscow
and
the
flight
from

the
old
grief
fell

on
the
old

seemed
to
be
unable
to
understand
the
meaning
of
all
these
and
bowed
his
old
head
in
a
spiritual
sense
as
if
expecting
and
inviting
further
blows
which
would
finish

seemed
now
frightened
and
distraught
and
now
unnaturally
animated
and
the
arrangements
for
marriage
occupied
him
for
a

ordered
dinners
and
suppers
and
obviously
tried
to
appear
but
his
cheerfulness
was
not
infectious
as
it
used
to
on
the
contrary
it
evoked
the
compassion
of
those
who
knew

liked

pierre
and
his

grew
very
quiet
and
began
to
complain
of

few
days
later
he
fell
ill
and
took

realized
from
the
first
that
he
would
not
get
up
despite
the
the
countess
passed
a
fortnight
in
an
armchair
by
his
pillow
without
every
time
she
gave
him
his
medicine
he
sobbed
and
silently
kissed
her
on
his
last

asked
her
and
his
absent
son
to
forgive
him
for
having
dissipated
their
being
the
chief
fault
of
which
he
was
after
receiving
communion
and
unction
he
quietly
and
next
day
a
throng
of
acquaintances
who
came
to
pay
their
last
respects
to
the
deceased
filled
the
house
rented
by
the
all
these
who
had
so
often
dined
and
danced
at
his
house
and
had
so
often
laughed
at
now
with
a
common
feeling
of
and
as
if
justifying
whatever
he
may
have
been
he
was
a
most
worthy
you
meet
such
men
and
which
of
us
has
not
weaknesses
of
his
it
was
just
when
the
affairs
had
become
so
involved
that
it
was
impossible
to
say
what
would
happen
if
he
lived
another
year
that
he
unexpectedly
nicholas
was
with
the
russian
army
in
paris
when
the
news
of
his
death
reached
he
at
once
resigned
his
and
without
waiting
for
it
to
be
accepted
took
leave
of
absence
and
went
to
the
state
of
the
affairs
became
quite
obvious
a
month
after
his
surprising
everyone
by
the
immense
total
of
small
debts
the
existence
of
which
no
one
had
the
debts
amounted
to
double
the
value
of
the
friends
and
relations
advised
nicholas
to
decline
the
but
he
regarded
such
a
refusal
as
a
slur
on
his
which
he
held
and
therefore
would
not
hear
of
refusing
and
accepted
the
inheritance
together
with
the
obligation
to
pay
the
the
creditors
who
had
so
long
been
restrained
by
a
vague
but
powerful
influence
exerted
on
them
while
he
lived
by
the
careless
good
all
proceeded
to
enforce
their
claims
at
as
always
happens
in
such
cases
rivalry
sprang
up
as
to
which
should
get
paid
and
those
who
like
mitenka
held
promissory
notes
given
them
as
presents
now
became
the
most
exacting
of
the
nicholas
was
allowed
no
respite
and
no
and
those
who
had
seemed
to
pity
the
old
cause
of
their
losses
they
were
remorselessly
pursued
the
young
heir
who
had
voluntarily
undertaken
the
debts
and
was
obviously
not
guilty
of
contracting
not
one
of
the
plans
nicholas
tried
the
estate
was
sold
by
auction
for
half
its
and
half
the
debts
still
remained
nicholas
accepted
thirty
thousand
rubles
offered
him
by
his
law
bezukhov
to
pay
off
debts
he
regarded
as
genuinely
due
for
value
and
to
avoid
being
imprisoned
for
the
as
the
creditors
he
the
government
he
could
not
rejoin
the
army
where
he
would
have
been
made
colonel
at
the
next
for
his
mother
now
clung
to
him
as
her
one
hold
on
and
so
despite
his
reluctance
to
remain
in
moscow
among
people
who
had
known
him
and
despite
his
abhorrence
of
the
civil
he
accepted
a
post
in
moscow
in
that
doffed
the
uniform
of
which
he
was
so
and
moved
with
his
mother
and
sonya
to
a
small
house
on
the
sivtsev
natasha
and
pierre
were
living
in
petersburg
at
the
time
and
had
no
clear
idea
of
having
borrowed
money
from
his
nicholas
tried
to
hide
his
wretched
condition
from
his
position
was
the
more
difficult
because
with
his
salary
of
twelve
hundred
rubles
he
had
not
only
to
keep
his
and
but
had
to
shield
his
mother
from
knowledge
of
their
the
countess
could
not
conceive
of
life
without
the
luxurious
conditions
she
had
been
used
to
from
childhood
unable
to
realize
how
hard
it
was
for
her
kept
demanding
now
a
carriage
they
did
not
to
send
for
a
now
some
expensive
article
of
food
for
or
wine
for
her
or
money
to
buy
a
present
as
a
surprise
for
natasha
or
or
for
nicholas
sonya
kept
attended
on
her
read
to
put
up
with
her
whims
and
secret
and
helped
nicholas
to
conceal
their
poverty
from
the
old
nicholas
felt
himself
irredeemably
indebted
to
sonya
for
all
she
was
doing
for
his
mother
and
greatly
admired
her
patience
and
but
tried
to
keep
aloof
from
he
seemed
in
his
heart
to
reproach
her
for
being
too
and
because
there
was
nothing
to
reproach
her
she
had
all
that
people
are
valued
but
little
that
could
have
made
him
love
he
felt
that
the
more
he
valued
her
the
less
he
loved
he
had
taken
her
at
her
word
when
she
wrote
giving
him
his
freedom
and
now
behaved
as
if
all
that
had
passed
between
them
had
been
long
forgotten
and
could
never
in
any
case
be
position
became
worse
and
the
idea
of
putting
something
aside
out
of
his
salary
proved
a
not
only
did
he
not
save
but
to
comply
with
his
demands
he
even
incurred
some
small
he
could
see
no
way
out
of
this
the
idea
of
marrying
some
rich
which
was
suggested
to
him
by
his
female
was
repugnant
to
the
other
way
never
entered
his
he
wished
for
nothing
and
hoped
for
and
deep
in
his
heart
experienced
a
gloomy
and
stern
satisfaction
in
an
uncomplaining
endurance
of
his
he
tried
to
avoid
his
old
acquaintances
with
their
commiseration
and
offensive
offers
of
he
avoided
all
distraction
and
and
even
at
home
did
nothing
but
play
cards
with
his
pace
silently
up
and
down
the
and
smoke
one
pipe
after
he
seemed
carefully
to
cherish
within
himself
the
gloomy
mood
which
alone
enabled
him
to
endure
his
chapter
vi
at
the
beginning
of
winter
princess
mary
came
to
from
reports
current
in
town
she
learned
how
the
rostovs
were
and
how
son
has
sacrificed
himself
for
his
as
people
were
never
expected
anything
else
of
said
princess
mary
to
feeling
a
joyous
sense
of
her
love
for
remembering
her
friendly
relations
with
all
the
rostovs
which
had
made
her
almost
a
member
of
the
she
thought
it
her
duty
to
go
to
see
but
remembering
her
relations
with
nicholas
in
voronezh
she
was
shy
about
doing
making
a
great
effort
she
did
however
go
to
call
on
them
a
few
weeks
after
her
arrival
in
nicholas
was
the
first
to
meet
as
the
room
could
only
be
reached
through
but
instead
of
being
greeted
with
pleasure
as
she
had
at
his
first
glance
at
her
his
face
assumed
a
proud
expression
she
had
not
seen
on
it
he
inquired
about
her

the
way
to
his
and
having
sat
there
for
five
minutes
left
the
when
the
princess
came
out
of
the
room
nicholas
met
her
and
with
marked
solemnity
and
stiffness
accompanied
her
to
the
to
her
remarks
about
his
health
he
made
no
that
to
leave
me
in
his
looks
seemed
to
does
she
come
prowling
what
does
she
i
bear
these
ladies
and
all
these
said
he
aloud
in
evidently
unable
to
repress
his

the
carriage

how
can
you
talk
like
cried
hardly
able
to
conceal
her
is
so
kind
and
mamma
is
so
fond
of
nicholas
did
not
reply
and
tried
to
avoid
speaking
of
the
princess
any
but
after
her
visit
the
old
countess
spoke
of
her
several
times
a
she
sang
her
insisted
that
her
son
must
call
on
expressed
a
wish
to
see
her
but
yet
always
became
when
she
began
to
talk
about
nicholas
tried
to
keep
silence
when
his
mother
spoke
of
the

his
silence
irritated

a
very
admirable
and
excellent
young

i
think
it
must
be
dull
for
you

in
the
least

and
now
you
really
i
understand
my
one
day

the
next
you
refuse

never

is
a
very
admirable
young

you
always
liked

now
suddenly
you
have
got
some
notion
or
other
in
your
you
hide
everything
from

i
were
asking
you
to
do
something
disagreeable
i
only
ask
you
to

now
i

more

only

for

nicholas
bit
his
and
laid
out
the
cards
for
a
trying
to
divert
his
attention
to
another
the
same
conversation
was
repeated
next
day
and
the
day
and
the
day
after
after
her
visit
to
the
rostovs
and
her
unexpectedly
chilly
reception
by
princess
mary
confessed
to
herself
that
she
had
been
right
in
not
wishing
to
be
the
first
to
expected
nothing
she
told
calling
her
pride
to
her
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
and
i
only
wanted
to
see
the
old
who
was
always
kind
to
me
and
to
whom
i
am
under
many
but
she
could
not
pacify
herself
with
these
a
feeling
akin
to
remorse
troubled
her
when
she
thought
of
her
though
she
had
firmly
resolved
not
to
call
on
the
rostovs
again
and
to
forget
the
whole
she
felt
herself
all
the
time
in
an
awkward
and
when
she
asked
herself
what
distressed
she
had
to
admit
that
it
was
her
relation
to
his
polite
manner
did
not
express
his
feeling
for
her
knew
but
it
concealed
and
until
she
could
discover
what
that
something
she
felt
that
she
could
not
be
at
one
day
in
midwinter
when
sitting
in
the
schoolroom
attending
to
her
she
was
informed
that
rostov
had
with
a
firm
resolution
not
to
betray
herself
and
not
show
her
she
sent
for
mademoiselle
bourienne
and
went
with
her
to
the
drawing
her
first
glance
at
face
told
her
that
he
had
only
come
to
fulfill
the
demands
of
and
she
firmly
resolved
to
maintain
the
tone
in
which
he
addressed
they
spoke
of
the
of
their
mutual
of
the
latest
war
and
when
the
ten
minutes
required
by
propriety
had
elapsed
after
which
a
visitor
may
nicholas
got
up
to
say
with
mademoiselle
help
the
princess
had
maintained
the
conversation
very
but
at
the
very
last
just
when
he
she
was
so
tired
of
talking
of
what
did
not
interest
and
her
mind
was
so
full
of
the
question
why
she
alone
was
granted
so
little
happiness
in
that
in
a
fit
of
she
sat
her
luminous
eyes
gazing
fixedly
before
not
noticing
that
he
had
nicholas
glanced
at
her
wishing
to
appear
not
to
notice
her
made
some
remark
to
mademoiselle
bourienne
and
then
again
looked
at
the
she
still
sat
motionless
with
a
look
of
suffering
on
her
gentle
he
suddenly
felt
sorry
for
her
and
was
vaguely
conscious
that
he
might
be
the
cause
of
the
sadness
her
face
he
wished
to
help
her
and
say
something
but
could
think
of
nothing
to
said
she
and
sighed
i
beg
your

if

well
but
the

for

mademoiselle
and
she
left
the

both
sat
with
an
occasional
glance
at
one
said
nicholas
at
last
with
a
sad
seem
long
ago
since
we
first
met
at
but
how
much
water
has
flowed
since
in
what
distress
we
all
seemed
to
be
yet
i
would
give
much
to
bring
back
that
but
no
bringing

princess
mary
gazed
intently
into
his
eyes
with
her
own
luminous
ones
as
he
said
she
seemed
to
be
trying
to
fathom
the
hidden
meaning
of
his
words
which
would
explain
his
feeling
for
said
you
have
no
reason
to
regret
the
as
i
understand
your
present
i
think
you
will
always
recall
it
with
because
the
that
fills
it
cannot
accept
your

interrupted
her
the
contrary
i
continually
reproach
but
this
is
not
at
all
an
interesting
or
cheerful
his
face
again
resumed
its
former
stiff
and
cold
but
the
princess
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
man
she
had
known
and
and
it
was
to
him
that
she
now
thought
you
would
allow
me
to
tell
you
she
had
come
so
near
to
and
to
all
your
family
that
i
thought
you
would
not
consider
my
sympathy
but
i
was
and
suddenly
her
voice

she
recovering

used
to
be

a
thousand
reasons
laying
special
emphasis
on
the

added

whispered
in

was
not

that
and
frank
not

that
handsome

spirit
she
said
to
he
is
poor
now
and
i
am

not
for
and
remembering
his
former
and
looking
now
at
his
sorrowful
she
suddenly
understood
the
cause
of
his
she
almost
unconsciously
moving
closer
to
tell
you
must
tell
he

your

confess
for
some
reason
you
wish
to
deprive
me
of

that

were

in
her
eyes
and
in
her
have
had
so
little
happiness
in
life
that
every
loss
is
hard
for
me
to
excuse
and
suddenly
she
began
to
cry
and
was
hurrying
from
the
for

trying
to
stop

turned
for
a
few
seconds

gazed
silently
into

seemed
impossible

chapter
vii
in
the
winter
of
1813
nicholas
married
princess
mary
and
moved
to
bald
hills
with
his
his
and
within
four
years
he
had
paid
off
all
his
remaining
debts
without
selling
any
of
his
and
having
received
a
small
inheritance
on
the
death
of
a
cousin
he
paid
his
debt
to
pierre
as
in
another
three
by
he
had
so
managed
his
affairs
that
he
was
able
to
buy
a
small
estate
adjoining
bald
hills
and
was
negotiating
to
buy
back
being
his
pet
having
started
farming
from
he
soon
grew
so
devoted
to
it
that
it
became
his
favorite
and
almost
his
sole
nicholas
was
a
plain
he
did
not
like
especially
the
english
ones
then
coming
into
he
laughed
at
theoretical
treatises
on
estate
disliked
the
raising
of
expensive
and
the
buying
of
expensive
seed
and
did
not
make
a
hobby
of
any
particular
part
of
the
work
on
his
he
always
had
before
his
eye
the
estate
as
a
whole
and
not
any
particular
part
of
the
chief
thing
in
his
eyes
was
not
the
nitrogen
in
the
nor
the
oxygen
in
the
nor
nor
special
but
that
most
important
agent
by
which
and
plow
were
made
the
peasant
when
nicholas
first
began
farming
and
began
to
understand
its
different
it
was
the
serf
who
especially
attracted
his
the
peasant
seemed
to
him
not
merely
a
but
also
a
judge
of
farming
and
an
end
in
at
first
he
watched
the
trying
to
understand
their
aims
and
what
they
considered
good
and
and
only
pretended
to
direct
them
and
give
orders
while
in
reality
learning
from
them
their
their
manner
of
and
their
judgment
of
what
was
good
and
only
when
he
had
understood
the
tastes
and
had
learned
to
talk
their
to
grasp
the
hidden
meaning
of
their
and
felt
akin
to
them
did
he
begin
boldly
to
manage
his
that
to
perform
toward
them
the
duties
demanded
of
and
management
produced
very
brilliant
guided
by
some
gift
of
on
taking
up
the
management
of
the
estates
he
at
once
unerringly
appointed
as
village
and
the
very
men
the
serfs
would
themselves
have
chosen
had
they
had
the
right
to
and
these
posts
never
changed
before
analyzing
the
properties
of
before
entering
into
the
debit
and
credit
he
ironically
called
he
found
out
how
many
cattle
the
peasants
had
and
increased
the
number
by
all
possible
he
kept
the
peasant
families
together
in
the
largest
groups
not
allowing
the
family
groups
to
divide
into
separate
he
was
hard
alike
on
the
the
and
the
and
tried
to
get
them
expelled
from
the
he
was
as
careful
of
the
sowing
and
reaping
of
the
hay
and
corn
as
of
his
and
few
landowners
had
their
crops
sown
and
harvested
so
early
and
so
or
got
so
good
a
as
did
he
disliked
having
anything
to
do
with
the
domestic
as
he
called
everyone
said
he
spoiled
them
by
his
when
a
decision
had
to
be
taken
regarding
a
domestic
especially
if
one
had
to
be
he
always
felt
undecided
and
consulted
everybody
in
the
but
when
it
was
possible
to
have
a
domestic
serf
conscripted
instead
of
a
land
worker
he
did
so
without
the
least
he
never
felt
any
hesitation
in
dealing
with
the
he
knew
that
his
every
decision
would
be
approved
by
them
all
with
very
few
he
did
not
allow
himself
either
to
be
hard
on
or
punish
a
or
to
make
things
easy
for
or
reward
merely
because
he
felt
inclined
to
do
he
could
not
have
said
by
what
standard
he
judged
what
he
should
or
should
not
but
the
standard
was
quite
firm
and
definite
in
his
own
speaking
with
vexation
of
some
failure
or
he
would
can
one
do
with
our
russian
and
imagined
that
he
could
not
bear
yet
he
loved
russian
and
their
way
of
life
with
his
whole
and
for
that
very
reason
had
understood
and
assimilated
the
one
way
and
manner
of
farming
which
produced
good
countess
mary
was
jealous
of
this
passion
of
her
and
regretted
that
she
could
not
share
but
she
could
not
understand
the
joys
and
vexations
he
derived
from
that
to
her
so
remote
and
she
could
not
understand
why
he
was
so
particularly
animated
and
happy
after
getting
up
at
daybreak
and
spending
the
whole
morning
in
the
fields
or
on
the
threshing
he
returned
from
the
sowing
or
mowing
or
reaping
to
have
tea
with
she
did
not
understand
why
he
spoke
with
such
admiration
and
delight
of
the
farming
of
the
thrifty
and
peasant
matthew
who
with
his
family
had
carted
corn
all
or
of
the
fact
that
his
sheaves
were
already
stacked
before
anyone
else
had
his
harvest
she
did
not
understand
why
he
stepped
out
from
the
window
to
the
veranda
and
smiled
under
his
mustache
and
winked
so
when
warm
steady
rain
began
to
fall
on
the
dry
and
thirsty
shoots
of
the
young
or
why
when
the
wind
carried
away
a
threatening
cloud
during
the
hay
harvest
he
would
return
from
the
and
with
a
smell
of
wormwood
and
gentian
in
his
hair
gleefully
rubbing
his
would
one
more
day
and
my
grain
and
the
will
all
be
under
still
less
did
she
understand
why
kindhearted
and
always
ready
to
anticipate
her
should
become
almost
desperate
when
she
brought
him
a
petition
from
some
peasant
men
or
women
who
had
appealed
to
her
to
be
excused
some
why
that
kind
should
obstinately
refuse
angrily
asking
her
not
to
interfere
in
what
was
not
her
she
felt
he
had
a
world
which
he
loved
passionately
and
which
had
laws
she
had
not
sometimes
trying
to
understand
she
spoke
of
the
good
work
he
was
doing
for
his
he
would
be
vexed
and
in
the
it
never
entered
my
head
and
i
do
that
for
their
all
poetry
and
old
that
doing
good
to
what
i
want
is
that
our
children
should
not
have
to
go
i
must
put
our
affairs
in
order
while
i
am
and
to
do
order
and
strictness
are
all
about
said
clenching
his
vigorous
of
he
if
the
peasant
is
naked
and
hungry
and
has
only
one
miserable
he
can
do
no
good
either
for
himself
or
for
and
all
nicholas
did
was
just
because
he
refused
to
allow
himself
to
think
that
he
was
doing
good
to
others
for
his
means
increased
serfs
from
neighboring
estates
came
to
beg
him
to
buy
and
long
after
his
death
the
memory
of
his
administration
was
devoutly
preserved
among
the
was
a
the
affairs
first
and
then
his
of
course
he
was
not
to
be
trifled
with
a
he
was
a
real
chapter
viii
one
matter
connected
with
his
management
sometimes
worried
and
that
was
his
quick
temper
together
with
his
old
hussar
habit
of
making
free
use
of
his
at
first
he
saw
nothing
reprehensible
in
but
in
the
second
year
of
his
marriage
his
view
of
that
form
of
punishment
suddenly
once
in
summer
he
had
sent
for
the
village
elder
from
a
man
who
had
succeeded
to
the
post
when
dron
died
and
who
was
accused
of
dishonesty
and
various
nicholas
went
out
into
the
porch
to
question
and
immediately
after
the
elder
had
given
a
few
replies
the
sound
of
cries
and
blows
were
on
returning
to
lunch
nicholas
went
up
to
his
who
sat
with
her
head
bent
low
over
her
embroidery
and
as
usual
began
to
tell
her
what
he
had
been
doing
that
among
other
things
he
spoke
of
the
bogucharovo
countess
mary
turned
red
and
then
but
continued
to
sit
with
head
bowed
and
lips
compressed
and
gave
her
husband
no
an
insolent
he
growing
hot
again
at
the
mere
recollection
of
he
had
told
me
he
was
drunk
and
did
not
but
what
is
the
matter
with
he
suddenly
countess
mary
raised
her
head
and
tried
to
but
hastily
looked
down
again
and
her
lips
whatever
is
the
my
the
looks
of
the
plain
countess
mary
always
improved
when
she
was
in
she
never
cried
from
pain
or
but
always
from
sorrow
or
and
when
she
wept
her
radiant
eyes
acquired
an
irresistible
the
moment
nicholas
took
her
hand
she
could
no
longer
restrain
herself
and
began
to
i
saw
he
was
to
but
why
do
and
she
covered
her
face
with
her
nicholas
said
he
flushed
left
her
and
paced
up
and
down
the
he
understood
what
she
was
weeping
but
could
not
in
his
heart
at
once
agree
with
her
that
what
he
had
regarded
from
childhood
as
quite
an
everyday
event
was
it
just
old
or
is
she
he
asked
before
he
had
solved
that
point
he
glanced
again
at
her
face
filled
with
love
and
and
he
suddenly
realized
that
she
was
right
and
that
he
had
long
been
sinning
against
he
said
going
up
to
will
never
happen
i
give
you
my
he
repeated
in
a
trembling
voice
like
a
boy
asking
for
the
tears
flowed
faster
still
from
the
she
took
his
hand
and
kissed
when
did
you
break
your
she
asked
to
change
the
looking
at
his
finger
on
which
he
wore
a
ring
with
a
cameo
of
was
the
same
remind
me
of
and
again
he
give
you
my
word
of
honor
it
occur
and
let
this
always
be
a
reminder
to
and
he
pointed
to
the
broken
after
when
in
discussions
with
his
village
elders
or
stewards
the
blood
rushed
to
his
face
and
his
fists
began
to
nicholas
would
turn
the
broken
ring
on
his
finger
and
would
drop
his
eyes
before
the
man
who
was
making
him
but
he
did
forget
himself
once
or
twice
within
a
and
then
he
would
go
and
confess
to
his
and
would
again
promise
that
this
should
really
be
the
very
last
you
must
despise
he
would
deserve
should
go
away
at
if
you
feel
strong
enough
to
control
she
would
reply
trying
to
comfort
her
among
the
gentry
of
the
province
nicholas
was
respected
but
not
he
did
not
concern
himself
with
the
interests
of
his
own
and
consequently
some
thought
him
proud
and
others
thought
him
the
whole
from
spring
sowing
to
he
was
busy
with
the
work
on
his
in
autumn
he
gave
himself
up
to
hunting
with
the
same
home
for
a
or
even
with
his
in
winter
he
visited
his
other
villages
or
spent
his
time
the
books
he
read
were
chiefly
and
on
these
he
spent
a
certain
sum
every
he
was
as
he
a
serious
and
he
made
it
a
rule
to
read
through
all
the
books
he
he
would
sit
in
his
study
with
a
grave
task
he
first
imposed
upon
himself
as
a
but
which
afterwards
became
a
habit
affording
him
a
special
kind
of
pleasure
and
a
consciousness
of
being
occupied
with
serious
in
except
for
business
he
spent
most
of
his
time
at
home
making
himself
one
with
his
family
and
entering
into
all
the
details
of
his
relations
with
their
the
harmony
between
him
and
his
wife
grew
closer
and
closer
and
he
daily
discovered
fresh
spiritual
treasures
in
from
the
time
of
his
marriage
sonya
had
lived
in
his
before
nicholas
had
told
his
wife
all
that
had
passed
between
himself
and
blaming
himself
and
commending
he
had
asked
princess
mary
to
be
gentle
and
kind
to
his
she
thoroughly
realized
the
wrong
he
had
done
felt
herself
to
blame
toward
and
imagined
that
her
wealth
had
influenced
she
could
not
find
fault
with
sonya
in
any
way
and
tried
to
be
fond
of
but
often
felt
toward
her
which
she
could
not
once
she
had
a
talk
with
her
friend
natasha
about
sonya
and
about
her
own
injustice
toward
said
have
read
the
gospels
a
great
is
a
passage
in
them
that
just
fits
asked
countess
him
that
hath
shall
be
and
from
him
that
hath
not
shall
be
taken
you
she
is
one
that
hath
i
perhaps
she
lacks
i
but
from
her
is
taken
and
everything
has
been
taken
sometimes
i
am
dreadfully
sorry
for
formerly
i
very
much
wanted
nicholas
to
marry
but
i
always
had
a
sort
of
presentiment
that
it
would
not
come
she
is
a
sterile
you
some
strawberry
sometimes
i
am
sorry
for
and
sometimes
i
think
she
feel
it
as
you
or
i
though
countess
mary
told
natasha
that
those
words
in
the
gospel
must
be
understood
yet
looking
at
sonya
she
agreed
with
it
really
seemed
that
sonya
did
not
feel
her
position
and
had
grown
quite
reconciled
to
her
lot
as
a
sterile
she
seemed
to
be
fond
not
so
much
of
individuals
as
of
the
family
as
a
like
a
she
had
attached
herself
not
to
the
people
but
to
the

on
the
old
petted
and
spoiled

always
ready
to
render
the
small
services
for
which
she
had
a

all
this
was
unconsciously
accepted
from
her
with
insufficient

not

with

and
its

provided

was
the
eve
of
the
fifth
of
natasha

been
staying
at
her
with
her
husband
and
children
since
early
pierre
had
gone
to
petersburg
on
business
of
his
own
for
three
weeks
as
he
but
had
remained
there
nearly
seven
weeks
and
was
expected
back
every
besides
the
bezukhov
old
friend
the
retired
general
vasili
dmitrich
denisov
was
staying
with
the
rostovs
this
fifth
of
on
the
which
was
his
name
day
when
the
house
would
be
full
of
nicholas
knew
he
would
have
to
exchange
his
tartar
tunic
for
a
tail
and
put
on
narrow
boots
with
pointed
and
drive
to
the
new
church
he
had
and
then
receive
visitors
who
would
come
to
congratulate
offer
them
and
talk
about
the
elections
of
the
but
he
considered
himself
entitled
to
spend
the
eve
of
that
day
in
his
usual
he
examined
the
accounts
of
the
village
in
ryazan
which
belonged
to
his
wrote
two
business
and
walked
over
to
the
cattle
yards
and
stables
before
having
taken
precautions
against
the
general
drunkenness
to
be
expected
on
the
morrow
because
it
was
a
great
he
returned
to
and
without
having
time
for
a
private
talk
with
his
wife
sat
down
at
the
long
table
laid
for
twenty
at
which
the
whole
household
had
at
that
table
were
his
his
old
lady
companion
his
their
three
children
with
their
governess
and
his
nephew
with
his
her
three
their
and
old
michael
the
late
who
was
living
on
in
retirement
at
bald
countess
mary
sat
at
the
other
end
of
the
when
her
husband
took
his
place
she
from
the
rapid
manner
in
which
after
taking
up
his
table
napkin
he
pushed
back
the
tumbler
and
wineglass
standing
before
that
he
was
out
of
as
was
sometimes
the
case
when
he
came
in
to
dinner
straight
from
the
before
the
countess
mary
well
knew
that
mood
of
and
when
she
herself
was
in
a
good
frame
of
mind
quietly
waited
till
he
had
had
his
soup
and
then
began
to
talk
to
him
and
make
him
admit
that
there
was
no
cause
for
his
but
today
she
quite
forgot
that
and
was
hurt
that
he
should
be
angry
with
her
without
any
and
she
felt
she
asked
him
where
he
had
he
she
again
inquired
whether
everything
was
going
well
on
the
her
unnatural
tone
made
him
wince
unpleasantly
and
he
replied
not
thought
countess
is
he
cross
with
she
concluded
from
his
tone
that
he
was
vexed
with
her
and
wished
to
end
the
she
knew
her
remarks
sounded
but
could
not
refrain
from
asking
some
more
thanks
to
denisov
the
conversation
at
table
soon
became
general
and
and
she
did
not
talk
to
her
when
they
left
the
table
and
went
as
usual
to
thank
the
old
countess
mary
held
out
her
hand
and
kissed
her
and
asked
him
why
he
was
angry
with
always
have
such
strange
i
even
think
of
being
he
but
the
word
always
seemed
to
her
to
i
am
angry
but
i
tell
you
nicholas
and
his
wife
lived
together
so
happily
that
even
sonya
and
the
old
who
felt
jealous
and
would
have
liked
them
to
could
find
nothing
to
reproach
them
but
even
they
had
their
moments
of
and
it
was
always
just
after
they
had
been
happiest
they
suddenly
had
a
feeling
of
estrangement
and
which
occurred
most
frequently
during
countess
and
this
was
such
a
messieurs
et
said
nicholas
loudly
and
with
apparent
cheerfulness
seemed
to
countess
mary
that
he
did
it
on
purpose
to
vex
have
been
on
my
feet
since
six
this
tomorrow
i
shall
have
to
so
today
go
and
and
without
a
word
to
his
wife
he
went
to
the
little
sitting
room
and
lay
down
on
the
always
the
thought
countess
talks
to
everyone
except
i
i
see
that
i
am
repulsive
to
especially
when
i
am
in
this
she
looked
down
at
her
expanded
figure
and
in

found
for

smiling
and
getting
and
smoothing
his

he
began
to
pace
the

been
he
immediately
thinking
aloud
in
his
presence
now
that
they
had
made
it
he
did
not
ask
if
she
was
ready
to
listen
to
he
did
not
a
thought
had
occurred
to
him
and
so
it
belonged
to
her
and
he
told
her
of
his
intention
to
persuade
pierre
to
stay
with
them
till
countess
mary
listened
till
he
had
made
some
and
in
her
turn
began
thinking
her
thoughts
were
about
the
can
see
the
woman
in
her
she
said
in
pointing
to
little
reproach

women
with

she
and
she
was
said
countess
mary
with
a
happy
and
taking
his
little
daughter
in
his
strong
lifted
her
placed
her
on
his
held
her
by
the
and
paced
the
room
with
there
was
an
expression
of
carefree
happiness
on
the
faces
of
both
father
and
you
know
you
may
be
you
are
too
fond
of
this
his
wife
whispered
in
but
what
am
i
to
i
try
not
to
at
that
moment
they
heard
the
sound
of
the
door
pulley
and
footsteps
in
the
hall
and
as
if
someone
had
has
am
sure
it
is
i
will
go
and
said
countess
mary
and
left
the
in
her
absence
nicholas
allowed
himself
to
give
his
little
daughter
a
gallop
round
the
out
of
he
took
the
laughing
child
quickly
from
his
shoulder
and
pressed
her
to
his
his
capers
reminded
him
of
and
looking
at
the
round
happy
little
face
he
thought
of
what
she
would
be
like
when
he
was
an
old
taking
her
into
society
and
dancing
the
mazurka
with
her
as
his
old
father
had
danced
daniel
cooper
with
his
is
it
is
said
countess
the
room
a
few
minutes
our
natasha
has
come
to
you
should
have
seen
her
and
how
he
caught
it
for
having
stayed
away
so
come
along
time
you
two
were
she
looking
smilingly
at
the
little
girl
who
clung
to
her
nicholas
went
out
holding
the
child
by
the
countess
mary
remained
in
the
sitting
should
never
have
believed
that
one
could
be
so
she
whispered
to
a
smile
lit
up
her
face
but
at
the
same
time
she
and
her
deep
eyes
expressed
a
quiet
sadness
as
though
she
through
her
that
there
is
another
sort
of
happiness
unattainable
in
this
life
and
of
which
she
involuntarily
thought
at
that
chapter
x
natasha
had
married
in
the
early
spring
of
and
in
1820
already
had
three
daughters
besides
a
son
for
whom
she
had
longed
and
whom
she
was
now
she
had
grown
stouter
and
so
that
it
was
difficult
to
recognize
in
this
motherly
woman
the
lively
natasha
of
former
her
features
were
more
defined
and
had
a
and
serene
in
her
face
there
was
none
of
the
animation
that
had
formerly
burned
there
and
constituted
its
now
her
face
and
body
were
often
all
that
one
and
her
soul
was
not
visible
at
all
that
struck
the
eye
was
a
and
fertile
the
old
fire
very
rarely
kindled
in
her
face
that
happened
only
as
was
the
case
that
her
husband
returned
or
a
sick
child
was
or
when
she
and
countess
mary
spoke
of
prince
andrew
never
mentioned
him
to
her
who
she
imagined
was
jealous
of
prince
or
on
the
rare
occasions
when
something
happened
to
induce
her
to
a
practice
she
had
quite
abandoned
since
her
at
the
rare
moments
when
the
old
fire
did
kindle
in
her
fully
developed
body
she
was
even
more
attractive
than
in
former
since
their
marriage
natasha
and
her
husband
had
lived
in
in
on
their
estate
near
or
with
her
that
is
to
in
the
young
countess
bezukhova
was
not
often
seen
in
and
those
who
met
her
there
were
not
pleased
with
her
and
found
her
neither
attractive
nor
not
that
natasha
liked
did
not
know
whether
she
liked
it
or
she
even
thought
that
she
did
with
her
her
the
nursing
of
her
and
sharing
every
moment
of
her
she
had
demands
on
her
time
which
could
be
satisfied
only
by
renouncing
all
who
had
known
natasha
before
her
marriage
wondered
at
the
change
in
her
as
at
something
only
the
old
countess
with
her
maternal
instinct
had
realized
that
all
outbursts
had
been
due
to
her
need
of
children
and
a
she
herself
had
once
exclaimed
at
otradnoe
not
so
much
in
fun
as
in
her
mother
was
now
surprised
at
the
surprise
expressed
by
those
who
had
never
understood
and
she
kept
saying
that
she
had
always
known
that
natasha
would
make
an
exemplary
wife
and
she
lets
her
love
of
her
husband
and
children
overflow
all
said
the
that
it
even
becomes
natasha
did
not
follow
the
golden
rule
advocated
by
clever
especially
by
the
which
says
that
a
girl
should
not
let
herself
go
when
she
should
not
neglect
her
should
be
even
more
careful
of
her
appearance
than
when
she
was
and
should
fascinate
her
husband
as
much
as
she
did
before
he
became
her
natasha
on
the
contrary
had
at
once
abandoned
all
her
of
which
her
singing
had
been
an
unusually
powerful
she
gave
it
up
just
because
it
was
so
powerfully
she
took
no
pains
with
her
manners
or
with
delicacy
of
or
with
her
or
to
show
herself
to
her
husband
in
her
most
becoming
or
to
avoid
inconveniencing
him
by
being
too
she
acted
in
contradiction
to
all
those
she
felt
that
the
allurements
instinct
had
formerly
taught
her
to
use
would
now
be
merely
ridiculous
in
the
eyes
of
her
to
whom
she
had
from
the
first
moment
given
herself
up
with
her
whole
leaving
no
corner
of
it
hidden
from
she
felt
that
her
unity
with
her
husband
was
not
maintained
by
the
poetic
feelings
that
had
attracted
him
to
but
by
something
but
firm
as
the
bond
between
her
own
body
and
to
fluff
out
her
put
on
fashionable
and
sing
romantic
songs
to
fascinate
her
husband
would
have
seemed
as
strange
as
to
adorn
herself
to
attract
to
adorn
herself
for
others
might
perhaps
have
been
did
not
she
had
no
time
at
all
for
the
chief
reason
for
devoting
no
time
either
to
to
or
to
choosing
her
words
was
that
she
really
had
no
time
to
spare
for
these
we
know
that
man
has
the
faculty
of
becoming
completely
absorbed
in
a
subject
however
trivial
it
may
and
that
there
is
no
subject
so
trivial
that
it
will
not
grow
to
infinite
proportions
if
entire
attention
is
devoted
to
the
subject
which
wholly
engrossed
attention
was
her
that
her
husband
whom
she
had
to
keep
so
that
he
should
belong
entirely
to
her
and
to
the
and
the
children
whom
she
had
to
bring
into
the
and
bring
and
the
deeper
she
not
with
her
mind
only
but
with
her
whole
her
whole
into
the
subject
that
absorbed
the
larger
did
that
subject
grow
and
the
weaker
and
more
inadequate
did
her
powers
so
that
she
concentrated
them
wholly
on
that
one
thing
and
yet
was
unable
to
accomplish
all
that
she
considered
there
were
then
as
now
conversations
and
discussions
about
the
relations
of
husband
and
wife
and
their
freedom
and
though
these
themes
were
not
yet
termed
questions
as
they
are
but
these
topics
were
not
merely
uninteresting
to
she
positively
did
not
understand
these
then
as
existed
only
for
those
who
see
nothing
in
marriage
but
the
pleasure
married
people
get
from
one
that
only
the
beginnings
of
marriage
and
not
its
whole
which
lies
in
the
discussions
and
questions
of
that
which
are
like
the
question
of
how
to
get
the
greatest
gratification
from
did
not
then
and
do
not
now
exist
for
those
for
whom
the
purpose
of
a
dinner
is
the
nourishment
it
and
the
purpose
of
marriage
is
the
if
the
purpose
of
dinner
is
to
nourish
the
a
man
who
eats
two
dinners
at
once
may
perhaps
get
more
enjoyment
but
will
not
attain
his
for
his
stomach
will
not
digest
the
two
if
the
purpose
of
marriage
is
the
the
person
who
wishes
to
have
many
wives
or
husbands
may
perhaps
obtain
much
but
in
that
case
will
not
have
a
if
the
purpose
of
food
is
nourishment
and
the
purpose
of
marriage
is
the
the
whole
question
resolves
itself
into
not
eating
more
than
one
can
and
not
having
more
wives
or
husbands
than
are
needed
for
the
one
wife
or
one
natasha
needed
a
a
husband
was
given
her
and
he
gave
her
a
and
she
not
only
saw
no
need
of
any
other
or
better
but
as
all
the
powers
of
her
soul
were
intent
on
serving
that
husband
and
she
could
not
imagine
and
saw
no
interest
in
imagining
how
it
would
be
if
things
were
natasha
did
not
care
for
society
in
but
prized
the
more
the
society
of
her
and
her
her
and
she
valued
the
company
of
those
to
whom
she
could
come
striding
disheveled
from
the
nursery
in
her
dressing
and
with
joyful
face
show
a
yellow
instead
of
a
green
stain
on
and
from
whom
she
could
hear
reassuring
words
to
the
effect
that
baby
was
much
to
such
an
extent
had
natasha
let
herself
go
that
the
way
she
dressed
and
did
her
her
and
her
was
jealous
of
of
the
and
of
every
pretty
or
habitual
subjects
of
jest
to
those
about
the
general
opinion
was
that
pierre
was
under
his
which
was
really
from
the
very
first
days
of
their
married
life
natasha
had
announced
her
pierre
was
greatly
surprised
by
his
to
him
a
perfectly
novel
that
every
moment
of
his
life
belonged
to
her
and
to
the
his
demands
astonished
but
they
also
flattered
and
he
submitted
to
subjection
consisted
in
the
fact
that
he
not
only
dared
not
flirt
but
dared
not
even
speak
smilingly
any
other
did
not
dare
dine
at
the
club
as
a
did
not
dare
spend
money
on
a
and
did
not
dare
absent
himself
for
any
length
of
except
on
which
his
wife
included
his
intellectual
which
she
did
not
in
the
least
understand
but
to
which
she
attributed
great
to
make
up
for
at
home
pierre
had
the
right
to
regulate
his
life
and
that
of
the
whole
family
exactly
as
he
at
home
natasha
placed
herself
in
the
position
of
a
slave
to
her
and
the
whole
household
went
on
tiptoe
when
he
was
was
reading
or
writing
in
his
pierre
had
but
to
show
a
partiality
for
anything
to
get
just
what
he
liked
done
he
had
only
to
express
a
wish
and
natasha
would
jump
up
and
run
to
fulfill
the
entire
household
was
governed
according
to
supposed
that
by
his
wishes
which
natasha
tried
to
their
way
of
life
and
place
of
their
acquaintances
and
the
were
all
selected
not
merely
with
regard
to
expressed
but
to
what
natasha
from
the
thoughts
he
expressed
in
conversation
supposed
his
wishes
to
and
she
deduced
the
essentials
of
his
wishes
quite
and
having
once
arrived
at
them
clung
to
them
when
pierre
himself
wanted
to
change
his
mind
she
would
fight
him
with
his
own
thus
in
a
time
of
trouble
ever
memorable
to
him
after
the
birth
of
their
first
child
who
was
when
they
had
to
change
the
wet
nurse
three
times
and
natasha
fell
ill
from
pierre
one
day
told
her
of
with
which
he
quite
that
to
have
a
wet
nurse
is
unnatural
and
when
her
next
baby
was
despite
the
opposition
of
her
the
and
even
of
her
husband
who
were
all
vigorously
opposed
to
her
nursing
her
baby
a
thing
then
unheard
of
and
considered
insisted
on
having
her
own
and
after
that
nursed
all
her
babies
it
very
often
happened
that
in
a
moment
of
irritation
husband
and
wife
would
have
a
but
long
afterwards
pierre
to
his
surprise
and
delight
would
find
in
his
ideas
and
actions
the
very
thought
against
which
she
had
but
divested
of
everything
superfluous
that
in
the
excitement
of
the
dispute
he
had
added
when
expressing
his
after
seven
years
of
marriage
pierre
had
the
joyous
and
firm
consciousness
that
he
was
not
a
bad
and
he
felt
this
because
he
saw
himself
reflected
in
his
he
felt
the
good
and
bad
within
himself
inextricably
mingled
and
but
only
what
was
really
good
in
him
was
reflected
in
his
all
that
was
not
quite
good
was
and
this
was
not
the
result
of
logical
reasoning
but
was
a
direct
and
mysterious
chapter
xi
two
months
previously
when
pierre
was
already
staying
with
the
rostovs
he
had
received
a
letter
from
prince
asking
him
to
come
to
petersburg
to
confer
on
some
important
questions
that
were
being
discussed
there
by
a
society
of
which
pierre
was
one
of
the
principal
on
reading
that
letter
always
read
her
natasha
herself
suggested
that
he
should
go
to
though
she
would
feel
his
absence
very
she
attributed
immense
importance
to
all
her
intellectual
and
abstract
interests
though
she
did
not
understand
and
she
always
dreaded
being
a
hindrance
to
him
in
such
to
timid
look
of
inquiry
after
reading
the
letter
she
replied
by
asking
him
to
but
to
fix
a
definite
date
for
his
he
was
given
four
leave
of
ever
since
that
leave
of
absence
had
more
than
a
fortnight
natasha
had
been
in
a
constant
state
of
and
now
a
general
on
the
retired
list
and
much
dissatisfied
with
the
present
state
of
had
arrived
during
that
he
looked
at
natasha
with
sorrow
and
surprise
as
at
a
bad
likeness
of
a
person
once
a
dejected
random
and
talk
about
the
nursery
was
all
he
saw
and
heard
from
his
former
natasha
was
sad
and
irritable
all
that
especially
when
her
her
or
countess
mary
in
their
efforts
to
console
her
tried
to
excuse
pierre
and
suggested
reasons
for
his
delay
in
all
all
discussions
which
lead
to
nothing
and
all
those
idiotic
natasha
declared
of
the
very
affairs
in
the
immense
importance
of
which
she
firmly
and
she
would
go
to
the
nursery
to
nurse
her
only
no
one
else
could
tell
her
anything
so
comforting
or
so
reasonable
as
this
little
creature
when
he
lay
at
her
breast
and
she
was
conscious
of
the
movement
of
his
lips
and
the
snuffling
of
his
little
that
creature
are
you
are
you
would
like
to
pay
him
you
are
here
am
and
i
am
and
that
was
it
was
more
than
during
that
fortnight
of
anxiety
natasha
resorted
to
the
baby
for
comfort
so
and
fussed
over
him
so
that
she
overfed
him
and
he
fell
she
was
terrified
by
his
and
yet
that
was
just
what
she
while
attending
to
him
she
bore
the
anxiety
about
her
husband
more
she
was
nursing
her
boy
when
the
sound
of
sleigh
was
heard
at
the
front
and
the
old
how
to
please
her
entered
the
room
inaudibly
but
hurriedly
and
with
a
beaming
he
natasha
asked
quickly
in
a
afraid
to
move
lest
she
should
rouse
the
dozing
whispered
the
the
blood
rushed
to
face
and
her
feet
involuntarily
but
she
could
not
jump
up
and
run
the
baby
again
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
at
he
seemed
to
be
and
again
lazily
smacked
his
cautiously
withdrawing
her
natasha
rocked
him
a
handed
him
to
the
and
went
with
rapid
steps
toward
the
but
at
the
door
she
stopped
as
if
her
conscience
reproached
her
for
having
in
her
joy
left
the
child
too
and
she
glanced
the
nurse
with
raised
elbows
was
lifting
the
infant
over
the
rail
of
his
she
with
the
kind
of
familiarity
that
grows
up
between
a
nurse
and
her
natasha
ran
with
light
footsteps
to
the
who
had
come
out
of
the
study
into
the
dancing
room
with
his
now
for
the
first
time
recognized
the
old
a
flood
of
joyful
light
poured
from
her
transfigured
she
exclaimed
as
she
ran
and
denisov
felt
that
he
too
was
delighted
that
whom
he
did
not
much
care
had
on
reaching
the
vestibule
natasha
saw
a
tall
figure
in
a
fur
coat
unwinding
his
really
he
has
she
said
to
and
rushing
at
him
embraced
pressed
his
head
to
her
and
then
pushed
him
back
and
gazed
at
his
happy
covered
with
it
is
happy
and
then
all
at
once
she
remembered
the
tortures
of
suspense
she
had
experienced
for
the
last
and
the
joy
that
had
lit
up
her
face
she
frowned
and
overwhelmed
pierre
with
a
torrent
of
reproaches
and
angry
all
very
well
for
you
are
had
a
good
but
what
about
you
might
at
least
have
shown
consideration
for
the
i
am
nursing
and
my
milk
was
petya
was
at
but
you
were
enjoying
pierre
knew
he
was
not
to
for
he
could
not
have
come
he
knew
this
outburst
was
unseemly
and
would
blow
over
in
a
minute
or
above
all
he
knew
that
he
himself
was
bright
and
he
wanted
to
smile
but
dared
not
even
think
of
doing
he
made
a
frightened
face
and
bent
could
on
my
but
how
is
right
come
i
wonder
not
if
only
you
could
see
what
i
was
like
without
how
i
are
she
not
letting
go
of
his
and
they
went
to
their
when
nicholas
and
his
wife
came
to
look
for
pierre
he
was
in
the
nursery
holding
his
baby
who
was
again
on
his
huge
right
palm
and
dandling
a
blissful
bright
smile
was
fixed
on
the
broad
face
with
its
toothless
open
the
storm
was
long
since
over
and
there
was
joyous
sunshine
on
face
as
she
gazed
tenderly
at
her
husband
and
have
you
talked
everything
well
over
with
prince
she
he
holds
it
meant
the
how
he
did
frighten
seen
the
is
it
true
in
love
with
just
at
that
moment
nicholas
and
countess
mary
came
pierre
with
the
baby
on
his
hand
kissed
and
replied
to
their
but
in
spite
of
much
that
was
interesting
and
had
to
be
the
baby
with
the
little
cap
on
its
unsteady
head
evidently
absorbed
all
his
said
countess
looking
at
and
playing
with
the
she
turning
to
her
understand
how
it
is
you
see
the
charm
of
these
delicious
and
replied
looking
coldly
at
the
lump
of
come
yet
such
an
affectionate
said
countess
vindicating
her
only
after
they
are
a
year
old
or
pierre
nurses
them
said
says
his
hand
is
just
made
for
a
just
not
for
pierre
suddenly
exclaimed
with
a
and
shifting
the
baby
he
gave
him
to
the
chapter
xii
as
in
every
large
there
were
at
bald
hills
several
perfectly
distinct
worlds
which
merged
into
one
harmonious
though
each
retained
its
own
peculiarities
and
made
concessions
to
the
every
joyful
or
that
took
place
in
that
house
was
important
to
all
these
but
each
had
its
own
special
reasons
to
rejoice
or
grieve
over
that
occurrence
independently
of
the
for
return
was
a
joyful
and
important
event
and
they
all
felt
it
to
be
the
most
reliable
judges
of
their
masters
because
they
judge
not
by
their
conversation
or
expressions
of
feeling
but
by
their
acts
and
way
of
glad
of
return
because
they
knew
that
when
he
was
there
count
nicholas
would
cease
going
every
day
to
attend
to
the
and
would
be
in
better
spirits
and
and
also
because
they
would
all
receive
handsome
presents
for
the
the
children
and
their
governesses
were
glad
of
return
because
no
one
else
drew
them
into
the
social
life
of
the
household
as
he
he
alone
could
play
on
the
clavichord
that
ecossaise
only
to
as
he
all
possible
dances
could
be
and
they
felt
sure
he
had
brought
presents
for
them
young
now
a
slim
lad
of
delicate
and
with
curly
hair
and
beautiful
was
delighted
because
uncle
pierre
as
he
called
him
was
the
object
of
his
rapturous
and
passionate
no
one
had
instilled
into
him
this
love
for
pierre
whom
he
saw
only
countess
mary
who
had
brought
him
up
had
done
her
utmost
to
make
him
love
her
husband
as
she
loved
and
little
nicholas
did
love
his
but
loved
him
with
just
a
shade
of
he
he
did
not
want
to
be
an
hussar
or
a
knight
of
george
like
his
uncle
he
wanted
to
be
and
kind
like
in
presence
his
face
always
shone
with
pleasure
and
he
flushed
and
was
breathless
when
pierre
spoke
to
he
did
not
miss
a
single
word
he
and
would
with
dessalles
or
by
recall
and
reconsider
the
meaning
of
everything
pierre
had
past
life
and
his
unhappiness
prior
to
1812
which
young
nicholas
had
formed
a
vague
poetic
picture
from
some
words
he
had
his
adventures
in
his
platon
karataev
whom
he
had
heard
from
his
love
for
natasha
whom
the
lad
was
also
particularly
and
especially
friendship
with
the
father
whom
nicholas
could
not
this
made
pierre
in
his
eyes
a
hero
and
a
from
broken
remarks
about
natasha
and
his
from
the
emotion
with
which
pierre
spoke
of
that
dead
and
from
the
reverent
tenderness
with
which
natasha
spoke
of
the
who
was
only
just
beginning
to
guess
what
love
derived
the
notion
that
his
father
had
loved
natasha
and
when
dying
had
left
her
to
his
but
the
father
whom
the
boy
did
not
remember
appeared
to
him
a
divinity
who
could
not
be
and
of
whom
he
never
thought
without
a
swelling
heart
and
tears
of
sadness
and
so
the
boy
also
was
happy
that
pierre
had
the
guests
welcomed
pierre
because
he
always
helped
to
enliven
and
unite
any
company
he
was
the
members
of
the
not
to
mention
his
were
pleased
to
have
back
a
friend
whose
presence
made
life
run
more
smoothly
and
the
old
ladies
were
pleased
with
the
presents
he
brought
and
especially
that
natasha
would
now
be
herself
pierre
felt
the
different
outlooks
of
these
various
worlds
and
made
haste
to
satisfy
all
their
though
the
most
and
forgetful
of
with
the
aid
of
a
list
his
wife
drew
had
now
bought
not
forgetting
his
nor
the
dress
material
for
a
present
to
nor
toys
for
his
in
the
early
days
of
his
marriage
it
had
seemed
strange
to
him
that
his
wife
should
expect
him
not
to
forget
to
procure
all
the
things
he
undertook
to
and
he
had
been
taken
aback
by
her
serious
annoyance
when
on
his
first
trip
he
forgot
but
in
time
he
grew
used
to
this
knowing
that
natasha
asked
nothing
for
and
gave
him
commissions
for
others
only
when
he
himself
had
offered
to
undertake
he
now
found
an
unexpected
and
childlike
pleasure
in
this
purchase
of
presents
for
everyone
in
the
and
never
forgot
if
he
now
incurred
censure
it
was
only
for
buying
too
many
and
too
expensive
to
her
other
defects
most
people
thought
but
which
to
pierre
were
of
untidiness
and
neglect
of
she
now
added
from
the
time
that
pierre
began
life
as
a
family
man
on
a
footing
entailing
heavy
he
had
noticed
to
his
surprise
that
he
spent
only
half
as
much
as
and
that
his
had
been
in
disorder
of
chiefly
because
of
his
first
begun
to
life
was
cheaper
because
it
was
that
most
expensive
the
kind
of
life
that
can
be
changed
at
any
was
no
longer
his
nor
did
he
wish
for
he
felt
that
his
way
of
life
had
now
been
settled
once
for
all
till
death
and
that
to
change
it
was
not
in
his
and
so
that
way
of
life
proved
with
a
smiling
face
pierre
was
sorting
his
do
you
think
of
said
unrolling
a
piece
of
stuff
like
a
who
was
sitting
opposite
to
him
with
her
eldest
daughter
on
her
turned
her
sparkling
eyes
swiftly
from
her
husband
to
the
things
he
showed
for
she
felt
the
quality
of
the
was
a
ruble
an
i
pierre
told
her
the
natasha
pleased
the
children
will
be
and
mamma
only
you
need
not
have
bought
me
she
unable
to
suppress
a
smile
as
she
gazed
admiringly
at
a
gold
comb
set
with
of
a
kind
then
just
coming
into
tempted
she
kept
on
telling
me
to
buy
returned
am
i
to
wear
and
natasha
stuck
it
in
her
coil
of
i
take
little
masha
into
perhaps
they
will
be
fashionable
again
by
go
and
collecting
the
presents
they
went
first
to
the
nursery
and
then
to
the
old
the
countess
was
sitting
with
her
companion
playing
patience
as
when
pierre
and
natasha
came
into
the
drawing
room
with
parcels
under
their
the
countess
was
now
over
was
quite
and
wore
a
cap
with
a
frill
that
surrounded
her
her
face
had
her
upper
lip
had
sunk
and
her
eyes
were
after
the
deaths
of
her
son
and
husband
in
such
rapid
she
felt
herself
a
being
accidentally
forgotten
in
this
world
and
left
without
aim
or
object
for
her
she
or
kept
but
did
not
life
gave
her
no
new
she
wanted
nothing
from
life
but
and
that
tranquillity
only
death
could
give
but
until
death
came
she
had
to
go
on
that
to
use
her
vital
a
peculiarity
one
sees
in
very
young
children
and
very
old
people
was
particularly
evident
in
her
life
had
no
external
a
need
to
exercise
her
various
functions
and
inclinations
was
she
had
to
give
vent
to
her
and
so
merely
because
she
had
a
a
and
a
she
did
these
things
not
under
any
external
impulse
as
people
in
the
full
vigor
of
life
when
behind
the
purpose
for
which
they
strive
that
of
exercising
their
functions
remains
she
talked
only
because
she
physically
needed
to
exercise
her
tongue
and
she
cried
as
a
child
because
her
nose
had
to
be
and
so
what
for
people
in
their
full
vigor
is
an
aim
was
for
her
evidently
merely
a
thus
in
the
if
she
had
eaten
anything
rich
the
day
felt
a
need
of
being
angry
and
would
choose
as
the
handiest
pretext
she
would
begin
to
say
something
to
her
in
a
low
tone
from
the
other
end
of
the
seems
a
little
warmer
my
she
would
and
when
belova
she
would
mutter
how
stupid
and
deaf
she
another
pretext
would
be
her
which
would
seem
too
dry
or
too
damp
or
not
rubbed
fine
after
these
fits
of
irritability
her
face
would
grow
and
her
maids
knew
by
infallible
symptoms
when
belova
would
again
be
the
snuff
and
the
face
just
as
she
needed
to
work
off
her
spleen
so
she
had
sometimes
to
exercise
her
faculty
of
the
pretext
for
that
was
a
game
of
when
she
needed
to
the
deceased
count
would
be
the
when
she
wanted
to
be
nicholas
and
his
health
would
be
the
and
when
she
felt
a
need
to
speak
the
pretext
would
be
countess
when
her
vocal
organs
needed
which
was
usually
toward
seven
when
she
had
had
an
rest
in
a
darkened
the
pretext
would
be
the
retelling
of
the
same
stories
over
and
over
again
to
the
same
the
old
condition
was
understood
by
the
whole
household
though
no
one
ever
spoke
of
and
they
all
made
every
possible
effort
to
satisfy
her
only
by
a
rare
glance
exchanged
with
a
sad
smile
between
and
countess
mary
was
the
common
understanding
of
her
condition
but
those
glances
expressed
something
they
said
that
she
had
played
her
part
in
that
what
they
now
saw
was
not
her
whole
that
we
must
all
become
like
and
that
they
were
glad
to
yield
to
to
restrain
themselves
for
this
once
precious
being
formerly
as
full
of
life
as
but
now
so
much
to
be
said
these
only
the
really
the
stupid
ones
of
that
and
the
little
children
failed
to
understand
this
and
avoided
chapter
xiii
when
pierre
and
his
wife
entered
the
drawing
room
the
countess
was
in
one
of
her
customary
states
in
which
she
needed
the
mental
exertion
of
playing
and
by
force
of
habit
she
greeted
him
with
the
words
she
always
used
when
pierre
or
her
son
returned
after
an
my
high
we
were
all
weary
of
waiting
for
thank
and
received
her
presents
with
another
customary
not
the
gift
my
but
that
you
give
it
to
an
old
it
was
evident
that
she
was
not
pleased
by
arrival
at
that
moment
when
it
diverted
her
attention
from
the
unfinished
she
finished
her
game
of
patience
and
only
then
examined
the
they
consisted
of
a
box
for
of
splendid
a
blue
sevres
tea
cup
with
shepherdesses
depicted
on
it
and
with
a
and
a
gold
snuffbox
with
the
portrait
on
the
lid
which
pierre
had
had
done
by
a
miniaturist
in
the
countess
had
long
wished
for
such
a
but
as
she
did
not
want
to
cry
just
then
she
glanced
indifferently
at
the
portrait
and
gave
her
attention
chiefly
to
the
box
for
my
you
have
cheered
me
said
she
as
she
always
best
of
all
you
have
brought
yourself
i
never
saw
anything
like
you
ought
to
give
your
wife
a
what
are
we
to
do
with
she
is
like
a
mad
woman
when
you
are
see
remember
she
went
repeating
her
usual
anna
she
added
to
her
what
a
box
for
cards
my
son
has
brought
belova
admired
the
presents
and
was
delighted
with
her
dress
though
countess
and
denisov
had
much
to
talk
about
that
they
could
not
discuss
before
the
old
that
anything
was
hidden
from
but
because
she
had
dropped
so
far
behindhand
in
many
things
that
had
they
begun
to
converse
in
her
presence
they
would
have
had
to
answer
inopportune
questions
and
to
repeat
what
they
had
already
told
her
many
that
was
dead
and
was
which
she
would
again
be
unable
to
they
sat
at
tea
round
the
samovar
in
the
drawing
room
from
and
pierre
answered
the
questions
as
to
whether
prince
vasili
had
aged
and
whether
countess
mary
alexeevna
had
sent
greetings
and
still
thought
of
and
other
matters
that
interested
no
one
and
to
which
she
herself
was
conversation
of
this
interesting
to
no
one
yet
continued
all
through
all
the
members
of
the
family
were
assembled
near
the
round
tea
table
at
which
sonya
presided
beside
the
the
children
with
their
tutors
and
governesses
had
had
tea
and
their
voices
were
audible
from
the
next
at
tea
all
sat
in
their
accustomed
nicholas
beside
the
stove
at
a
small
table
where
his
tea
was
handed
to
the
old
gray
borzoi
bitch
of
the
first
with
a
quite
gray
face
and
large
black
eyes
that
seemed
more
prominent
than
lay
on
the
armchair
beside
whose
curly
and
whiskers
had
turned
half
sat
beside
countess
mary
with
his
tunic
pierre
sat
between
his
wife
and
the
old
he
spoke
of
what
he
knew
might
interest
the
old
lady
and
that
she
could
he
told
her
of
external
social
events
and
of
the
people
who
had
formed
the
circle
of
her
contemporaries
and
had
once
been
a
and
distinct
but
who
were
now
for
the
most
part
scattered
about
the
world
and
like
herself
were
garnering
the
last
ears
of
the
harvests
they
had
sown
in
earlier
but
to
the
old
countess
those
contemporaries
of
hers
seemed
to
be
the
only
serious
and
real
natasha
saw
by
animation
that
his
visit
had
been
interesting
and
that
he
had
much
to
tell
them
but
dare
not
say
it
before
the
old
not
being
a
member
of
the
did
not
understand
caution
and
as
a
much
interested
in
what
was
occurring
in
kept
urging
pierre
to
tell
them
about
what
had
happened
in
the
semenovsk
then
about
and
then
about
the
bible
once
or
twice
pierre
was
carried
away
and
began
to
speak
of
these
but
nicholas
and
natasha
always
brought
him
back
to
the
health
of
prince
ivan
and
countess
mary
and
all
this
and
denisov
that
weally
still
going
pierre
more
than
the
bible
society

the
whole

mon
cher
asked
the
who
had
finished
her
tea
and
evidently
needed
a
pretext
for
being
angry
after
her
are
you
saying
about
the

nicholas
knowing
how
to
translate
things
into
his
alexander
golitsyn
has
founded
a
society
and
in
consequence
has
great
they
and
incautiously
remarked
now
the
whole
and
what
a
they
see
treason
everywhere
and
are
afraid
of
and
how
is
prince
alexander
to
he
is
a
most
estimable
i
used
to
meet
him
at
mary
said
the
countess
in
an
offended
and
still
more
offended
that
they
all
remained
she
went
everyone
finds
a
gospel
and
what
harm
is
there
in
and
she
rose
else
got
up
and
with
a
severe
expression
sailed
back
to
her
table
in
the
sitting
the
melancholy
silence
that
followed
was
broken
by
the
sounds
of
the
voices
and
laughter
from
the
next
evidently
some
jolly
excitement
was
going
on
little
gleeful
yell
rose
above
them
pierre
exchanged
glances
with
countess
mary
and
nicholas
he
never
lost
sight
and
smiled
delightful
said

that
anna
makarovna
has
finished
her

and
said
jumping
he
stopping
at
the
especially
fond
of
that
it
is
always
the
first
thing
that
tells
me
all
is
when
i
was
driving
here
the
nearer
i
got
to
the
house
the
more
anxious
i
as
i
entered
the
anteroom
i
heard
peals
of
laughter
and
that
meant
that
all
was
i
know
that
said
i
go
those
stockings
are
to
be
a
surprise
for
pierre
went
to
the
and
the
shouting
and
laughter
grew
still
anna
voice
was
heard
here
into
the
middle
of
the
room
and
at
the
word
of
and
when
i
say
you
stand
and
you
in
my
said
and
a
silence
and
a
rapturously
breathless
cry
of
voices
filled
the
they
this
meant
two
which
by
a
secret
process
known
only
to
herself
anna
makarovna
used
to
knit
at
the
same
time
on
the
same
and
when
they
were
she
always
triumphantly
one
out
of
the
in
the
chapter
xiv
soon
after
this
the
children
came
in
to
say
good
they
kissed
the
tutors
and
governesses
made
their
and
they
went
only
young
nicholas
and
his
tutor
dessalles
whispered
to
the
boy
to
come
monsieur
i
will
ask
my
aunt
to
let
me
replied
nicholas
bolkonski
also
in
a
please
let
me
said
going
up
to
his
his
face
expressed
and
countess
mary
glanced
at
him
and
turned
to
you
are
here
he
tear
himself
she
will
bring
him
to
you
monsieur
good
said
giving
his
hand
to
the
swiss
and
he
turned
to
young
nicholas
with
a
and
i
seen
anything
of
one
another
how
like
he
is
he
addressing
countess
my
asked
the
flushing
crimson
and
looking
up
at
pierre
with
ecstatic
pierre
and
went
on
with
what
he
had
been
saying
when
the
children
had
countess
mary
sat
down
doing
natasha
did
not
take
her
eyes
off
her
nicholas
and
denisov
asked
for
their
went
to
fetch
more
tea
from
sat
weary
but
resolute
at
the
questioned
the
delicate
boy
sat
with
shining
eyes
unnoticed
in
a
starting
every
now
and
then
and
muttering
something
to
and
evidently
experiencing
a
new
and
powerful
emotion
as
he
turned
his
curly
with
his
thin
neck
exposed
by
his
toward
the
place
where
pierre
the
conversation
turned
on
the
contemporary
gossip
about
those
in
in
which
most
people
see
the
chief
interest
of
home
dissatisfied
with
the
government
on
account
of
his
own
disappointments
in
the
heard
with
pleasure
of
the
things
done
in
petersburg
which
seemed
to
him
and
made
forcible
and
sharp
comments
on
what
pierre
told
used
to
have
to
be
a
one
must
dance
with
tatawinova
and
madame
and
wead
and
the
they
should
let
that
fine
fellow
bonaparte
knock
all
this
nonsense
out
of
fancy
giving
the
command
of
the
semenov
wegiment
to
a
fellow
like
that
he
though
free
from
readiness
to
find
fault
with
also
thought
that
discussion
of
the
government
was
a
very
serious
and
weighty
and
the
fact
that
a
had
been
appointed
minister
of
this
and
b
governor
general
of
and
that
the
emperor
had
said
and
this
minister
seemed
to
him
very
and
so
he
thought
it
necessary
to
take
an
interest
in
these
things
and
to
question
the
questions
put
by
these
two
kept
the
conversation
from
changing
its
ordinary
character
of
gossip
about
the
higher
government
but
knowing
all
her
ways
and
saw
that
he
had
long
been
wishing
but
had
been
unable
to
divert
the
conversation
to
another
channel
and
express
his
own
deeply
felt
idea
for
the
sake
of
which
he
had
gone
to
petersburg
to
consult
with
his
new
friend
prince
and
she
helped
him
by
asking
how
his
affairs
with
prince
theodore
had
was
it
asked
the
same
said
looking
round
at
his
sees
that
things
are
going
so
badly
that
they
cannot
be
allowed
to
go
on
so
and
that
it
is
the
duty
of
all
decent
men
to
counteract
it
as
far
as
they
can
decent
men
nicholas
frowning
can
be
into
my
said
who
had
long
expected
to
be
fetched
to
nurse
her
now
heard
the
nurse
calling
her
and
went
to
the
countess
mary
followed
the
men
went
into
the
study
and
little
nicholas
bolkonski
followed
them
unnoticed
by
his
uncle
and
sat
down
at
the
writing
table
in
a
shady
corner
by
the
what
would
you
asked
some
fantastic
said

not
sitting
down
but
pacing

sometimes
stopping

the
emperor

not
look
into

has
abandoned
himself
altogether
to
this

not
tolerate

in
anyone

only
for

only
these
people
sans

can
give

who
recklessly
hack
at

and
tutti
you
will
agree
that
if
you
did
not
look
after
your
estates
yourself
but
only
wanted
a
quiet
the
harsher
your
steward
was
the
more
readily
your
object
might
be
he
said

without
faith
or
what
does
that
lead

everything
is
going
to
robbery
in
the

in

nothing
but
and
military
the
people
are
enlightenment
is
all
that
is
young
and
honest
is
everyone
sees
that
this
cannot
go
everything
is
strained
to
such
a
degree
that
it
will
certainly
said
pierre
those
who
examine
the
actions
of
any
government
have
always
said
since
governments
told
them
just
one
thing
in
you
know
said
with
a
meaning
glance
from
under
his
theodore
and
all
to
encourage
culture
and
philanthropy
is
all
very
well
of
the
aim
is
excellent
but
in
the
present
circumstances
something
else
is
at
that
moment
nicholas
noticed
the
presence
of
his
his
face
darkened
and
he
went
up
to
the
are
you
let
him
said
taking
nicholas
by
the
arm
and
is
not
i
told
something
else
is
when
you
stand
expecting
the
overstrained
string
to
snap
at
any
when
everyone
is
expecting
the
inevitable
as
many
as
possible
must
join
hands
as
closely
as
they
can
to
withstand
the
general
everything
that
is
young
and
strong
is
being
enticed
away
and
one
is
lured
by
another
by
a
third
by
ambition
or
and
they
go
over
to
that
no
independent
such
as
you
or
are
what
i
say
is
widen
the
scope
of
our
let
the
mot
be
not
virtue
alone
but
independence
and
action
as
who
had
left
his
irritably
pushed
up
an
sat
down
in
and
listened
to
coughing
discontentedly
and
frowning
more
and
action
with
what
he
what
position
will
you
adopt
toward
the
the
position
of
the
society
need
not
be
secret
if
the
government
allows
not
merely
is
it
not
hostile
to
but
it
is
a
society
of
true
society
of
gentlemen
in
the
full
meaning
of
that
it
is
only
to
prevent
some
pugachev
or
other
from
killing
my
children
and
and
arakcheev
from
sending
me
off
to
some
military
we
join
hands
only
for
the
public
welfare
and
the
general
but
a
secret
society
and
therefore
a
hostile
and
harmful
one
which
can
only
cause

to
her
that
was
all
extremely
simple
and
that
she
had
known
it
a
long
time
seemed
so
to
her
because
she
knew
that
it
sprang
from
whole
but
it
was
his
animated
and
enthusiastic
appearance
that
made
her
the
boy
with
the
thin
neck
stretching
out
from

everyone
had

more

all

well
for
the

i
understand
it

denisov
in

loud
and
resolute
agwee
that

the

if
not

have
a
bunt

natasha
began
to
but
nicholas
knitted
his
brows
still
more
and
began
proving
to
pierre
that
there
was
no
prospect
of
any
great
change
and
that
all
the
danger
he
spoke
of
existed
only
in
his
pierre
maintained
the

as
his
mental
faculties
were
greater
and
more
nicholas
felt
himself
this
made
him
still
for
he
was
fully
not
by
reasoning
but
by
something
within
him
stronger
than
of
the
justice
of

tell
you

nervously
twitching

finally
abandoning

it
to
you
say
that
everything
here
is
rotten
and
that
an
overthrow
is
i
see
but
you
also
say
that
our
oath
of
allegiance
is
a
conditional
and
to
that
i
are
my
best
as
you
but
if
you
formed
a
secret
society
and
began
working
against

what
it
know
it
is
my
duty
to
obey
the

if
arakcheev
ordered
me
to
lead
a
squadron
against

you
i

not

should
do

you
may

awkward
silence
followed
these
natasha
was
the
first
to
defending
her
husband
and
attacking
her
her
defense
was
weak
and
inapt
but
she
attained
her
the
conversation
was
and
no
longer
in
the
unpleasantly
hostile
tone
of
last
when
they
all
got
up
to
go
in
to
little
nicholas
bolkonski
went
up
to
pale
and
with
radiant
if
papa
were
would
he
agree
with
he
and
pierre
suddenly
realized
what
a
and
powerful
process
of
thought
and
feeling
must
have
been
going
on
in
this
boy
during
that
and
remembering
all
he
had
said
he
regretted
that
the
lad
should
have
heard
he
to
give
him
an
i
think
he
said
and
left
the
the
lad
looked
down
and
seemed
now
for
the
first
time
to
notice
what
he
had
done
to
the
things
on
the
he
flushed
and
went
up
to
forgive
i
did
he
pointing
to
the
broken
sealing
wax
and
nicholas
started
all
he
throwing
the
bits
under
the
and
evidently
suppressing
his
vexation
with
he
turned
away
from
the
ought
not
to
have
been
here
at

chapter
xv
the
conversation
at
supper
was
not
about
politics
or
but
turned
on
the
subject
nicholas
liked
of
denisov
started
these
and
pierre
was
particularly
agreeable
and
amusing
about
the
family
separated
on
the
most
friendly
after
supper
having
undressed
in
his
study
and
given
instructions
to
the
steward
who
had
been
waiting
for
went
to
the
bedroom
in
his
dressing
where
he
found
his
wife
still
at
her
are
you
nicholas
countess
mary
she
was
afraid
that
what
she
was
writing
would
not
be
understood
or
approved
by
her
she
had
wanted
to
conceal
what
she
was
writing
from
but
at
the
same
time
was
glad
he
had
surprised
her
at
it
and
that
she
would
now
have
to
tell
she
handing
him
a
blue
exercise
book
filled
with
her
bold
nicholas
repeated
with
a
shade
of
and
he
took
up
the
it
was
in
december
today
when
andrusha
eldest
woke
up
he
did
not
wish
to
dress
and
mademoiselle
louise
sent
for
he
was
naughty
and
i
tried
but
he
only
grew
then
i
took
the
matter
in
i
left
him
alone
and
began
with
help
to
get
the
other
children
telling
him
that
i
did
not
love
for
a
long
time
he
was
as
if
then
he
jumped
out
of
ran
to
me
in
his
and
sobbed
so
that
i
could
not
calm
him
for
a
long
it
was
plain
that
what
troubled
him
most
was
that
he
had
grieved
afterwards
in
the
evening
when
i
gave
him
his
he
again
began
crying
piteously
and
kissing

do
anything
with
him

a
nicholas
have
begun
giving
the
elder
ones
marks
every
showing
how
they
have
nicholas
looked
into
the
radiant
eyes
that
were
gazing
at
and
continued
to
turn
over
the
pages
and
in
the
diary
was
set
down
everything
in
the
lives
that
seemed
noteworthy
to
their
mother
as
showing
their
characters
or
suggesting
general
reflections
on
educational
they
were
for
the
most
part
quite
insignificant
but
did
not
seem
so
to
the
mother
or
to
the
father
now
that
he
read
this
diary
about
his
children
for
the
first
under
the
date
was
mitya
was
naughty
at
papa
said
he
was
to
have
no
he
had
but
looked
so
unhappily
and
greedily
at
the
others
while
they
were
i
think
that
punishment
by
depriving
children
of
sweets
only
develops
their
must
tell
nicholas
nicholas
put
down
the
book
and
looked
at
his
the
radiant
eyes
gazed
at
him
would
he
approve
or
disapprove
of
her
there
could
be
no
doubt
not
only
of
his
approval
but
also
of
his
admiration
for
his
perhaps
it
need
not
be
done
so
thought
or
even
done
at
but
this
continual
spiritual
effort
of
which
the
sole
aim
was
the
moral
welfare
delighted
had
nicholas
been
able
to
analyze
his
feelings
he
would
have
found
that
his
and
proud
love
of
his
wife
rested
on
his
feeling
of
wonder
at
her
spirituality
and
at
the
lofty
moral
almost
beyond
his
in
which
she
had
her
he
was
proud
of
her
intelligence
and
recognized
his
own
insignificance
beside
her
in
the
spiritual
and
rejoiced
all
the
more
that
she
with
such
a
soul
not
only
belonged
to
him
but
was
part
of
quite
my
said
he
with
a
significant
and
after
a
short
pause
he
i
behaved
badly
you
in
the
we
began
and
i
lost
my
but
he
is
such
a
i
know
what
would
become
of
him
if
natasha
keep
him
in
have
you
any
idea
why
he
went
to
they
have
i
said
countess
told
you
nicholas
went
growing
hot
at
the
mere
recollection
of
their
wanted
to
convince
me
that
it
is
every
honest
duty
to
go
against
the
and
that
the
oath
of
allegiance
and
i
am
sorry
you
they
all
fell
on
and
natasha
is
how
she
rules
over
and
yet
there
need
only
be
a
discussion
and
she
has
no
words
of
her
own
but
only
repeats
his
added
yielding
to
that
irresistible
inclination
which
tempts
us
to
judge
those
nearest
and
dearest
to
he
forgot
that
what
he
was
saying
about
natasha
could
have
been
applied
word
for
word
to
himself
in
relation
to
his
i
have
noticed
said
countess
i
told
him
that
duty
and
the
oath
were
above
he
started
proving
goodness
knows
a
pity
you
were
not
would
you
have
i
see
it
you
were
quite
and
i
told
natasha
pierre
says
everybody
is
and
being
and
that
it
is
our
duty
to
help
our
of
course
he
is
right
said
countess
he
forgets
that
we
have
other
duties
nearer
to
duties
indicated
to
us
by
god
and
that
though
we
might
expose
ourselves
to
risks
we
must
not
risk
our
just
what
i
said
to
put
in
who
fancied
he
really
had
said
they
insisted
on
their
own
love
of
neighbor
and
all
this
in
the
presence
of
young
who
had
gone
into
my
study
and
broke
all
my
do
you
know
i
am
often
troubled
about
little
said
countess
is
such
an
exceptional
i
am
afraid
i
neglect
him
in
favor
of
my
we
all
have
children
and
relations
while
he
has
no
he
is
constantly
alone
with
his
i
think
you
need
reproach
yourself
on
his
all
that
the
fondest
mother
could
do
for
her
son
you
have
done
and
are
doing
for
and
of
course
i
am
glad
of
he
is
a
fine
a
fine
this
evening
he
listened
to
pierre
in
a
sort
of
and
we
were
going
in
to
supper
i
looked
and
he
had
broken
everything
on
my
table
to
and
he
told
me
of
it
himself
at
i
never
knew
him
to
tell
an
a
fine
a
fine
repeated
who
at
heart
was
not
fond
of
nicholas
bolkonski
but
was
always
anxious
to
recognize
that
he
was
a
fine
i
am
not
the
same
as
his
own
said
countess
feel
i
am
not
the
same
and
it
troubles
a
wonderful
but
i
am
dreadfully
afraid
for
it
would
be
good
for
him
to
have
it
be
for
next
summer
take
him
to
said
pierre
always
was
a
dreamer
and
always
will
he
returning
to
the
talk
in
the
study
which
had
evidently
disturbed
what
business
is
it
of
mine
what
goes
on
whether
arakcheev
is
and
all
what
business
was
it
of
mine
when
i
married
and
was
so
deep
in
debt
that
i
was
threatened
with
and
had
a
mother
who
could
not
see
or
understand
and
then
there
are
you
and
the
children
and
our
is
it
for
my
own
pleasure
that
i
am
at
the
farm
or
in
the
office
from
morning
to
but
i
know
i
must
work
to
comfort
my
to
repay
and
not
to
leave
the
children
such
beggars
as
i
countess
mary
wanted
to
tell
him
that
man
does
not
live
by
bread
alone
and
that
he
attached
too
much
importance
to
these
but
she
knew
she
must
not
say
this
and
that
it
would
be
useless
to
do
she
only
took
his
hand
and
kissed
he
took
this
as
a
sign
of
approval
and
a
confirmation
of
his
and
after
a
few
reflection
continued
to
think
today
elias
was
his
back
from
the
tambov
estate
and
told
me
they
are
already
offering
eighty
thousand
rubles
for
the
and
with
an
eager
face
nicholas
began
to
speak
of
the
possibility
of
repurchasing
otradnoe
before
and
ten
years
of
life
and
i
shall
leave
the
in
an
excellent
countess
mary
listened
to
her
husband
and
understood
all
that
he
told
she
knew
that
when
he
thought
aloud
in
this
way
he
would
sometimes
ask
her
what
he
had
been
and
be
vexed
if
he
noticed
that
she
had
been
thinking
about
something
but
she
had
to
force
herself
to
for
what
he
was
saying
did
not
interest
her
at
she
looked
at
him
and
did
not
but
about
something
she
felt
a
submissive
tender
love
for
this
man
who
would
never
understand
all
that
she
and
this
seemed
to
make
her
love
for
him
still
stronger
and
added
a
touch
of
passionate
besides
this
feeling
which
absorbed
her
altogether
and
hindered
her
from
following
the
details
of
her
thoughts
that
had
no
connection
with
what
he
was
saying
flitted
through
her
she
thought
of
her
her
account
of
the
agitation
while
pierre
was
speaking
struck
her
and
various
traits
of
his
sensitive
character
recurred
to
her
and
while
thinking
of
her
nephew
she
thought
also
of
her
own
she
did
not
compare
them
with
but
compared
her
feeling
for
them
with
her
feeling
for
and
felt
with
regret
that
there
was
something
lacking
in
her
feeling
for
young
sometimes
it
seemed
to
her
that
this
difference
arose
from
the
difference
in
their
but
she
felt
herself
to
blame
toward
him
and
promised
in
her
heart
to
do
better
and
to
accomplish
the
this
life
to
love
her
her
little
and
all
her
as
christ
loved
countess
soul
always
strove
toward
the
the
and
the
and
could
therefore
never
be
at
a
stern
expression
of
the
secret
suffering
of
a
soul
burdened
by
the
body
appeared
on
her
nicholas
gazed
at
what
will
become
of
us
if
she
as
i
always
fear
when
her
face
is
like
thought
and
placing
himself
before
the
icon
he
began
to
say
his
evening
chapter
xvi
natasha
and
left
also
began
to
talk
as
only
a
husband
and
wife
can
that
with
extraordinary
clearness
and
understanding
and
expressing
each
thoughts
in
ways
contrary
to
all
rules
of
without
or
and
in
a
quite
peculiar
natasha
was
so
used
to
this
kind
of
talk
with
her
husband
that
for
her
it
was
the
surest
sign
of
something
being
wrong
between
them
if
pierre
followed
a
line
of
logical
when
he
began
proving
or
talking
argumentatively
and
calmly
and
led
on
by
his
began
to
do
the
she
knew
that
they
were
on
the
verge
of
a
from
the
moment
they
were
alone
and
natasha
came
up
to
him
with
open
happy
and
quickly
seizing
his
head
pressed
it
to
her
you
are
all
you
that
moment
this
conversation
contrary
to
all
the
laws
of
logic
and
contrary
to
them
because
quite
different
subjects
were
talked
about
at
one
and
the
same
this
simultaneous
discussion
of
many
topics
did
not
prevent
a
clear
understanding
but
on
the
contrary
was
the
surest
sign
that
they
fully
understood
one
just
as
in
a
dream
when
all
is
and
except
the
feeling
that
guides
the
so
in
this
intercourse
contrary
to
all
laws
of
the
words
themselves
were
not
consecutive
and
clear
but
only
the
feeling
that
prompted
natasha
spoke
to
pierre
about
her
life
and
of
how
she
had
suffered
and
lacked
life
during
his
own
and
of
how
she
was
fonder
than
ever
of
and
how
mary
was
in
every
way
better
than
in
saying
this
natasha
was
sincere
in
acknowledging
but
at
the
same
time
by
saying
it
she
made
a
demand
on
pierre
that
he
all
the
prefer
her
to
mary
and
to
all
other
and
that
especially
after
having
seen
many
women
in
he
should
tell
her
so
answering
told
her
how
intolerable
it
had
been
for
him
to
meet
ladies
at
dinners
and
balls
in
have
quite
lost
the
knack
of
talking
to
he
was
simply
i
was
very
natasha
looked
intently
at
him
and
went
is
so
she
she
understands
it
is
as
if
she
saw
straight
into
their
for
mitya
was
like
his
father
he
pierre
natasha
knew
why
he
mentioned
likeness
to
the
recollection
of
his
dispute
with
his
was
unpleasant
and
he
wanted
to
know
what
natasha
thought
of
has
the
weakness
of
never
agreeing
with
anything
not
generally
but
i
understand
that
you
value
what
opens
up
a
fresh
said
repeating
words
pierre
had
once
the
chief
point
is
that
to
nicholas
ideas
and
discussions
are
an
a
said
he
is
collecting
a
library
and
has
made
it
a
rule
not
to
buy
a
new
book
till
he
has
read
what
he
had
already
and
rousseau
and
he
added
with
a
know
how
much
he
began
to
soften
down
what
he
had
but
natasha
interrupted
him
to
show
that
this
was
you
say
ideas
are
an
amusement
to
and
for
me
nothing
else
is
all
the
time
in
petersburg
i
saw
everyone
as
in
a
when
i
am
taken
up
by
a
all
else
is
mere
so
sorry
i
there
when
you
met
the
said
was
most
pierre
and
went
on
with
what
was
in
his
says
we
ought
not
to
but
i
help
when
i
was
in
petersburg
i
felt
can
say
this
to
that
the
whole
affair
would
go
to
pieces
without
was
pulling
his
own
but
i
succeeded
in
uniting
them
and
then
my
idea
is
so
clear
and
you
i
say
that
we
ought
to
oppose
this
and
we
may
be
what
i
say
you
who
love
the
and
let
there
be
but
one
of
active
prince
sergey
is
a
fine
fellow
and
natasha
would
have
had
no
doubt
as
to
the
greatness
of
but
one
thing
disconcerted
a
man
so
important
and
necessary
to
society
be
also
my
how
did
this
she
wished
to
express
this
doubt
to
who
could
decide
whether
he
is
really
cleverer
than
all
the
she
asked
and
passed
in
review
all
those
whom
pierre
most
judging
by
what
he
had
said
there
was
no
one
he
had
respected
so
highly
as
platon
you
know
what
i
am
thinking
she
platon
would
he
have
approved
of
you
do
you
pierre
was
not
at
all
surprised
at
this
he
understood
his
line
of
he
and
evidently
sincerely
trying
to
imagine
opinion
on
the
would
not
have
yet
perhaps
he
love
you
natasha
suddenly
he
would
not
have
said
after
he
would
have
approved
of
is
our
family
he
was
always
so
anxious
to
find
and
peace
in
and
i
should
have
been
proud
to
let
him
see
there
talk
of
my
but
you
believe
what
a
special
feeling
i
have
for
you
after
a
i
should
natasha
not
i
never
leave
off
loving
and
one
love
but
this
is
something
of
he
did
not
finish
because
their
eyes
meeting
said
the
nonsense
it
natasha
suddenly
and
that
the
greatest
happiness
is
at
on
the
now
is
the
best
of
if
only
you
did
not
go
do
you
remember
how
we
and
it
was
always
my
always
and
what
we
quarreled
even
about
the
same
said
pierre
with
a
say
i
bear
natasha
and
her
eyes
glittered
coldly
and
you
see
she
after
a
and
if
i
had
i
have
recognized
they
were
silent
for
a
do
you
while
you
were
talking
in
the
study
i
was
looking
at
natasha
evidently
anxious
to
disperse
the
cloud
that
had
come
over
are
as
like
him
as
two
the
meant
her
little
time
to
go
to
the
but
sorry
to
leave
they
were
silent
for
a
few
then
suddenly
turning
to
one
another
at
the
same
time
they
both
began
to
pierre
began
with
satisfaction
and
natasha
with
a
happy
having
interrupted
one
another
they
both
stopped
to
let
the
other
what
did
you
go
go
you
go
i
was
talking
said
pierre
finished
what
he
had
it
was
the
sequel
to
his
complacent
reflections
on
his
success
in
at
that
moment
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
chosen
to
give
a
new
direction
to
the
whole
of
russian
society
and
to
the
whole
only
wished
to
say
that
ideas
that
have
great
results
are
always
simple
my
whole
idea
is
that
if
vicious
people
are
united
and
constitute
a
then
honest
folk
must
do
the
now
simple
what
were
you
going
to
only
all
the
only
a
said
smilingly
still
more
only
wanted
to
tell
you
about
today
nurse
was
coming
to
take
him
from
and
he
shut
his
and
clung
to
sure
he
thought
he
was
awfully
now
and
she
left
the
meanwhile
downstairs
in
young
nicholas
bedroom
a
little
lamp
was
burning
as
boy
was
afraid
of
the
dark
and
they
could
not
cure
him
of
dessalles
slept
propped
up
on
four
pillows
and
his
roman
nose
emitted
sounds
of
rhythmic
little
who
had
just
waked
up
in
a
cold
sat
up
in
bed
and
gazed
before
him
with
he
had
awaked
from
a
terrible
he
had
dreamed
that
he
and
uncle
wearing
helmets
such
as
were
depicted
in
his
were
leading
a
huge
the
army
was
made
up
of
white
slanting
lines
that
filled
the
air
like
the
cobwebs
that
float
about
in
autumn
and
which
dessalles
called
les
fils
de
la
in
front
was
which
was
similar
to
those
threads
but
rather
he
and
pierre
were
borne
along
lightly
and
nearer
and
nearer
to

even
of

the
ancient
historians
all
employed
one
and
the

method
to
describe
and
seize
the
apparently
life
of
a
they
described
the
activity
of
individuals
who
ruled

regarded
the
activity
of
those

how
did
individuals
make
nations
act
as
they
wished
and
by
what
was

will
of
these
individuals

the
ancients
met
by
recognizing
a
divinity
which
subjected
the
nations
to

and
guided
the
will
of
that

so
as
to
accomplish
ends

these
questions
were
solved
by

in
the

in

both
these
it
would
seem

having
rejected
the
belief
of
the
ancients
in
subjection
to
the
deity
and
in
a
predetermined
aim
toward
which
nations
are
modern

should
study
not
the
manifestations
of
power
but
the
causes
that
produce

modern

has
not

in

rejected
the

endowed

of

portion
of

has
rejected
the
beliefs
of
the

without
replacing

after

had
apparently
rejected
the
divine
authority
of
the

and
the
of

to
reach
the

conclusion
by
another
that
to
recognize
nations
guided
by
individual
and
the
existence
of
a
known
aim
to
which
these
nations
and

at

are
at

of
the
works
of
all
the
modern
historians
from
gibbon
to
despite
their
seeming
disagreements
and
the
apparent
novelty
of
their
lie
those
two
unavoidable
in
the
first
place
the
historian
describes
the
activity
of
individuals
who
in
his
opinion
have
directed
humanity
historian
considers
only
and
ministers
as
being
such
while
another
includes
also
learned
and
it
is
assumed
that
the
goal
toward
which
humanity
is
being
led
is
known
to
the
to
one
of
them
this
goal
is
the
greatness
of
the
or
french
to
another
it
is
and
a
certain
kind
of
civilization
of
a
small
corner
of
the
world
called
in
1789
a
ferment
arises
in
it
and
is
expressed
by
a
movement
of
peoples
from
west
to
several
times
it
moves
eastward
and
collides
with
a
countermovement
from
the
east
in
1812
it
reaches
its
extreme
and
with
remarkable
a
countermovement
occurs
from
east
to
attracting
to
as
the
first
movement
had
the
nations
of
middle
the
counter
movement
reaches
the
starting
point
of
the
first
movement
in
the
during
that
period
an
immense
number
of
fields
were
left
houses
were
trade
changed
its
millions
of
men
were
or
were
and
millions
of
christian
men
professing
the
law
of
love
of
their
fellows
slew
one
what
does
all
this
why
did
it
what
made
those
people
burn
houses
and
slay
their
fellow
what
were
the
causes
of
these
what
force
made
men
act
these
are
the
and
most
legitimate
questions
humanity
asks
itself
when
it
encounters
the
monuments
and
tradition
of
that
for
a
reply
to
these
questions
the
common
sense
of
mankind
turns
to
the
science
of
whose
aim
is
to
enable
nations
and
humanity
to
know
if
history
had
retained
the
conception
of
the
ancients
it
would
have
said
that
to
reward
or
punish
his
gave
napoleon
power
and
directed
his
will
to
the
fulfillment
of
the
divine
and
that
reply
would
have
been
clear
and
one
might
believe
or
disbelieve
in
the
divine
significance
of
but
for
anyone
believing
in
it
there
would
have
been
nothing
unintelligible
in
the
history
of
that
nor
would
there
have
been
any
but
modern
history
cannot
give
that
science
does
not
admit
the
conception
of
the
ancients
as
to
the
direct
participation
of
the
deity
in
human
and
therefore
history
ought
to
give
other
modern
history
replying
to
these
questions
you
want
to
know
what
this
movement
what
caused
and
what
force
produced
these
then
xiv
was
a
very
proud
and
he
had
such
and
such
mistresses
and
such
and
such
ministers
and
he
ruled
france
his
descendants
were
weak
men
and
they
too
ruled
france
and
they
had
such
and
such
favorites
and
such
and
such
certain
men
wrote
some
books
at
that
at
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
there
were
a
couple
of
dozen
men
in
paris
who
began
to
talk
about
all
men
being
free
and
this
caused
people
all
over
france
to
begin
to
slash
at
and
drown
one
they
killed
the
king
and
many
other
at
that
time
there
was
in
france
a
man
of
he
conquered
everybody
he
killed
many
people
because
he
was
a
great
and
for
some
reason
he
went
to
kill
and
killed
them
so
well
and
was
so
cunning
and
wise
that
when
he
returned
to
france
he
ordered
everybody
to
obey
and
they
all
obeyed
having
become
an
emperor
he
again
went
out
to
kill
people
in
and
and
there
too
he
killed
a
great
in
russia
there
was
an
who
decided
to
restore
order
in
europe
and
therefore
fought
against
in
1807
he
suddenly
made
friends
with
but
in
1811
they
again
quarreled
and
again
began
killing
many
napoleon
led
six
hundred
thousand
men
into
russia
and
captured
then
he
suddenly
ran
away
from
and
the
emperor
helped
by
the
advice
of
stein
and
united
europe
to
arm
against
the
disturber
of
its
all
allies
suddenly
became
his
enemies
and
their
forces
advanced
against
the
fresh
forces
he
the
allies
defeated
entered
forced
napoleon
to
and
sent
him
to
the
island
of
not
depriving
him
of
the
title
of
emperor
and
showing
him
every
though
five
years
before
and
one
year
later
they
all
regarded
him
as
an
outlaw
and
a
then
louis
who
till
then
had
been
the
laughingstock
both
of
the
french
and
the
began
to
and
shedding
tears
before
his
old
renounced
the
throne
and
went
into
then
the
skillful
statesmen
and
diplomatists
who
managed
to
sit
down
in
a
particular
chair
before
anyone
else
and
thereby
extended
the
frontiers
of
talked
in
vienna
and
by
these
conversations
made
the
nations
happy
or
suddenly
the
diplomatists
and
monarchs
nearly
quarreled
and
were
on
the
point
of
again
ordering
their
armies
to
kill
one
but
just
then
napoleon
arrived
in
france
with
a
and
the
who
had
been
hating
immediately
all
submitted
to
but
the
allied
monarchs
were
angry
at
this
and
went
to
fight
the
french
once
and
they
defeated
the
genius
napoleon
suddenly
recognizing
him
as
a
sent
him
to
the
island
of
and
the
separated
from
the
beloved
france
so
dear
to
his
died
a
lingering
death
on
that
rock
and
bequeathed
his
great
deeds
to
but
in
europe
a
reaction
occurred
and
the
sovereigns
once
again
all
began
to
oppress
their
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
think
that
this
is
caricature
of
the
historical
on
the
contrary
it
is
a
very
mild
expression
of
the
contradictory
not
meeting
the
which
all
the
historians
from
the
compilers
of
memoirs
and
the
histories
of
separate
states
to
the
writers
of
general
histories
and
the
new
histories
of
the
culture
of
that
the
strangeness
and
absurdity
of
these
replies
arise
from
the
fact
that
modern
like
a
deaf
answers
questions
no
one
has
if
the
purpose
of
history
be
to
give
a
description
of
the
movement
of
humanity
and
of
the
the
first
the
absence
of
a
reply
to
which
all
the
rest
will
be
what
is
the
power
that
moves
to
modern
history
laboriously
replies
either
that
napoleon
was
a
great
or
that
louis
xiv
was
very
or
that
certain
writers
wrote
certain
all
that
may
be
so
and
mankind
is
ready
to
agree
with
but
it
is
not
what
was
all
that
would
be
interesting
if
we
recognized
a
divine
power
based
on
itself
and
always
consistently
directing
its
nations
through
and
but
we
do
not
acknowledge
such
a
and
therefore
before
speaking
about
and
we
ought
to
be
shown
the
connection
existing
between
these
men
and
the
movement
of
the
if
instead
of
a
divine
power
some
other
force
has
it
should
be
explained
in
what
this
new
force
for
the
whole
interest
of
history
lies
precisely
in
that
history
seems
to
assume
that
this
force
is
and
known
to
but
in
spite
of
every
desire
to
regard
it
as
anyone
reading
many
historical
works
cannot
help
doubting
whether
this
new
so
variously
understood
by
the
historians
is
really
quite
well
known
to
chapter
ii
what
force
moves
the
biographical
historians
and
historians
of
separate
nations
understand
this
force
as
a
power
inherent
in
heroes
and
in
their
narration
events
occur
solely
by
the
will
of
a
and
or
in
general
of
the
persons
they
the
answers
given
by
this
kind
of
historian
to
the
question
of
what
force
causes
events
to
happen
are
satisfactory
only
as
long
as
there
is
but
one
historian
to
each
as
soon
as
historians
of
different
nationalities
and
tendencies
begin
to
describe
the
same
the
replies
they
give
immediately
lose
all
for
this
force
is
understood
by
them
all
not
only
differently
but
often
in
quite
contradictory
one
historian
says
that
an
event
was
produced
by
another
that
it
was
produced
by
a
third
that
it
was
due
to
the
power
of
some
other
besides
historians
of
that
kind
contradict
each
other
even
in
their
statement
as
to
the
force
on
which
the
authority
of
some
particular
person
was
a
says
that
power
was
based
on
his
virtue
and
a
says
it
was
based
on
his
trickery
and
deception
of
the
so
the
historians
of
this
by
mutually
destroying
one
destroy
the
understanding
of
the
force
which
produces
and
furnish
no
reply
to
essential
writers
of
universal
history
who
deal
with
all
the
nations
seem
to
recognize
how
erroneous
is
the
specialist
view
of
the
force
which
produces
they
do
not
recognize
it
as
a
power
inherent
in
heroes
and
but
as
the
resultant
of
a
multiplicity
of
variously
directed
in
describing
a
war
or
the
subjugation
of
a
a
general
historian
looks
for
the
cause
of
the
event
not
in
the
power
of
one
but
in
the
interaction
of
many
persons
connected
with
the
according
to
this
view
the
power
of
historical
represented
as
the
product
of
many
can
no
it
would
be
regarded
as
a
force
that
itself
produces
yet
in
most
cases
universal
historians
still
employ
the
conception
of
power
as
a
force
that
itself
produces
and
treat
it
as
their
in
their
an
historic
character
is
first
the
product
of
his
and
his
power
only
the
resultant
of
various
and
then
his
power
is
itself
a
force
producing
and
for
at
one
time
prove
napoleon
to
be
a
product
of
the
of
the
ideas
of
1789
and
so
and
at
another
plainly
say
that
the
campaign
of
1812
and
other
things
they
do
not
like
were
simply
the
product
of
misdirected
and
that
the
very
ideas
of
1789
were
arrested
in
their
development
by
the
ideas
of
the
revolution
and
the
general
temper
of
the
age
produced
but
power
suppressed
the
ideas
of
the
revolution
and
the
general
temper
of
the
this
curious
contradiction
is
not
not
only
does
it
occur
at
every
but
the
universal
accounts
are
all
made
up
of
a
chain
of
such
this
contradiction
occurs
because
after
entering
the
field
of
analysis
the
universal
historians
stop
to
find
component
forces
equal
to
the
composite
or
resultant
the
sum
of
the
components
must
equal
the
this
condition
is
never
observed
by
the
universal
and
so
to
explain
the
resultant
forces
they
are
obliged
to
in
addition
to
the
insufficient
another
unexplained
force
affecting
the
resultant
specialist
historians
describing
the
campaign
of
1813
or
the
restoration
of
the
bourbons
plainly
assert
that
these
events
were
produced
by
the
will
of
but
the
universal
historian
refuting
this
opinion
of
the
specialist
tries
to
prove
that
the
campaign
of
1813
and
the
restoration
of
the
bourbons
were
due
to
other
things
beside
as
the
activity
of
madame
de
and
the
historian
evidently
decomposes
power
into
the
and
the
the
sum
of
the
that
the
interactions
of
madame
de
and
the
evidently
does
not
equal
the
namely
the
phenomenon
of
millions
of
frenchmen
submitting
to
the
that
madame
de
and
others
spoke
certain
words
to
one
another
only
affected
their
mutual
relations
but
does
not
account
for
the
submission
of
and
therefore
to
explain
how
from
these
relations
of
theirs
the
submission
of
millions
of
people
how
component
forces
equal
to
one
a
gave
a
resultant
equal
to
a
thousand
times
historian
is
again
obliged
to
fall
back
on
force
he
had
to
recognize
it
as
the
resultant
of
the
that
he
has
to
admit
an
unexplained
force
acting
on
the
and
that
is
just
what
the
universal
historians
and
consequently
they
not
only
contradict
the
specialist
historians
but
contradict
peasants
having
no
clear
idea
of
the
cause
of
according
to
whether
they
want
rain
or
fine
wind
has
blown
the
clouds
wind
has
brought
up
the
and
in
the
same
way
the
universal
historians
when
it
pleases
them
and
fits
in
with
their
say
that
power
is
the
result
of
and
when
they
want
to
prove
something
say
that
power
produces
a
third
class
of
historians
of
following
the
path
laid
down
by
the
universal
historians
who
sometimes
accept
writers
and
ladies
as
forces
producing
take
that
force
to
be
something
quite
they
see
it
in
what
is
called
mental
the
historians
of
culture
are
quite
consistent
in
regard
to
their
the
writers
of
universal
for
if
historical
events
may
be
explained
by
the
fact
that
certain
persons
treated
one
another
in
such
and
such
why
not
explain
them
by
the
fact
that
such
and
such
people
wrote
such
and
such
of
the
immense
number
of
indications
accompanying

historians
select
the
indication
of
intellectual
activity
and
say
that
this
indication
is
the
but
despite
their
endeavors
to
prove
that
the
cause
of
events
lies
in
intellectual
only
by
a
great
stretch
can
one
admit
that
there
is
any
connection
between
intellectual
activity
and
the
movement
of
and
in
no
case
can
one
admit
that
intellectual
activity
controls
for
that
view
is
not
confirmed
by
such
facts
as
the
very
cruel
murders
of
the
french
revolution
resulting
from
the
doctrine
of
the
equality
of
or
the
very
cruel
wars
and
executions
resulting
from
the
preaching
of

even
admitting
as
correct

the
cunningly
devised
arguments
with
which
these
histories
are

nations
are
governed
by
some
undefined
force

essential
question

the

of

and
to

of

and
other

by
the

the
connection
of
which
with
the
masses
needs
it
is
possible
to
understand
that
napoleon
had
power
and
so
events
with
some
effort
one
may
even
conceive
that
napoleon
together
with
other
influences
was
the
cause
of
an
but
how
a
le
contrat
had
the
effect
of
making
frenchmen
begin
to
drown
one
another
cannot
be
understood
without
an
explanation
of
the
causal
nexus
of
this
new
force
with
the
undoubtedly
some
relation
exists
between
all
who
live
and
so
it
is
possible
to
find
some
connection
between
the
intellectual
activity
of
men
and
their
historical
just
as
such
a
connection
may
be
found
between
the
movements
of
humanity
and
or
anything
else
you
but
why
intellectual
activity
is
considered
by
the
historians
of
culture
to
be
the
cause
or
expression
of
the
whole
historical
movement
is
hard
to
only
the
following
considerations
can
have
led
the
historians
to
such
a
that
history
is
written
by
learned
and
so
it
is
natural
and
agreeable
for
them
to
think
that
the
activity
of
their
class
supplies
the
basis
of
the
movement
of
all
just
as
a
similar
belief
is
natural
and
agreeable
to
and
soldiers
they
do
not
express
that
is
merely
because
traders
and
soldiers
do
not
write
and
that
spiritual
are
all
indefinite
conceptions
under
whose
banner
it
is
very
easy
to
use
words
having
a
still
less
definite
and
which
can
therefore
be
readily
introduced
into
any
but
not
to
speak
of
the
intrinsic
quality
of
histories
of
this
kind
may
possibly
even
be
of
use
to
someone
for
the
histories
of
to
which
all
general
histories
tend
more
and
more
to
are
significant
from
the
fact
that
after
seriously
and
minutely
examining
various
and
political
doctrines
as
causes
of
as
soon
as
they
have
to
describe
an
actual
historic
event
such
as
the
campaign
of
1812
for
they
involuntarily
describe
it
as
resulting
from
an
exercise
of
say
plainly
that
that
was
the
result
of
speaking
the
historians
of
culture
involuntarily
contradict
and
show
that
the
new
force
they
have
devised
does
not
account
for
what
happens
in
and
that
history
can
only
be
explained
by
introducing
a
power
which
they
apparently
do
not

asserts
that
the
cause
of
its

lies
in
the
smoke
which
the
wind
carries

he
has
devised
a
complete
to
refute

someone
would
have
to
prove
to
him
that
there
is
no
or
another
peasant
would
have
to
explain
to
him
that
it
is
not
the
devil
but
a
who
moves
the
only
as
a
result
of
the
will
they
see
that
they
are
both
but
the
man
who
says
that
the
movement
of
the
wheels
is
the
cause
refutes
for
having
once
begun
to
analyze
he
ought
to
go
on
and
explain
further
why
the
wheels
go
and
till
he
has
reached
the
ultimate
cause
of
the
movement
of
the
locomotive
in
the
pressure
of
steam
in
the
he
has
no
right
to
stop
in
his
search
for
the
the
man
who
explains
the
movement
of
the
locomotive
by
the
smoke
that
is
carried
back
has
noticed
that
the
wheels
do
not
supply
an
explanation
and
has
taken
the
first
sign
that
occurs
to
him
and
in
his
turn
has
offered
that
as
an
the
only
conception
that
can
explain
the
movement
of
the
locomotive
is
that
of
a
force
commensurate
with
the
movement
the
only
conception
that
can
explain
the
movement
of
the
peoples
is
that
of
some
force
commensurate
with
the
whole
movement
of
the
yet
to
supply
this
conception
various
historians
take
forces
of
different
all
of
which
are
incommensurate
with
the
movement
some
see
it
as
a
force
directly
inherent
in
as
the
peasant
sees
the
devil
in
the
others
as
a
force
resulting
from
several
other
like
the
movement
of
the
others
again
as
an
intellectual
like
the
smoke
that
is
blown
so
long
as
histories
are
written
of
separate
whether
or
and
not
the
histories
of
absolutely
all
those
who
take
part
in
an
it
is
quite
impossible
to
describe
the
movement
of
humanity
without
the
conception
of
a
force
compelling
men
to
direct
their
activity
toward
a
certain
and
the
only
such
conception
known
to
historians
is
that
of
this
conception
is
the
one
handle
by
means
of
which
the
material
of
as
at
present
can
be
dealt
and
anyone
who
breaks
that
handle
as
buckle
without
finding
some
other
method
of
treating
historical
merely
deprives
himself
of
the
one
possible
way
of
dealing
with
the
necessity
of
the
conception
of
power
as
an
explanation
of
historical
events
is
best
demonstrated
by
the
universal
historians
and
historians
of
culture
for
they
professedly
reject
that
conception
but
inevitably
have
recourse
to
it
at
every
in
dealing
with
the
science
of
history
up
to
now
is
like
money
in
money
and
the
biographies
and
special
national
histories
are
like
paper
they
can
be
used
and
can
circulate
and
fulfill
their
purpose
without
harm
to
anyone
and
even
as
long
as
no
one
asks
what
is
the
security
behind
you
need
only
forget
to
ask
how
the
will
of
heroes
produces
and
such
histories
as
will
be
interesting
and
instructive
and
may
perhaps
even
possess
a
tinge
of
but
just
as
doubts
of
the
real
value
of
paper
money
arise
either
being
easy
to
too
much
of
it
gets
made
or
because
people
try
to
exchange
it
for
so
also
doubts
concerning
the
real
value
of
such
histories
arise
either
because
too
many
of
them
are
written
or
because
in
his
simplicity
of
heart
someone
by
what
force
did
napoleon
do
wants
to
exchange
the
current
paper
money
for
the
real
gold
of
actual
the
writers
of
universal
histories
and
of
the
history
of
culture
are
like
people
recognizing
the
defects
of
paper
decide
to
substitute
for
it
money
made
of
metal
that
has
not
the
specific
gravity
of
it
may
indeed
make
jingling
but
will
do
no
more
than
paper
money
may
deceive
the
but
nobody
is
deceived
by
tokens
of
base
metal
that
have
no
value
but
merely
as
gold
is
gold
only
if
it
is
serviceable
not
merely
for
exchange
but
also
for
so
universal
historians
will
be
valuable
only
when
they
can
reply
to
essential
what
is
the
universal
historians
give
contradictory
replies
to
that
while
the
historians
of
culture
evade
it
and
answer
something
quite
and
as
counters
of
imitation
gold
can
be
used
only
among
a
group
of
people
who
agree
to
accept
them
as
or
among
those
who
do
not
know
the
nature
of
so
universal
historians
and
historians
of
not
answering
essential
serve
as
currency
for
some
purposes
of
their
only
in
universities
and
among
the
mass
of
readers
who
have
a
taste
for
what
they
call
chapter
iv
having
abandoned
the
conception
of
the
ancients
as
to
the
divine
subjection
of
the
will
of
a
nation
to
some
chosen
man
and
the
subjection
of
that
will
to
the
history
cannot
without
contradictions
take
a
single
step
till
it
has
chosen
one
of
two
either
a
return
to
the
former
belief
in
the
direct
intervention
of
the
deity
in
human
affairs
or
a
definite
explanation
of
the
meaning
of
the
force
producing
historical
events
and
termed
a
return
to
the
first
is
the
belief
has
been
and
so
it
is
essential
to
explain
what
is
meant
by
napoleon
ordered
an
army
to
be
raised
and
go
to
we
are
so
accustomed
to
that
idea
and
have
become
so
used
to
it
that
the
why
did
six
hundred
thousand
men
go
to
fight
when
napoleon
uttered
certain
seems
to
us
he
had
the
power
and
so
what
he
ordered
was
this
reply
is
quite
satisfactory
if
we
believe
that
the
power
was
given
him
by
but
as
soon
as
we
do
not
admit
it
becomes
essential
to
determine
what
is
this
power
of
one
man
over
it
cannot
be
the
direct
physical
power
of
a
strong
man
over
a
weak
a
domination
based
on
the
application
or
threat
of
physical
like
the
power
of
nor
can
it
be
based
on
the
effect
of
moral
as
in
their
simplicity
some
historians
think
who
say
that
the
leading
figures
in
history
are
that
men
gifted
with
a
special
strength
of
soul
and
mind
called
this
power
cannot
be
based
on
the
predominance
of
moral
not
to
mention
heroes
such
as
napoleon
about
whose
moral
qualities
opinions
differ
history
shows
us
that
neither
a
louis
xi
nor
a
who
ruled
over
millions
of
had
any
particular
moral
but
on
the
contrary
were
generally
morally
weaker
than
any
of
the
millions
they
ruled
if
the
source
of
power
lies
neither
in
the
physical
nor
in
the
moral
qualities
of
him
who
possesses
it
must
evidently
be
looked
for
the
relation
to
the
people
of
the
man
who
wields
the
and
that
is
how
power
is
understood
by
the
science
of
that
exchange
bank
of
history
which
offers
to
exchange
understanding
of
power
for
true
power
is
the
collective
will
of
the
people
by
expressed
or
tacit
to
their
chosen
in
the
domain

which

of
discussions
of
how
a
state
and
power
might
be
arranged
were
it
possible
for
all
that
to
be
it
is
all
very
but
when
applied
to
history
that
definition
of
power
needs
the
science
of
jurisprudence
regards
the
state
and
power
as
the
ancients
regarded
as
something
existing
but
for
the
state
and
power
are
merely
just
as
for
modern
physics
fire
is
not
an
element
but
a
from
this
fundamental
difference
between
the
view
held
by
history
and
that
held
by
it
follows
that
jurisprudence
can
tell
minutely
how
in
its
opinion
power
should
be
constituted
and
what
existing
immutably
outside
but
to
questions
about
the
meaning
of
the
mutations
of
power
in

it
can
answer
if

these
questions
three
answers
are
either
to
assume
that
the
will
of
the
people
is
always
unconditionally
transferred
to
the
ruler
or
rulers
they
have
and
that
therefore
every
emergence
of
a
new
every
struggle
against
the
power
once
should
be
absolutely
regarded
as
an
infringement
of
the
real
or
that
the
will
of
the
people
is
transferred
to
the
rulers
under
definite
and
known
and
to
show
that
all
and
even
destructions
of
power
result
from
a
nonobservance
by
the
rulers
of
the
conditions
under
which
their
power
was
entrusted
to
or
that
the
will
of
the
people
is
delegated
to
the
rulers
but
that
the
conditions
are
unknown
and
and
that
the
appearance
of
several
their
struggles
and
their
result
solely
from
the
greater
or
lesser
fulfillment
by
the
rulers
of
these
unknown
conditions
on
which
the
will
of
the
people
is
transferred
from
some
people
to
and
these
are
the
three
ways
in
which
the
historians
do
explain
the
relation
of
the
people
to
their
some
biographical
and
specialist
historians
already
referred
their
simplicity
failing
to
understand
the
question
of
the
meaning
of
seem
to
consider
that
the
collective
will
of
the
people
is
unconditionally
transferred
to
historical
and
therefore
when
describing
some
single
state
they
assume
that
particular
power
to
be
the
one
absolute
and
real
and
that
any
other
force
opposing
this
is
not
a
power
but
a
violation
of
their
suitable
for
primitive
and
peaceful
periods
of
has
the
application
to
complex
and
stormy
periods
in
the
life
of
nations
during
which
various
powers
arise
simultaneously
and
struggle
with
one
a
legitimist
historian
will
prove
that
the
national
the
and
bonaparte
were
mere
infringers
of
the
true
while
a
republican
and
a
bonapartist
will
the
one
that
the
convention
and
the
other
that
the
empire
was
the
real
and
that
all
the
others
were
violations
of
evidently
the
explanations
furnished
by
these
historians
being
mutually
contradictory
can
only
satisfy
young
recognizing
the
falsity
of
this
view
of
another
set
of
historians
say
that
power
rests
on
a
conditional
delegation
of
the
will
of
the
people
to
their
and
that
historical
leaders
have
power
only
conditionally
on
carrying
out
the
program
that
the
will
of
the
people
has
by
tacit
agreement
prescribed
to
but
what
this
program
consists
in
these
historians
do
not

if
they
do
they
continually
contradict

to
his
view
of
what
constitutes

for

of

some
other

not
to
mention
the
contradictions
as
to
the
nature
of
this
even
admitting
that
some
one
general
program
of
these
conditions
facts
of
history
almost
always
contradict
that

the
conditions
under

and

is
it

reply
that

to

reacted
on

why
did
it
not
react
on
louis
xiv
or
on
louis
should
it
react
just
on
louis

what
is
the
time
limit
for
such
to
these
questions
there
are
and
can
be
no
equally
little
does
this
view
explain
why
for
several
centuries
the
collective
will
is
not
withdrawn
from
certain
rulers
and
their
and
then
suddenly
during
a
period
of
fifty
years
is
transferred
to

to
charles
to

to

and
to
napoleon
when
explaining
these
rapid
transfers
of
the
will
from
one
individual
to
especially
in
view
of
international
and
the
historians
are
obliged
to
admit
that
some
of
these
transfers
are
not
normal
delegations
of
the
will
but
are
accidents
dependent
on
on
on
or
on
the
weakness
of
a
a
or
a
party
so
that
the
greater
part
of
the
events
of
and
presented
by
these
historians
not
as
the
results
of
free
transferences
of
the
but
as
results
of
the
will
of
one
or
more
that
once
as
usurpations
of
and
so
these
historians
also
see
and
admit
historical
events
which
are
exceptions
to
the
these
historians
resemble
a
botanist
having
noticed
that
some
plants
grow
from
seeds
producing
two
should
insist
that
all
that
grows
does
so
by
sprouting
into
two
and
that
the
the
and
even
the
which
blossom
into
full
growth
and
no
longer
resemble
two
are
deviations
from
the
historians
of
the
third
class
assume
that
the
will
of
the
people
is
transferred
to
historic
personages
but
that
the
conditions
are
unknown

that
historical
personages
have
power
only
because
they
fulfill
the
will
of
the
people
which
has
been
delegated
to
but
in
that
if
the
force
that
moves
nations
lies
not
in
the
historic
leaders
but
in
the
nations
what
significance
have
those
the
these
historians
tell
express
the
will
of
the
the
activity
of
the
leaders
represents
the
activity
of
the
but
in
that
case
the
question
arises
whether
all
the
activity
of
the
leaders
serves
as
an
expression
of
the
will
or
only
some
part
of
if
the
whole
activity
of
the
leaders
serves
as
the
expression
of
the
as
some
historians
then
all
the
details
of
the
court
scandals
contained
in
the
biographies
of
a
napoleon
or
a
catherine
serve
to
express
the
life
of
the
which
is
evident
but
if
it
is
only
some
particular
side
of
the
activity
of
an
historical
leader
which
serves
to
express
the
as
other
historians
then
to
determine
which
side
of
the
activity
of
a
leader
expresses
the
we
have
first
of
all
to
know
in
what
the
life
met
by
this
difficulty
historians
of
that
class
devise
some
most
and
general
abstraction
which
can
cover
all
conceivable
and
declare
this
abstraction
to
be
the
aim
of
the
most
usual
generalizations
adopted
by
almost
all
the
historians
and
postulating
some
generalization
as
the
goal
of
the
movement
of
the
historians
study
the
men
of
whom
the
greatest
number
of
monuments
have
and
to
the
extent
to
which
in
their
opinion
these
persons
have
promoted
or
hindered
that
but
as
it
is
in
no
way
proved
that
the
aim
of
humanity
does
consist
in
or
and
as
the
connection
of
the
people
with
the
rulers
and
enlighteners
of
humanity
is
only
based
on
the
arbitrary
assumption
that
the
collective
will
of
the
people
is
always
transferred
to
the
men
whom
we
have
it
happens
that
the
activity
of
the
millions
who
burn
abandon
and
destroy
one
another
never
is
expressed
in
the
account
of
the
activity
of
some
dozen
people
who
did
not
burn
practice
or
slay
their
fellow
history
proves
this
at
every
is
the
ferment
of
the
peoples
of
the
west
at
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
their
drive
eastward
explained
by
the
activity
of
louis
and
their
mistresses
and
and
by
the
lives
of
and
is
the
movement
of
the
russian
people
eastward
to
kazan
and
siberia
expressed
by
details
of
the
morbid
character
of
ivan
the
terrible
and
by
his
correspondence
with

the
movement
of
the
peoples
at
the
time
of
the
crusades
explained
by
the
life
and
activity
of
the
godfreys
and
the
and
their
for
us
that
movement
of
the
peoples
from
west
to
without
with
a
crowd
of
and
with
peter
the
remains
and
yet
more
incomprehensible
is
the
cessation
of
that
movement
when
a
rational
and
sacred
aim
for
the
deliverance
of
been
clearly
defined
by
historic
and
knights
incited
the
peoples
to
free
the
holy
but
the
people
did
not
for
the
unknown
cause
which
had
previously
impelled
them
to
go
no
longer
the
history
of
the
godfreys
and
the
minnesingers
can
evidently
not
cover
the
life
of
the
and
the
history
of
the
godfreys

the

has
remained
the
history
of
godfreys

but
the
history
of
the
life
of
the

and
their
impulses
has
remained
still
less
does
the
history
of
authors
and
reformers
explain
to
us
the
life
of
the
the
history
of
culture
explains
to
us
the
impulses
and
conditions
of
life
and
thought
of
a
writer
or
a
we
learn
that
luther
had
a
hot
temper
and
said
such
and
such
we
learn
that
rousseau
was
suspicious
and
wrote
such
and
such
but
we
do
not
learn
why
after
the
reformation
the
peoples
massacred
one
nor
why
during
the
french
revolution
they
guillotined
one
if
we
unite
both
these
kinds
of
as
is
done
by
the
newest
we
shall
have
the
history
of
monarchs
and
but
not
the
history
of
the
life
of
the
chapter
v
the
life
of
the
nations
is
not
contained
in
the
lives
of
a
few
for
the
connection
between
those
men
and
the
nations
has
not
been
the
theory
that
this
connection
is
based
on
the
transference
of
the
collective
will
of
a
people
to
certain
historical
personages
is
an
hypothesis
unconfirmed
by
the
experience
of
the
theory
of
the
transference
of
the
collective
will
of
the
people
to
historic
persons
may
perhaps
explain
much
in
the
domain
of
jurisprudence
and
be
essential
for
its
but
in
its
application
to
as
soon
as
or
civil
wars
as
soon
as
history
theory
explains
the
theory
seems
irrefutable
just
because
the
act
of
transference
of
the
will
cannot
be
for
it
never
whatever
happens
and
whoever
may
stand
at
the
head
of
the
theory
can
always
say
that
such
and
such
a
person
took
the
lead
because
the
collective
will
was
transferred
to
the
replies
this
theory
gives
to
historical
questions
are
like
the
replies
of
a
man
watching
the
movements
of
a
herd
of
cattle
and
paying
no
attention
to
the
varying
quality
of
the
pasturage
in
different
parts
of
the
or
to
the
driving
of
the
should
attribute
the
direction
the
herd
takes
to
what
animal
happens
to
be
at
its
herd
goes
in
that
direction
because
the
animal
in
front
leads
it
and
the
collective
will
of
all
the
other
animals
is
vested
in
that
this
is
what
historians
of
the
first
class
who
assume
the
unconditional
transference
of
the
the
animals
leading
the
herd
this
happens
because
the
collective
will
of
all
the
animals
is
transferred
from
one
leader
to
according
to
whether
the
animal
is
or
is
not
leading
them
in
the
direction
selected
by
the
whole
such
is
the
reply
historians
who
assume
that
the
collective
will
of
the
people
is
delegated
to
rulers
under
conditions
which
they
regard
as
this
method
of
observation
it
often
happens
that
the
influenced
by
the
direction
he
himself
regards
those
as
leaders
owing
to
the
change
of
are
no
longer
in
but
on
one
or
even
in
the
the
animals
in
front
are
continually
changing
and
the
direction
of
the
whole
herd
is
constantly
this
is
because
in
order
to
follow
a
given
direction
the
animals
transfer
their
will
to
the
animals
that
have
attracted
our
and
to
study
the
movements
of
the
herd
we
must
watch
the
movements
of
all
the
prominent
animals
moving
on
all
sides
of
the
so
say
the
third
class
of
historians
who
regard
all
historical
from
monarchs
to
as
the
expression
of
their
the
theory
of
the
transference
of
the
will
of
the
people
to
historic
persons
is
merely
a
restatement
of
the
question
in
other
what
causes
historical
what
is
power
is
the
collective
will
of
the
people
transferred
to
one
under
what
condition
is
the
will
of
the
people
delegated
to
one
on
condition
that
that
person
expresses
the
will
of
the
whole
that
power
is
in
other
power
is
a
word
the
meaning
of
which
we
do
not
if
the
realm
of
human
knowledge
were
confined
to
abstract
then
having
subjected
to
criticism
the
explanation
of
that
juridical
science
gives
humanity
would
conclude
that
power
is
merely
a
word
and
has
no
real
but
to
understand
phenomena
man
besides
abstract
experience
by
which
he
verifies
his
and
experience
tells
us
that
power
is
not
merely
a
word
but
an
actually
existing
not
to
speak
of
the
fact
that
no
description
of
the
collective
activity
of
men
can
do
without
the
conception
of
the
existence
of
power
is
proved
both
by
history
and
by
observing
contemporary
whenever
an
event
occurs
a
man
appears
or
men
by
whose
will
the
event
seems
to
have
taken
napoleon
iii
issues
a
decree
and
the
french
go
to
the
king
of
prussia
and
bismarck
issue
decrees
and
an
army
enters
napoleon
i
issues
a
decree
and
an
army
enters
alexander
i
gives
a
command
and
the
french
submit
to
the
experience
shows
us
that
whatever
event
occurs
it
is
always
related
to
the
will
of
one
or
of
several
men
who
have
decreed
the
in
accord
with
the
old
habit
of
acknowledging
divine
intervention
in
human
want
to
see
the
cause
of
events
in
the
expression
of
the
will
of
someone
endowed
with
but
that
supposition
is
not
confirmed
either
by
reason
or
by
on
the
one
side
reflection
shows
that
the
expression
of
a
his
only
part
of
the
general
activity
expressed
in
an
as
for
instance
in
a
war
or
a
and
so
without
assuming
an
supernatural
cannot
admit
that
words
can
be
the
immediate
cause
of
the
movements
of
millions
of
on
the
other
even
if
we
admitted
that
words
could
be
the
cause
of
history
shows
that
the
expression
of
the
will
of
historical
personages
does
not
in
most
cases
produce
any
that
is
to
their
commands
are
often
not
and
sometimes
the
very
opposite
of
what
they
order
without
admitting
divine
intervention
in
the
affairs
of
humanity
we
cannot
regard
as
the
cause
of
from
the
standpoint
of
is
merely
the
relation
that
exists
between
the
expression
of
will
and
the
execution
of
that
will
by
to
explain
the
conditions
of
that
relationship
we
must
first
establish
a
conception
of
the
expression
of
referring
it
to
man
and
not
to
the
if
the
deity
issues
a
expresses
his
as
ancient
history
tells
the
expression
of
that
will
is
independent
of
time
and
is
not
caused
by
for
the
divinity
is
not
controlled
by
an
but
speaking
of
commands
that
are
the
expression
of
the
will
of
men
acting
in
time
and
in
relation
to
one
to
explain
the
connection
of
commands
with
events
we
must
the
condition
of
all
that
takes
the
continuity
of
movement
in
time
both
of
the
events
and
of
the
person
who
and
the
inevitability
of
the
connection
between
the
person
commanding
and
those
who
execute
his
chapter
vi
only
the
expression
of
the
will
of
the
not
dependent
on
can
relate
to
a
whole
series
of
events
occurring
over
a
period
of
years
or
and
only
the
independent
of
can
by
his
sole
will
determine
the
direction
of
but
man
acts
in
time
and
himself
takes
part
in
what
reinstating
the
first
condition
that
of
we
see
that
no
command
can
be
executed
without
some
preceding
order
having
been
given
rendering
the
execution
of
the
last
command
no
command
ever
appears
or
itself
covers
a
whole
series
of
but
each
command
follows
from
and
never
refers
to
a
whole
series
of
events
but
always
to
one
moment
only
of
an
for
we
say
that
napoleon
ordered
armies
to
go
to
we
combine
in
one
simultaneous
expression
a
whole
series
of
consecutive
commands
dependent
one
on
napoleon
could
not
have
commanded
an
invasion
of
russia
and
never
did
today
he
ordered
such
and
such
papers
to
be
written
to
to
and
to
tomorrow
such
and
such
decrees
and
orders
to
the
the
the
and
so
on
and
so
of
which
formed
a
whole
series
corresponding
to
a
series
of
events
which
brought
the
french
armies
into
if
throughout
his
reign
napoleon
gave
commands
concerning
an
invasion
of
england
and
expended
on
no
other
undertaking
so
much
time
and
and
yet
during
his
whole
reign
never
once
attempted
to
execute
that
design
but
undertook
an
expedition
into
with
which
country
he
considered
it
desirable
to
be
in
alliance
conviction
he
repeatedly
came
about
because
his
commands
did
not
correspond
to
the
course
of
events
in
the
first
but
did
so
correspond
in
the
for
an
order
to
be
certainly
it
is
necessary
that
a
man
should
order
what
can
be
but
to
know
what
can
and
what
cannot
be
executed
is
not
only
in
the
case
of
invasion
of
russia
in
which
millions
but
even
in
the
simplest
for
in
either
case
millions
of
obstacles
may
arise
to
prevent
its
every
order
executed
is
always
one
of
an
immense
number
all
the
impossible
orders
inconsistent
with
the
course
of
events
remain
only
the
possible
ones
get
linked
up
with
a
consecutive
series
of
commands
corresponding
to
a
series
of
and
are
our
false
conception
that
an
event
is
caused
by
a
command
which
precedes
it
is
due
to
the
fact
that
when
the
event
has
taken
place
and
out
of
thousands
of
others
those
few
commands
which
were
consistent
with
that
event
have
been
we
forget
about
the
others
that
were
not
executed
because
they
could
not
apart
from
the
chief
source
of
our
error
in
this
matter
is
due
to
the
fact
that
in
the
historical
accounts
a
whole
series
of
and
petty
such
for
instance
as
all
those
which
led
the
french
armies
to
is
generalized
into
one
event
in
accord
with
the
result
produced
by
that
series
of
and
corresponding
with
this
generalization
the
whole
series
of
commands
is
also
generalized
into
a
single
expression
of
we
say
that
napoleon
wished
to
invade
russia
and
invaded
in
reality
in
all
activity
we
never
find
anything
resembling
an
expression
of
that
but
find
a
series
of
or
expressions
of
his
very
variously
and
indefinitely
amid
a
long
series
of
unexecuted
orders
of
one
for
the
campaign
of
was
carried
because
those
orders
differed
in
any
way
from
the
unexecuted
orders
but
because
they
coincided
with
the
course
of
events
that
led
the
french
army
into
just
as
in
stencil
work
this
or
that
figure
comes
out
not
because
the
color
was
laid
on
from
this
side
or
in
that
but
because
it
was
laid
on
from
all
sides
over
the
figure
cut
in
the
so
that
examining
the
relation
in
time
of
the
commands
to
the
we
find
that
a
command
can
never
be
the
cause
of
the
but
that
a
certain
definite
dependence
exists
between
the
to
understand
in
what
this
dependence
consists
it
is
necessary
to
reinstate
another
omitted
condition
of
every
command
proceeding
not
from
the
deity
but
from
a
which
that
the
man
who
gives
the
command
himself
takes
part
in
the
this
relation
of
the
commander
to
those
he
commands
is
just
what
is
called
this
relation
consists
in
the
for
common
action
people
always
unite
in
certain
in
which
regardless
of
the
difference
of
the
aims
set
for
the
common
the
relation
between
those
taking
part
in
it
is
always
the
men
uniting
in
these
combinations
always
assume
such
relations
toward
one
another
that
the
larger
number
take
a
more
direct
and
the
smaller
number
a
less
direct
in
the
collective
action
for
which
they
have
of
all
the
combinations
in
which
men
unite
for
collective
action
one
of
the
most
striking
and
definite
examples
is
an
every
army
is
composed
of
lower
grades
of
the
rank
and
whom
there
are
always
the
greatest
of
the
next
higher
military
and
noncommissioned
officers
of
whom
there
are
and
of
officers
of
whom
there
are
still
and
so
on
to
the
highest
military
command
which
is
concentrated
in
one
a
military
organization
may
be
quite
correctly
compared
to
a
of
which
the
base
with
the
largest
diameter
consists
of
the
rank
and
the
next
higher
and
smaller
section
of
the
cone
consists
of
the
next
higher
grades
of
the
and
so
on
to
the
the
point
of
which
will
represent
the
the
of
whom
there
are
the
form
the
lower
section
of
the
cone
and
its
the
soldier
himself
does
the
and
and
always
receives
orders
for
these
actions
from
men
above
he
himself
never
gives
an
the
noncommissioned
officers
whom
there
are
perform
the
action
itself
less
frequently
than
the
but
they
already
give
an
officer
still
less
often
acts
directly
but
commands
still
more
a
general
does
nothing
but
command
the
indicates
the
and
hardly
ever
uses
a
weapon
the
never
takes
direct
part
in
the
action
but
only
gives
general
orders
concerning
the
movement
of
the
mass
of
the
a
similar
relation
of
people
to
one
another
is
seen
in
every
combination
of
men
for
common
and
every
and
so
without
particularly
analyzing
all
the
contiguous
sections
of
a
cone
and
of
the
ranks
of
an
or
the
ranks
and
positions
in
any
administrative
or
public
business
whatever
from
the
lowest
to
the
we
see
a
law
by
which
to
take
associated

in
such
relations
that
the
more
directly
they
participate
in
performing
the
action
the
less
they
can
command
and
the
more
numerous
they
while
the
less
their
direct
participation
in

the
more
they
command
and
the
fewer
of
them
there
rising
in
this
way
from
the
lowest
ranks
to
the
man
at
the
who
takes
the
least

in
the
action
and
directs
his
activity
chiefly
to
this
relation
of
the
men
who
command
to
those
they
command
is
what
constitutes
the
essence
of
the
conception
called
having
restored
the
condition
of
time
under
which
all
events
we
find
that
a
command
is
executed
only
when
it
is
related
to
a
corresponding
series
of
restoring
the
essential
condition
of
relation
between
those
who
command
and
those
who
we
find
that
by
the
very
nature
of
the
case
those
who
command
take
the
smallest
part
in
the
action
itself
and
that
their
activity
is
exclusively
directed
to
chapter
vii
when
an
event
is
taking
place
people
express
their
opinions
and
wishes
about
and
as
the
event
results
from
the
collective
activity
of
many
some
one
of
the
opinions
or
wishes
expressed
is
sure
to
be
fulfilled
if
but
when
one
of
the
opinions
expressed
is
that
opinion
gets
connected
with
the
event
as
a
command
preceding
men
are
hauling
a
each
of
them
expresses
his
opinion
as
to
how
and
where
to
haul
they
haul
the
log
and
it
happens
that
this
is
done
as
one
of
them
he
ordered
there
we
have
command
and
power
in
their
primary
the
man
who
worked
most
with
his
hands
could
not
think
so
much
about
what
he
was
or
reflect
on
or
command
what
would
result
from
the
common
while
the
man
who
commanded
more
would
evidently
work
less
with
his
hands
on
account
of
his
greater
verbal
when
some
larger
concourse
of
men
direct
their
activity
to
a
common
aim
there
is
a
yet
sharper
division
of
those
because
their
activity
is
given
to
directing
and
take
less
part
in
the
direct
when
a
man
works
alone
he
always
has
a
certain
set
of
reflections
which
as
it
seems
to
him
directed
his
past
justify
his
present
and
guide
him
in
planning
his
future
just
the
same
is
done
by
a
concourse
of
allowing
those
who
do
not
take
a
direct
part
in
the
activity
to
devise
and
surmises
concerning
their
collective
for
reasons
known
or
unknown
to
us
the
french
began
to
drown
and
kill
one
and
corresponding
to
the
event
its
justification
appears
in
belief
that
this
was
necessary
for
the
welfare
of
for
and
for
people
ceased
to
kill
one
and
this
event
was
accompanied
by
its
justification
in
the
necessity
for
a
centralization
of
resistance
to
and
so
men
went
from
the
west
to
the
east
killing
their
fellow
and
the
event
was
accompanied
by
phrases
about
the
glory
of
the
baseness
of
and
so
history
shows
us
that
these
justifications
of
the
events
have
no
common
sense
and
are
all
as
in
the
case
of
killing
a
man
as
the
result
of
recognizing
his
and
the
killing
of
millions
in
russia
for
the
humiliation
of
but
these
justifications
have
a
very
necessary
significance
in
their
own
these
justifications
release
those
who
produce
the
events
from
moral
these
temporary
aims
are
like
the
broom
fixed
in
front
of
a
locomotive
to
clear
the
snow
from
the
rails
in
they
clear
moral
responsibilities
from
their
without
such
justification
there
would
be
no
reply
to
the
simplest
question
that
presents
itself
when
examining
each
historical
how
is
it
that
millions
of
men
commit
collective
commit
and
so
with
the
present
complex
forms
of
political
and
social
life
in
europe
can
any
event
that
is
not
or
ordered
by
or
newspapers
be
is
there
any
collective
action
which
cannot
find
its
justification
in
political
in
in
the
balance
of
or
in
so
that
every
event
that
occurs
inevitably
coincides
with
some
expressed
wish
receiving
a
presents
itself
as
the
result
of
the
will
of
one
man
or
of
several
in
whatever
direction
a
ship
the
flow
of
the
waves
it
cuts
will
always
be
noticeable
ahead
of
to
those
on
board
the
ship
the
movement
of
those
waves
will
be
the
only
perceptible
only
by
watching
closely
moment
by
moment
the
movement
of
that
flow
and
comparing
it
with
the
movement
of
the
ship
do
we
convince
ourselves
that
every
bit
of
it
is
occasioned
by
the
forward
movement
of
the
and
that
we
were
led
into
error
by
the
fact
that
we
ourselves
were
imperceptibly
we
see
the
same
if
we
watch
moment
by
moment
the
movement
of
historical
characters
the
inevitable
condition
of
all
that
continuity
of
movement
in
and
do
not
lose
sight
of
the
essential
connection
of
historical
persons
with
the
when
the
ship
moves
in
one
direction
there
is
one
and
the
same
wave
ahead
of
when
it
turns
frequently
the
wave
ahead
of
it
also
turns
but
wherever
it
may
turn
there
always
will
be
the
wave
anticipating
its
whatever
happens
it
always
appears
that
just
that
event
was
foreseen
and
wherever
the
ship
may
the
rush
of
water
which
neither
directs
nor
increases
its
movement
foams
ahead
of
and
at
a
distance
seems
to
us
not
merely
to
move
of
itself
but
to
govern
the
movement
examining
only
those
expressions
of
the
will
of
historical
persons
as
were
related
to
historians
have
assumed
that
the
events
depended
on
those
but
examining
the
events
themselves
and
the
connection
in
which
the
historical
persons
stood
to
the
we
have
found
that
they
and
their
orders
were
dependent
on
the
incontestable
proof
of
this
deduction
is
however
many
commands
were
the
event
does
not
take
place
unless
there
are
other
causes
for
but
as
soon
as
an
event
it
what
it
then
out
of
all
the
continually
expressed
wishes
of
different
people
some
will
always
be
found
which
by
their
meaning
and
their
time
of
utterance
are
related
as
commands
to
the
arriving
at
this
conclusion
we
can
reply
directly
and
positively
to
these
two
essential
questions
of
what
is
what
force
produces
the
movement
of
the
power
is
the
relation
of
a
given
person
to
other
in
which
the
more
this
person
expresses
and
justifications
of
the
collective
action
that
is
the
less
is
his
participation
in
that
the
movement
of
nations
is
caused
not
by
nor
by
intellectual
nor
even
by
a
combination
of
the
two
as
historians
have
but
by
the
activity
of
all
the
people
who
participate
in
the
and
who
always
combine
in
such
a
way
that
those
taking
the
largest
direct
share
in
the
event
take
on
themselves
the
least
responsibility
and
vice
morally
the
wielder
of
power
appears
to
cause
the
physically
it
is
those
who
submit
to
the
but
as
the
moral
activity
is
inconceivable
without
the
the
cause
of
the
event
is
neither
in
the
one
nor
in
the
other
but
in
the
union
of
the
or
in
other
the
conception
of
a
cause
is
inapplicable
to
the
phenomena
we
are
in
the
last
analysis
we
reach
the
circle
of
final
limit
to
which
in
every
domain
of
thought
reason
arrives
if
it
is
not
playing
with
the
electricity
produces
heat
produces
atoms
attract
each
other
and
atoms
repel
one
speaking
of
the
interaction
of
heat
and
electricity
and
of
we
cannot
say
why
this
and
we
say
that
it
is
so
because
it
is
inconceivable
because
it
must
be
so
and
that
it
is
a
the
same
applies
to
historical
why
war
and
revolution
occur
we
do
not
we
only
know
that
to
produce
the
one
or
the
other
people
combine
in
a
certain
formation
in
which
they
all
take
and
we
say
that
this
is
so
because
it
is
unthinkable
or
in
other
words
that
it
is
a
chapter
viii
if
history
dealt
only
with
external
the
establishment
of
this
simple
and
obvious
law
would
suffice
and
we
should
have
finished
our
but
the
law
of
history
relates
to
a
particle
of
matter
cannot
tell
us
that
it
does
not
feel
the
law
of
attraction
or
repulsion
and
that
that
law
is
but
who
is
the
subject
of
says
i
am
free
and
am
therefore
not
subject
to
the
the
presence
of
the
problem
of
free
though
is
felt
at
every
step
of
all
seriously
thinking
historians
have
involuntarily
encountered
this
all
the
contradictions
and
obscurities
of
history
and
the
false
path
historical
science
has
followed
are
due
solely
to
the
lack
of
a
solution
of
that
if
the
will
of
every
man
were
that
if
each
man
could
act
as
he
all
history
would
be
a
series
of
disconnected
if
in
a
thousand
years
even
one
man
in
a
million
could
act
that
as
he
it
is
evident
that
one
single
free
act
of
that
in
violation
of
the
laws
governing
human
action
would
destroy
the
possibility
of
the
existence
of
any
laws
for
the
whole
of
if
there
be
a
single
law
governing
the
actions
of
free
will
cannot
for
then
will
is
subject
to
that
in
this
contradiction
lies
the
problem
of
free
which
from
most
ancient
times
has
occupied
the
best
human
minds
and
from
most
ancient
times
has
been
presented
in
its
whole
tremendous
the
problem
is
that
regarding
man
as
a
subject
of
observation
from
whatever
point
of
or
find
a
general
law
of
necessity
to
which
he
all
that
is
but
regarding
him
from
within
ourselves
as
what
we
are
conscious
we
feel
ourselves
to
be
this
consciousness
is
a
source
of
quite
apart
from
and
independent
of
through
his
reason
man
observes
but
only
through
consciousness
does
he
know
apart
from
consciousness
of
self
no
observation
or
application
of
reason
is
to
and
draw
man
must
first
of
all
be
conscious
of
himself
as
a
man
is
only
conscious
of
himself
as
a
living
being
by
the
fact
that
he
that
is
conscious
of
his
but
his
forms
the
essence
of
his
recognizes
can
but
as
observing
man
sees
that
his
will
is
always
directed
by
one
and
the
same
law
he
observes
the
necessity
of
taking
using
his
or
anything
he
cannot
recognize
this
varying
direction
of
his
will
otherwise
than
as
a
limitation
of
were
it
not
free
it
could
not
be
a
will
seems
to
him
to
be
limited
just
because
he
is
not
conscious
of
it
except
as
you
i
am
not
but
i
have
lifted
my
hand
and
let
it
everyone
understands
that
this
illogical
reply
is
an
irrefutable
demonstration
of
that
reply
is
the
expression
of
a
consciousness
that
is
not
subject
to
if
the
consciousness
of
freedom
were
not
a
separate
and
independent
source
of
it
would
be
subject
to
reasoning
and
to
but
in
fact
such
subjection
does
not
exist
and
is
a
series
of
experiments
and
arguments
proves
to
every
man
that
as
an
object
of
is
subject
to
certain
and
man
submits
to
them
and
never
resists
the
laws
of
gravity
or
impermeability
once
he
has
become
acquainted
with
but
the
same
series
of
experiments
and
arguments
proves
to
him
that
the
complete
freedom
of
which
he
is
conscious
in
himself
is
and
that
his
every
action
depends
on
his
his
and
the
motives
acting
upon
yet
man
never
submits
to
the
deductions
of
these
experiments
and
having
learned
from
experiment
and
argument
that
a
stone
falls
a
man
indubitably
believes
this
and
always
expects
the
law
that
he
has
learned
to
be
but
learning
just
as
certainly
that
his
will
is
subject
to
he
does
not
and
cannot
believe
however
often
experiment
and
reasoning
may
show
a
man
that
under
the
same
conditions
and
with
the
same
character
he
will
do
the
same
thing
as
yet
when
under
the
same
conditions
and
with
the
same
character
he
approaches
for
the
thousandth
time
the
action
that
always
ends
in
the
same
he
feels
as
certainly
convinced
as
before
the
experiment
that
he
can
act
as
he
every
savage
or
however
incontestably
reason
and
experiment
may
prove
to
him
that
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
two
different
courses
of
action
in
precisely
the
same
feels
that
without
this
irrational
conception
constitutes
the
essence
of
he
cannot
imagine
he
feels
that
however
impossible
it
may
it
is
for
without
this
conception
of
freedom
not
only
would
he
be
unable
to
understand
but
he
would
be
unable
to
live
for
a
single
he
could
not
because
all
all
his
impulses
to
are
only
efforts
to
increase
wealth
and
fame
and
power
and
strength
and
health
and
culture
and
work
and
repletion
and
virtue
and
are
only
greater
or
lesser
degrees
of
a
man
having
no
freedom
cannot
be
conceived
of
except
as
deprived
of
if
the
conception
of
freedom
appears
to
reason
to
be
a
senseless
contradiction
like
the
possibility
of
performing
two
actions
at
one
and
the
same
instant
of
or
of
an
effect
without
a
that
only
proves
that
consciousness
is
not
subject
to
this
irrefutable
consciousness
of
uncontrolled
by
experiment
or
recognized
by
all
thinkers
and
felt
by
everyone
without
this
consciousness
without
which
no
conception
of
man
is
possible
constitutes
the
other
side
of
the
man
is
the
creation
of
an
and
what
is
the
conception
of
which
arises
from
the
consciousness
of
that
is
a
question
for
the
actions
of
men

subject
to
general
immutable
laws
expressed
in
what
is

to
the
conception
of
which
results
from
the
conception
of
that
is
a
question
for
actions
proceed
from
his
innate
character
and
the
motives
acting
upon
what
is
conscience
and
the
perception
of
right
and
wrong
in
actions
that
follows
from
the
consciousness
of
that
is
a
question
for
man
in
connection
with
the
general
life
of
humanity
appears
subject
to
laws
which
determine
that
but
the
same
man
apart
from
that
connection
appears
to
be
how
should
the
past

of
nations
and
of
humanity
be
the
result
of
the

as
the
result
of
the
activity

of
the
popularization
of
thanks
to
that
most
powerful
engine
of
the
diffusion
of

the
question
of
the
freedom
of

been
put
on
a
level
on
which
the
question
itself

our
time
the
majority
of
advanced

crowd

taken
the
work
of
the
naturalists
who
deal
with
one
side

a
solution

that

by
muscular
movements
and
muscular
movements
are
conditioned
by
the
activity
of
the
the
soul
and
free
will
do
not
exist
because
at
an
unknown
period
of
time
we
sprang
from
the
they
say
not
at
all
suspecting
that
thousands
of
years
ago
that
same
law
of
necessity
which
with
such
ardor
they
are
now
trying
to
prove
by
physiology
and
comparative
zoology
was
not
merely
acknowledged
by
all
the
religions
and
all
the
but
has
never
been
they
do
not
see
that
the
role
of
the
natural
sciences
in
this
matter
is
merely
to
serve
as
an
instrument
for
the
illumination
of
one
side
of
for
the
fact
from
the
point
of
view
of

and
the

are
merely
secretions
of
the
and
that
man
following
the
general
law
may
have
developed
from
lower
animals
at
some
unknown
period
of
only
explains
from
a
fresh
side
the
truth
admitted
thousands
of
years
ago
by
all
the
religious
and
philosophic
from
the
point
of
view
of
reason
man
is
subject
to
the
law
of
but
it
does
not
advance
by
a
breadth
the
solution
of
the
which
has
based
on
the
consciousness
of
if
men
descended
from
the
apes
at
an
unknown
period
of
that
is
as
comprehensible
as
that
they
were
made
from
a
handful
of
earth
at
a
certain
period
of
time
the
first
case
the
unknown
quantity
is
the
in
the
second
case
it
is
the
and
the
question
of
how
consciousness
of
freedom
is
to
be
reconciled
with
the
law
of
necessity
to
which
he
is
subject
cannot
be
solved
by
comparative
physiology
and
for
in
a
a
or
an

the

ix
for
the
solution
of
the
question
of
free

or
history
has
this
advantage
over
other
branches
of
knowledge
in
which
the
question
is
dealt
that
for
history
this
question
does
not
refer
to
the
essence
of
free
will
but
its
manifestation
in
the
past
and
under

in

to
this
history
stands
to
the
other
sciences
as
experimental
science
stands
to
abstract
the
subject
for
history
is
not
will
itself
but
our
presentation
of
and
so
for
the
insoluble
mystery
presented
by
the
incompatibility
of
free
will
and
inevitability
does
not
exist
as
it
does
for
and
history
surveys
a
presentation
of
life
in
which
the
union
of
these
two
contradictions
has
already
taken
in
actual
life
each
historic
each
human
is
very
clearly
and
definitely
understood
without
any
sense
of
although
each
event
presents
itself
as
partly
free
and
partly
to
solve
the
question
of
how
freedom
and
necessity
are
combined
and
what
constitutes
the
essence
of
these
two
the
philosophy
of
history
can
and
should
follow
a
path
contrary
to
that
taken
by
other
instead
of
first
defining
the
conceptions
of
freedom
and
inevitability
in
and
then
ranging
the
phenomena
of
life
under
those
history
should
deduce
a
definition
of
the
conception
of
freedom
and
inevitability
themselves
from
the
immense
quantity
of
phenomena
of
which
it
is
cognizant
and
that
always
appear
dependent
on
these
two
whatever
presentation
of
the
activity
of
many
men
or
of
an
individual
we
may
we
always
regard
it
as
the
result
partly
of
free
will
and
partly
of
the
law
of
whether
we
speak
of
the
migration
of
the
peoples
and
the
incursions
of
the
or
of
the
decrees
of
napoleon
or
of
action
an
hour
ago
in
choosing
one
direction
out
of
several
for
his
we
are
unconscious
of
any
the
degree
of
freedom
and
inevitability
governing
the
actions
of
these
people
is
clearly
defined
for
our
conception
of
the
degree
of
freedom
often
varies
according
to
differences
in
the
point
of
view
from
which
we
regard
the
but
every
human
action
appears
to
us
as
a
certain
combination
of
freedom
and
in
every
action
we
examine
we
see
a
certain
measure
of
freedom
and
a
certain
measure
of
and
always
the
more
freedom
we
see
in
any
action
the
less
inevitability
do
we
and
the
more
inevitability
the
less
the
proportion
of
freedom
to
inevitability
decreases
and
increases
according
to
the
point
of
view
from
which
the
action
is
but
their
relation
is
always
one
of
inverse
a
sinking
man
who
clutches
at
another
and
drowns
or
a
hungry
mother
exhausted
by
feeding
her
who
steals
some
or
a
man
trained
to
discipline
who
on
duty
at
the
word
of
command
kills
a
defenseless
seem
less
that
less
free
and
more
subject
to
the
law
of
to
one
who
knows
the
circumstances
in
which
these
people
were
and
more
free
to
one
who
does
not
know
that
the
man
was
himself
that
the
mother
was
that
the
soldier
was
in
the
and
so
similarly
a
man
who
committed
a
murder
twenty
years
ago
and
has
since
lived
peaceably
and
harmlessly
in
society
seems
less
guilty
and
his
action
more
due
to
the
law
of
to
someone
who
considers
his
action
after
twenty
years
have
elapsed
than
to
one
who
examined
it
the
day
after
it
was
and
in
the
same
way
every
action
of
an
or
highly
excited
man
appears
less
free
and
more
inevitable
to
one
who
knows
the
mental
condition
of
him
who
committed
the
and
seems
more
free
and
less
inevitable
to
one
who
does
not
know
in
all
these
cases
the
conception
of
freedom
is
increased
or
diminished
and
the
conception
of
compulsion
is
correspondingly
decreased
or
according
to
the
point
of
view
from
which
the
action
is
so
that
the
greater
the
conception
of
necessity
the
smaller
the
conception
of
freedom
and
vice
the
common
sense
of
the
science
of
and
history
itself
understand
alike
this
relation
between
necessity
and
all
cases
without
exception
in
which
our
conception
of
freedom
and
necessity
is
increased
and
diminished
depend
on
three
the
relation
to
the
external
world
of
the
man
who
commits
the
his
relation
to
his
relation
to
the
causes
leading
to
the
the
first
consideration
is
the
clearness
of
our
perception
of
the
relation
to
the
external
world
and
the
greater
or
lesser
clearness
of
our
understanding
of
the
definite
position
occupied
by
the
man
in
relation
to
everything
coexisting
with
this
is
what
makes
it
evident
that
a
drowning
man
is
less
free
and
more
subject
to
necessity
than
one
standing
on
dry
and
that
makes
the
actions
of
a
man
closely
connected
with
others
in
a
thickly
populated
or
of
one
bound
by
or
business
seem
certainly
less
free
and
more
subject
to
necessity
than
those
of
a
man
living
in
solitude
and
if
we
consider
a
man
apart
from
his
relation
to
everything
around
each
action
of
his
seems
to
us
but
if
we
see
his
relation
to
anything
around
if
we
see
his
connection
with
anything
with
a
man
who
speaks
to
a
book
he
the
work
on
which
he
is
even
with
the
air
he
breathes
or
the
light
that
falls
on
the
things
about
see
that
each
of
these
circumstances
has
an
influence
on
him
and
controls
at
least
some
side
of
his
and
the
more
we
perceive
of
these
influences
the
more
our
conception
of
his
freedom
diminishes
and
the
more
our
conception
of
the
necessity
that
weighs
on
him
the
second
consideration
is
the
more
or
less
evident
time
relation
of
the
man
to
the
world
and
the
clearness
of
our
perception
of
the
place
the
action
occupies
in
that
is
the
ground
which
makes
the
fall
of
the
first
resulting
in
the
production
of
the
human
appear
evidently
less
free
than
a
entry
into
marriage
it
is
the
reason
why
the
life
and
activity
of
people
who
lived
centuries
ago
and
are
connected
with
me
in
time
cannot
seem
to
me
as
free
as
the
life
of
a
the
consequences
of
which
are
still
unknown
to
the
degree
of
our
conception
of
freedom
or
inevitability
depends
in
this
respect
on
the
greater
or
lesser
lapse
of
time
between
the
performance
of
the
action
and
our
judgment
of
if
i
examine
an
act
i
performed
a
moment
ago
in
approximately
the
same
circumstances
as
those
i
am
in
my
action
appears
to
me
undoubtedly
but
if
i
examine
an
act
performed
a
month
then
being
in
different
i
cannot
help
recognizing
that
if
that
act
had
not
been
committed
much
that
resulted
from
and
even
not
have
taken
if
i
reflect
on
an
action
still
more
ten
years
ago
or
then
the
consequences
of
my
action
are
still
plainer
to
me
and
i
find
it
hard
to
imagine
what
would
have
happened
had
that
action
not
been
the
farther
i
go
back
in
or
what
is
the
same
thing
the
farther
i
go
forward
in
my
the
more
doubtful
becomes
my
belief
in
the
freedom
of
my
in
history
we
find
a
very
similar
progress
of
conviction
concerning
the
part
played
by
free
will
in
the
general
affairs
of
a
contemporary
event
seems
to
us
to
be
indubitably
the
doing
of
all
the
known
but
with
a
more
remote
event
we
already
see
its
inevitable
results
which
prevent
our
considering
anything
else
and
the
farther
we
go
back
in
examining
events
the
less
arbitrary
do
they
the
war
appears
to
us
undoubtedly
the
result
of
the
crafty
conduct
of
and
so
the
napoleonic
wars
still
seem
to
though
already
to
be
the
outcome
of
their
but
in
the
crusades
we
already
see
an
event
occupying
its
definite
place
in
history
and
without
which
we
cannot
imagine
the
modern
history
of
though
to
the
chroniclers
of
the
crusades
that
event
appeared
as
merely
due
to
the
will
of
certain
in
regard
to
the
migration
of
the
peoples
it
does
not
enter
head
today
to
suppose
that
the
renovation
of
the
european
world
depended
on
the
farther
back
in
history
the
object
of
our
observation
the
more
doubtful
does
the
free
will
of
those
concerned
in
the
event
become
and
the
more
manifest
the
law
of
the
third
consideration
is
the
degree
to
which
we
apprehend
that
endless
chain
of
causation
inevitably
demanded
by
in
which
each
phenomenon
and
therefore
every
must
have
its
definite
place
as
a
result
of
what
has
gone
before
and
as
a
cause
of
what
will
the
better
we
are
acquainted
with
the
and
historical
laws
deduced
by
observation
and
by
which
man
is
and
the
more
correctly
we
perceive
the
and
historical
causes
of
the
and
the
simpler
the
action
we
are
observing
and
the
less
complex
the
character
and
mind
of
the
man
in
the
more
subject
to
inevitability
and
the
less
free
do
our
actions
and
those
of
others
when
we
do
not
at
all
understand
the
cause
of
an
whether
a
a
good
or
even
one
that
is
simply
we
ascribe
a
greater
amount
of
freedom
to
in
the
case
of
a
crime
we
most
urgently
demand
the
punishment
for
such
an
in
the
case
of
a
virtuous
act
we
rate
its
merit
most
in
an
indifferent
case
we
recognize
in
it
more
and
but
if
even
one
of
the
innumerable
causes
of
the
act
is
known
to
us
we
recognize
a
certain
element
of
necessity
and
are
less
insistent
on
punishment
for
the
or
the
acknowledgment
of
the
merit
of
the
virtuous
or
the
freedom
of
the
apparently
original
that
a
criminal
was
reared
among
male
factors
mitigates
his
fault
in
our
the
of
a
father
or
or
with
the
possibility
of
a
is
more
comprehensible
than
gratuitous
and
therefore
seems
less
deserving
of
sympathy
and
less
the
result
of
free
the
founder
of
a
sect
or
or
an
impresses
us
less
when
we
know
how
or
by
what
the
way
was
prepared
for
his
if
we
have
a
large
range
of
if
our
observation
is
constantly
directed
to
seeking
the
correlation
of
cause
and
effect
in
their
actions
appear
to
us
more
under
compulsion
and
less
free
the
more
correctly
we
connect
the
effects
with
the
if
we
examined
simple
actions
and
had
a
vast
number
of
such
actions
under
our
conception
of
their
inevitability
would
be
still
the
dishonest
conduct
of
the
son
of
a
dishonest
the
misconduct
of
a
woman
who
had
fallen
into
bad
a
relapse
into
and
so
on
are
actions
that
seem
to
us
less
free
the
better
we
understand
their
if
the
man
whose
actions
we
are
considering
is
on
a
very
low
stage
of
mental
like
a
a
or
a
knowing
the
causes
of
the
act
and
the
simplicity
of
the
character
and
intelligence
in
we
see
so
large
an
element
of
necessity
and
so
little
free
will
that
as
soon
as
we
know
the
cause
prompting
the
action
we
can
foretell
the
on
these
three
considerations
alone
is
based
the
conception
of
irresponsibility
for
crimes
and
the
extenuating
circumstances
admitted
by
all
legislative
the
responsibility
appears
greater
or
less
according
to
our
greater
or
lesser
knowledge
of
the
circumstances
in
which
the
man
was
placed
whose
action
is
being
and
according
to
the
greater
or
lesser
interval
of
time
between
the
commission
of
the
action
and
its
and
according
to
the
greater
or
lesser
understanding
of
the
causes
that
led
to
the
chapter
x
thus
our
conception
of
free
will
and
inevitability
gradually
diminishes
or
increases
according
to
the
greater
or
lesser
connection
with
the
external
the
greater
or
lesser
remoteness
of
and
the
greater
or
lesser
dependence
on
the
causes
in
relation
to
which
we
contemplate
a
so
that
if
we
examine
the
case
of
a
man
whose
connection
with
the
external
world
is
well
where
the
time
between
the
action
and
its
examination
is
and
where
the
causes
of
the
action
are
most
we
get
the
conception
of
a
maximum
of
inevitability
and
a
minimum
of
free
if
we
examine
a
man
little
dependent
on
external
whose
action
was
performed
very
and
the
causes
of
whose
action
are
beyond
our
we
get
the
conception
of
a
minimum
of
inevitability
and
a
maximum
of
in
neither
we
may
change
our
point
of
however
plain
we
may
make

ourselves

to
however
long
or
short

period
of

we
may

a

inevitably
conditioned
by
what
surrounds
him
and
by
his
own

lift
my
arm
and
let
it
my
action
seems
to
me
but
asking
myself
whether
i
could
raise
my
arm
in
every
i
see
that
i
raised
it
in
the
direction
in
which
there
was
least
obstruction
to
that
action
either
from
things
around
me
or
from
the
construction
of
my
own
i
chose
one
out
of
all
the
possible
directions
because
in
it
there
were
fewest
for
my
action
to
be
free
it
was
necessary
that
it
should
encounter
no
to
conceive
of
a
man
being
free
we
must
imagine
him
outside
which
is
evidently
however
much
we
approximate
the
time
of
judgment
to
the
time
of
the
we
never
get
a
conception
of
freedom
in
for
if
i
examine
an
action
committed
a
second
ago
i
must
still
recognize
it
as
not

it
is
irrevocably
linked
to
the
moment
at
which
it
was
can
i
lift
my
i
lift
but
ask
could
i
have
abstained
from
lifting
my
arm
at
the
moment
that
has
already
to
convince
myself
of
this
i
do
not
lift
it
the
next
but
i
am
not
now
abstaining
from
doing
so
at
the
first
moment
when
i
asked
the
time
has
gone
by
which
i
could
not
the
arm
i
then
lifted
is
no
longer
the
same
as
the
arm
i
now
refrain
from
nor
is
the
air
in
which
i
lifted
it
the
same
that
now
surrounds
the
moment
in
which
the
first
movement
was
made
is
and
at
that
moment
i
could
make
only
one
and
whatever
movement
i
made
would
be
the
only
that
i
did
not
lift
my
arm
a
moment
later
does
not
prove
that
i
could
have
abstained
from
lifting
it
and
since
i
could
make
only
one
movement
at
that
single
moment
of
it
could
not
have
been
any
to
imagine
it
as
it
is
necessary
to
imagine
it
in
the
on
the
boundary
between
the
past
and
the
outside
which
is
however
much
the
difficulty
of
understanding
the
causes
may
be
we
never
reach
a
conception
of
complete
that
an
absence
of
however
inaccessible
to
us
may
be
the
cause
of
the
expression
of
will
in
any
our
own
or
the
first
demand
of
reason
is
the
assumption
of
and
search
for
a
for
without
a
cause
no
phenomenon
is
i
raise
my
arm
to
perform
an
action
independently
of
any
but
my
wish
to
perform
an
action
without
a
cause
is
the
cause
of
my
but
even
a
man
quite
exempt
from
all
examining
only
his
momentary
action
in
the
unevoked
by
any
were
to
admit
so
infinitely
small
a
remainder
of
inevitability
as
equaled
we
should
even
then
not
have
arrived
at
the
conception
of
complete
freedom

for
a
being
uninfluenced
by
the
external
standing
outside

and
independent

no
longer

the

way
we
can
never
imagine
the
action
of
a
man
quite
devoid
of
freedom
and
entirely
subject
to
the
law
of
however
we
may
increase
our
knowledge
of
the
conditions
of
space
in
which
man
is
that
knowledge
can
never
be
for
the
number
of
those
conditions
is
as
infinite
as
the
infinity
of
and
therefore
so
long
as
not
all
the
conditions
influencing
men
are
there
is
no
complete
inevitability
but
a
certain
measure
of
freedom
however
we
may
prolong
the
period
of
time
between
the
action
we
are
examining
and
the
judgment
upon
that
period
will
be
while
time
is
and
so
in
this
respect
too
there
can
never
be
absolute
however
accessible
may
be
the
chain
of
causation
of
any
we
shall
never
know
the
whole
chain
since
it
is
and
so
again
we
never
reach
absolute
but
besides
even
admitting
the
remaining
minimum
of
freedom
to
equal
we
assumed
in
some
given
for
instance
in
that
of
a
dying
an
unborn
or
an
absence
of
by
so
doing
we
should
destroy
the
very
conception
of
man
in
the
case
we
are
for
as
soon
as
there
is
no
freedom
there
is
also
no
and
so
the
conception
of
the
action
of
a
man
subject
solely
to
the
law
of
inevitability
without
any
element
of
freedom
is
just
as
impossible
as
the
conception
of
a
completely
free
and
so
to
imagine
the
action
of
a
man
entirely
subject
to
the
law
of
inevitability
without
any
we
must
assume
the
knowledge
of
an
infinite
number
of
space
an
infinitely
long
period
of
and
an
infinite
series
of
to
imagine
a
man
perfectly
free
and
not
subject
to
the
law
of
we
must
imagine
him
all
beyond
beyond
and
free
from
dependence
on

the
first
if
inevitability
were
possible
without
freedom
we
should
have
reached
a
definition
of
inevitability
by
the
laws
of
inevitability
that
a
mere
form
without
in
the
second
if
freedom
were
possible
without
inevitability
we
should
have
arrived
at
unconditioned
freedom
beyond
and
which
by
the
fact
of
its
being
unconditioned
and
unlimited
would
be
or
mere
content
without
we
should
in
fact
have
reached
those
two
fundamentals
of
which
whole
outlook
on
the
universe
is
incomprehensible

the

inevitability

only
by
separating
the
two
sources

one
another
as

do
we
get
the
mutually
exclusive
and
separately
incomprehensible
conceptions
of
freedom
and
only
by
uniting
them
do
we
get
a
clear
conception
of
apart
from
these
two
concepts
which
in
their
union
mutually
define
one
another
as
form
and
no
conception
of
life
is
all
that
we
know
of
the
life
of
man
is
merely
a
certain
relation
of
free
will
to
that
of
consciousness
to
the
laws
of
all
that
we
know
of
the
external
world
of
nature
is
only
a
certain
relation
of
the
forces
of
nature
to
or
of
the
essence
of
life
to
the
laws
of
the
great
natural
forces
lie
outside
us
and
we
are
not
conscious
of
we
call
those
forces
animal
and
so
but
we
are
conscious
of
the
force
of
life
in
man
and
we
call
that
but
just
as
the
force
of
incomprehensible
in
itself
but
felt
by
every
is
understood
by
us
only
to
the
extent
to
which
we
know
the
laws
of
inevitability
to
which
it
is
subject
the
first
knowledge
that
all
bodies
have
up
to
so
too
the
force
of
free
incomprehensible
in
itself
but
of
which
everyone
is
is
intelligible
to
us
only
in
as
far
as
we
know
the
laws
of
inevitability
to
which
it
is
subject
the
fact
that
every
man
up
to
the
knowledge
of
the
most
complex
economic
and
historic
all
knowledge
is
merely
a
bringing
of
this
essence
of
life
under
the
laws
of
free
will
differs
from
every
other
force
in
that
man
is
directly
conscious
of
but
in
the
eyes
of
reason
it
in
no
way
differs
from
any
other
the
forces
of
or
chemical
affinity
are
only
distinguished
from
one
another
in
that
they
are
differently
defined
by
just
so
the
force
of
free
will
is
distinguished
by
reason
from
the
other
forces
of
nature
only
by
the
definition
reason
gives
apart
from
that
apart
from
the
laws
of
reason
that
define
differs
in
no
way
from
or
or
the
force
that
makes
things
for
it
is
only
a
momentary
undefinable
sensation
of
and
as
the
undefinable
essence
of
the

the

the
undefinable
essence
of
the
forces
of
heat
and
or
of

or
of
the

the

of

so
just
in
the
same
way
does
the
force
of
free
will
form
the
content
of
but
just
as
the
subject
of
every
science
is
the
manifestation
of
this
unknown
essence
of
life
while
that
essence
itself
can
only
be
the
subject
of
even
the

of
the

in
human
beings

and
in
dependence

the

what

an

history
examines
the
manifestations
of
free
will
in
connection
with
the
external
world
in
time
and
in
dependence
on
that
it
defines
this
freedom
by
the
laws
of
and
so
history
is
a
science
only
in
so
far
as
this
free
will
is
defined
by
those
the
recognition
of
free
will
as
something
capable
of
influencing
historical
that
as
not
subject
to
is
the
same
for
history
as
the
recognition
of
a
free
force
moving
the
heavenly
bodies
would
be
for
that
assumption
would
destroy
the
possibility
of
the
existence
of
that
of
any
science
if
there
is
even
a
single
body
moving
then
the
laws
of
kepler
and
newton
are
negatived
and
no
conception
of
the
movement
of
the
heavenly
bodies
any
longer
if
any
single
action
is
due
to
free
then
not
a
single
historical
law
can
nor
any
conception
of
historical
for
lines
exist
of
the
movement
of
human
one
end
of
which
is
hidden
in
the
unknown
but
at
the
other
end
of
which
a
consciousness
of
will
in
the
present
moves
in
and
dependence
on
the
more
this
field
of
motion
spreads
out
before
our
the
more
evident
are
the
laws
of
that
to
discover
and
define
those
laws
is
the
problem
of
from
the
standpoint
from
which
the
science
of
history
now
regards
its
subject
on
the
path
it
now
seeking
the
causes
of
events
in
a
scientific
enunciation
of
those
laws
is
for
however
free
will
may
be
as
soon
as
we
recognize
it
as
a
force
not
subject
to
the
existence
of
law
becomes
only
by
reducing
this
element
of
free
will
to
the
that
by
regarding
it
as
an
infinitely
small
can
we
convince
ourselves
of
the
absolute
inaccessibility
of
the
and
then
instead
of
seeking
history
will
take
the
discovery
of
laws
as
its
the
search
for
these
laws
has
long
been
begun
and
the
new
methods
of
thought
which
history
must
adopt
are
being
worked
out
simultaneously
with
the
toward
dissecting
and
dissecting
the
causes
of
old
method
of
history
is
all
human
sciences
have
traveled
along
that
arriving
at
the
most
exact
of
abandons
the
process
of
analysis
and
enters
on
the
new
process
of
the
integration
of
infinitely
abandoning
the
conception
of
mathematics
seeks
that
the
property
common
to
all
infinitely
in
another
form
but
along
the
same
path
of
reflection
the
other
sciences
have
when
newton
enunciated
the
law
of
gravity
he
did
not
say
that
the
sun
or
the
earth
had
a
property
of
he
said
that
all
bodies
from
the
largest
to
the
smallest
have
the
property
of
attracting

leaving
aside
the
question
of

expressed
the

common
to
all

from
the
infinitely

the

done
by
the

the
question

on

if
history
has
for
its
object
the
study
of

of

and
not
the

chapter
xii
from
the
time
the
law
of
copernicus
was
discovered
and
the
mere
recognition
of
the
fact
that
it
was
not
the
sun
but
the
earth
that
moves
sufficed
to
destroy
the
whole
cosmography
of
the
by
disproving
that
law
it
might
have
been
possible
to
retain
the
old
conception
of
the
movements
of
the
but
without
disproving
it
would
seem
impossible
to
continue
studying
the
ptolemaic
but
even
after
the
discovery
of
the
law
of
copernicus
the
ptolemaic
worlds
were
still
studied
for
a
long
from
the
time
the
first
person
said
and
proved
that
the
number
of
births
or
of
crimes
is
subject
to
mathematical
and
that
this
or
that
mode
of
government
is
determined
by
certain
geographical
and
economic
and
that
certain
relations
of
population
to
soil
produce
migrations
of
the
foundations
on
which
history
had
been
built
were
destroyed
in
their
by
refuting
these
new
laws
the
former
view
of
history
might
have
been
but
without
refuting
them
it
would
seem
impossible
to
continue
studying
historic
events
as
the
results
of
free
for
if
a
certain
mode
of
government
was
established
or
certain
migrations
of
peoples
took
place
in
consequence
of
such
and
such

the
free
will
of
those
individuals
who
appear
to
us
to
have
established
that
mode
of
government
or
occasioned
the
migrations
can
no
longer
be
regarded
as
the
and
yet
the
former
history
continues
to
be
studied
side
by
side
with
the
laws
of
political
comparative
and
which
directly
contradict

the
struggle

the
old
views
and

and
stubbornly
fought
out
in

theology
stood
on
guard
for
the
old
views
and
accused
the
new
of
violating
but
when
truth
theology
established
itself
just
as
firmly
on
the
new
just
as
prolonged
and
stubborn
is
the
struggle
now
proceeding
between
the
old
and
the
new
conception
of
and
theology
in
the
same
way
stands
on
guard
for
the
old
and
accuses
the
new
view
of
subverting
in
the
one
case
as
in
the
on
both
sides
the
struggle
provokes
passion
and
stifles
on
the
one
hand
there
is
fear
and
regret
for
the
loss
of
the
whole
edifice
constructed
through
the
on
the
other
is
the
passion
for
to
the
men
who
fought
against
the
rising
truths
of
physical
it
seemed
that
if
they
admitted
that
truth
it
would
destroy
faith
in
in
the
creation
of
the
and
in
the
miracle
of
joshua
the
son
of
to
the
defenders
of
the
laws
of
copernicus
and
to
voltaire
for
it
seemed
that
the
laws
of
astronomy
destroyed
and
he
utilized
the
law
of
gravitation
as
a
weapon
against
just
so
it
now
seems
as
if
we
have
only
to
admit
the
law
of
to
destroy
the
conception
of
the
of
good
and
and
all
the
institutions
of
state
and
church
that
have
been
built
up
on
those
so
like
voltaire
in
his
uninvited
defenders
of
the
law
of
inevitability
today
use
that
law
as
a
weapon
against
though
the
law
of
inevitability
in
like
the
law
of
copernicus
in
far
from
even
strengthens
the
foundation
on
which
the
institutions
of
state
and
church
are
as
in
the
question
of
astronomy
so
in
the
question
of
history
the
whole
difference
of
opinion
is
based
on
the
recognition
or
nonrecognition
of
something
serving
as
the
measure
of
visible
in
astronomy
it
was
the
immovability
of
the
in
history
it
is
the
independence
of
as
with
astronomy
the
difficulty
of
recognizing
the
motion
of
the
earth
lay
in
abandoning
the
immediate
sensation
of
the
fixity
and
of
the
motion
of
the
so
in
history
the
difficulty
of
recognizing
the
subjection
of
personality
to
the
laws
of
and
cause
lies
in
renouncing
the
direct
feeling
of
the
independence
of
own
but
as
in
astronomy
the
new
view
is
true
that
we
do
not
feel
the
movement
of
the
but
by
admitting
its
immobility
we
arrive
at
while
by
admitting
its
motion
we
do
not
we
arrive
at
so
also
in
history
the
new
view
is
true
that
we
are
not
conscious
of
our
but
by
admitting
our
free
will
we
arrive
at
while
by
admitting
our
dependence
on
the
external
on
and
on
we
arrive
at
in
the
first
case
it
was
necessary
to
renounce
the
consciousness
of
an
unreal
immobility
in
space
and
to
recognize
a
motion
we
did
not
in
the
present
case
it
is
similarly
necessary
to
renounce
a
freedom
that
does
not
and
to
recognize
a
dependence
of
which
we
are
not
